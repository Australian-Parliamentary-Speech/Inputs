              <span class="HPS-Small">Falun Gong (also known as Falun Dafa) is a spiritual practice in the Buddhist tradition centred on the principles of truthfulness, compassion, and forbearance. The practice aims to improve physical, mental, and spiritual well-being through meditation and moral improvement. In 1999, an estimated 70-100 million followers of Falun Gong in China became the target of suppression when the ruling communist regime saw the popularity of the practice as a threat. For the past 25 years, Falun Gong practitioners have been subjected to the most brutal extermination campaign, with widespread physical, mental, sexual, and psychiatric abuse. In addition, the China Tribunal concluded in 2019 that "forced organ harvesting has been committed for years throughout China on a significant scale and that Falun Gong practitioners have been one—and probably the main- source of organ supply." </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">According to the Climate Council, Australia's target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 43% below 2005 levels by 2030 is insufficient to prevent self-sustaining and irreversible climate change of catastrophic levels. Instead, they present a minimum 75% reduction as imperative. As a country with one of the highest greenhouse gas emission rates per capita, it is Australia's duty to reduce emissions faster in order to protect our own and the world's environments and people. </span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to correspondence of 14 February 2022 to the former Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon Alex Hawke MP, enclosing Petition EN3685, with 640 signatures, concerning the reinstatement of expired Skilled-Recognised Graduate (subclass 476) visas for those impacted by the COVID-19 international travel restrictions. Your correspondence has been referred to me as the matters falls within my portfolio responsibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On the 7 March 2022, the former Government announced several concessions for visa holders impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic travel restrictions. This included current and former subclass 476 visa holders who had lost time in Australia having their visas extended.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 5 April 2022, almost 3,000 eligible subclass 476 visa holders had their visa extended until 14 April 2024. The Department of Home Affairs directly notified eligible visa holders of the extension of their visa to facilitate their travel. Further details related to this visa concession is available on the Department's Skilled- Recognised Graduate visa website at: https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting- a-visa/visa-listing/skilled-recognition-graduate-476.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Migration Strategy released on 11 December 2023 outlined the Australian Government's vision for getting migration working for the nation and building a migration system that delivers for workers, businesses and all Australians. The strategy highlighted that there were multiple and confusing graduate visa products and confirmed that the Skilled-Recognised Graduate visa no longer aligns with policy priorities. The visa was subsequently capped on 22 December 2023, and permanently closed to new applications from 1 July 2024.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence, originally directed to the Minister for Government Services, the Hon Bill Shorten MP concerning Petition EN4607 on myGovID.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is delivering simple, secure and connected public services for all Australians through world class data and digital capabilities. Central to this are the myGov and myGovID services administered by Services Australia, the Australian Taxation Office and Digital Transformation Agency.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">MyGov is a voluntary online digital service that is a simple and secure way for Australians to access and communicate with a range of government services, including the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), in one place. MyGovID is a whole-of-government digital identity (ID) solution which can be used by Australians via the myGovID application to prove who they are online. It allows users to confirm their identity only once, which can then be re-used to access participating government online services, saving users time and removing the inconvenience of having to constantly prove their identity with every interaction.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">MyGovID's role is that of an accredited Identity provider (ldP) within the Australian Government's Digital ID System (AGDIS). An IdP's role is to help individuals set up and manage their digital ID so they can prove who they are online. More than 12 million myGovIDs have been created that can be used to access more than 140 government services across Commonwealth, states, and territories.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">MyGovID is a voluntary service and does not have any bearing on access or eligibility requirements for applying or receiving Government rebates, entitlements or refunds. Such requirements are established by law and administered in accordance with the law by the relevant government agency. No Australian individual or business is denied access to government assistance or a legal entitlement because they do not have myGov or myGovID. If users are having difficulty creating a myGovID or using the service to access support or information, they can access guidance material and contact details from the myGovID website—mygovid.gov.au.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN4978 regarding the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 20 April 2023, the Albanese Government released the findings of the first external review of the RBA and the operation of monetary policy since current arrangements were instituted in the early 1990s. The Review found that Australia's monetary policy framework has contributed to good economic outcomes in</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia over the past three decades but identified opportunities to strengthen it. One recommendation of the Review is to conduct 5-yearly reviews of the RBA's monetary policy framework and tools to ensure the RBA's approach remains appropriate into the future. The Government is working to implement the Review's recommendations. The Government implemented some of the recommendations last year through an updated agreement with the RBA and currently has legislation before Parliament.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We acknowledge that higher interest rates have been very challenging for Australians who are already doing it tough. Households are under pressure from higher costs of living, and higher interest rates have added further pressure.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government does not intervene in the decisions taken by the independent RBA, which aims to keep inflation between 2 and 3 per cent a year. The Government agrees with the RBA that inflation remains a key challenge in our economy. The Government's economic plan is focused on fighting inflation in our economy and providing responsible cost of living relief.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's tax cuts for all Australian taxpayers commenced on 1 July 2024. To ease pressure on low- and middle-income Australian households, changes made by the Government are delivering bigger tax cuts for them in a way that does not add to the inflation outlook. The Government also increased the Medicare levy low-income thresholds for singles, families, seniors and pensioners from 1 July 2023.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is also delivering cost-of-living relief to help ease pressure on households and businesses. The 2024-25 Budget delivered further cost-of-living relief, including energy bill relief for all households and eligible small businesses, further increasing Commonwealth Rent Assistance, making medicines cheaper, and reducing student debt.</span>

As part of this package, all levels of government have agreed to implement a 9-point plan that includes:</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">This represents an investment of $1.9 billion over five years from 2023-24, and builds on the Government's 15 per cent increase to CRA maximum rates in the last Budget. These are the first back-to-back increases in rent assistance in over 30 years.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government does not support rent freezes. There is strong consensus in academic literature on the negative impacts of rent freezes as they reduce both the quantity and quality of housing available in the market, making it harder for tenants to secure housing that meets their needs. The Government's response to the Senate Rental Inquiry on the worsening rental crisis in Australia, tabled on 14 May 2024, emphasises the most effective way to sustainably improve rental affordability is to increase housing supply and refers to the Government's housing agenda to demonstrate work already underway to address concerns raised by the recommendations.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 1 July 2024, to the former Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator the Hon Murray Watt, concerning petition number EN6241. I apologise for the delay in my response.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Labor Government took this policy to the 2019 and 2022 elections, and we are providing certainty, time and support to navigate this important transition.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">In July 2024, both houses of the Federal Parliament agreed to ban live sheep exports by sea from 1 May 2028. This brings Australia's laws in line with community expectations in relation to sheep welfare and delivers on our election commitment.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Parliament passing legislation provides certainty for the live sheep export industry to make decisions for the future by providing a clear end date of 1 May 2028 and it enables the delivery of a transition assistance package.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">We understand that this change will have impacts on the sector, and we have committed $139.7 million over five years to assist affected sheep farmers, businesses in the supply chain and communities to plan for and adapt to the phase out.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This includes $97.3 million of funding specifically allocated to assist sheep producers and supply chain businesses to transition away from live sheep exports by sea and take advantage of the rapidly growing demand for sheepmeat, currently valued at around $4.5 billion a year.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The transition assistance package also includes funding of $27 million to increase market demand, explore market development opportunities and advocate for Australian products at home and overseas. This will help to ensure participants in the supply chain are supported to capitalise on emerging opportunities and are well positioned when the trade ends.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for you correspondence of 12 August 2024, enclosing Petition EN6312, with 186 signatures, concerning migration options for pharmacists. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to supporting Australia's healthcare sector through skilled migration. Healthcare occupations are prioritised in the skilled migration program, which means faster processing of skilled visas for healthcare workers, including pharmacists. Under the 2023-24 permanent Migration Program, 16,572 places were delivered to primary applicants in healthcare occupations, 822 of which were in pharmacy occupations. Most of these places were delivered under state and territory nominated visa categories.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition calls for an increase to state and territory visa allocations. State and territory nominated migration programs allow each jurisdiction to nominate visa applicants with skills and occupations that meet their specific labour market needs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For 2024-25, the Government has increased the planning levels for the State and Territory Nominated category to 33,000 visas and the Regional category (which largely consist of state and territory nominated places) to 33,000 visas. This is an additional 3,300 places for these program. Increasing the planning levels has also allowed the Government to increase, by 57 per cent, the number of prospective applicants that jurisdictions can nominate in these visa programs. This means that there is now greater opportunity for State and Territory Governments to nominate pharmacists for a visa and for these applicants to be granted a visa under the Migration Program.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's Migration Strategy also outlines steps the Government is taking to simplify the migration system for migrants and employers. This includes creating a new Skills in Demand visa with clear pathways to permanent residence and streamlined labour market testing requirements to reduce complexity.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australian employers, including pharmacies, can find detailed information on how to navigate the process for sponsoring overseas workers on the Department of Home Affairs' website at: https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/employing-and-sponsoring- someone/employing-overseas-workers.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government appreciates licensees are the lifeblood of communities and play a crucial role in ensuring ongoing access to postal and other essential services across Australia. The Government remains committed to helping Australia Post adapt to the digitisation of the economy so that it remains a cherished national institution, providing essential services to Australian communities.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 12 August 2024 to the Hon Michelle Rowland MP, Minister for Communications, concerning Petition EN6356. As the issues raised in this petition fall within my portfolio 1:esponsibilities as the Attorney-General, the petition was referred to me for a response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government acknowledges the concerns around the use of personal information on social media to train AI models. It is vital that Australia's privacy laws properly protect Australians' personal information, and that they keep pace with technological developments and global standards.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Privacy Act 1988 </span>(Privacy Act) protects the privacy of Australians by regulating the collection, use, disclosure and storage of personal information. It contains the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) which apply to Australian Government agencies and private sector organisations with an annual turnover of over $3 million. APP 6 provides that where personal information has been collected for a primary purpose, it must not be used for a secondary purpose unless the individual has consented or an exception applies. One of the exceptions is where the individual would 'reasonably expect' the information to be used for the secondary purpose. However, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner has recently released guidance stating that organisations seeking to rely on this exception should <span style="font-style:italic;">only do so </span>where they can: show that <span style="font-style:italic;">a reasonable person who is properly informed </span>would expect their information to be used in this way.<span style="font-style:italic;">[1]</span></span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to strengthening privacy protections to provide Australians with more choice and control over their information. The Attorney-General's Department's comprehensive review of the Privacy Act was released in February 2023. The Government's Response to this review was published in September 2023 and is available online at https://www.ag.gov.au/rights-and-protections/publications/government-response-privacy- act-review-report.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In this response, the Government agreed or agreed in-principle to progress the vast majority of proposals to amend the Privacy Act, including reforms to ensure that consent, where provided, is meaningful and that collection, use and disclose of personal information is 'fair and reasonable' in the circumstances. This proposal would require entities to handle personal information in a way which Australians would reasonably expect, regardless of whether consent had been provided.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Additional proposals that the Government has agreed or agreed in-principle include requiring entities to be more transparent about how they handle personal information and providing individuals with a right to have their personal information erased.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 12 September 2024, I introduced the Privacy and Other Legislation Bill 2024 into the Parliament. The Bill would legislate a first tranche of privacy reforms and introduce a new statutory tort for serious invasions of privacy and new offences targeting the release of personal data in a manner that would be menacing or harassing.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will continue to progress the remaining proposals to which we agreed in principle in our Response to the Privacy Act Review. This will involve targeted consultation on draft provisions to inform the Government's decisions on next steps and a future package of reforms.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 8 October 2024 to the Minister for Social Services, the Hon Amanda Rishworth MP, concerning petition EN6437—Calling for Clare's Law to be implemented nationally. The Minister has asked me to respond on her behalf.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge the concerns identified in this petition and thank those who participated for raising this matter with the Australian Government.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under Australia's federal system of government, the primary responsibility for criminal matters rests with the states and territories, with each jurisdiction managing their own justice systems and law enforcement agencies. As such, the establishment of a Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme (DVDS) is a matter for the states and territories.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">However, the Government is dedicated to strengthening justice responses to keep women and children safe from violence. The National Domestic Violence Order Scheme (NDVOS) has been in place since 2017. It seeks to ensure protections for Domestic Violence Orders (DVOs) are recognised and enforced across Australia. The NDVOS is a model law statutory scheme under which jurisdictions automatically recognise and enforce one another's DVOs. It is currently underpinned by an interim information-sharing solution that leverages the National Police Reference System (managed by the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission) to provide police and courts with information on DVOs issued across Australia. The NDVOS helps to improve police situational awareness when responding to domestic violence incidents, improving both victim and police safety, and ensures local courts can recognise, amend and otherwise effectively deal with DVO, even if issued interstate.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, the Government has made women's safety a national priority through the development and implementation of the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children 2022-32 </span>(the National Plan).</span>

Over the past 3 federal Budgets, the Government has committed more than $3.4 billion towards implementation of the National Plan.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 8 October 2024 enclosing Petition EN6443, with 109 signatures, concerning permanent visa pathways for temporary visa holders who have contributed to the Australian economy during the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 27 April 2023, the Government committed to provide a pathway to permanent residence for all temporary skilled visa holders. This has now occurred following a number of regulatory changes in November 2023. This pathway is in addition to existing pathways that help maintain Australia as a destination of choice for skilled migrants. The pathway also helps restore permanency at the heart of Australia's skilled migration system as all temporary skilled migrant workers will now have a clear pathway to permanent residency.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Graduate visas are available to former student visa holders. The visa provides full work rights and allows international students to gain work experience in Australia's labour market after finishing their studies. The Government is also strengthening the pathway from graduate visas to temporary skilled visas to give employers more certainty about a graduate's ongoing work rights and pathways to permanent residence.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Each humanitarian crisis is different, and the Government responds according to the relevant needs at the time.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to the mental health system reform to improve access and equity in mental health care and recognises this involves considering a range of models of care, types oftreatment and a diverse and highly skilled workforce. To meet the needs of Australians at various life stages and in a range of settings, the Government recognises the importance of strengthening coordinated care, collaboration, and multidisciplinary ways of working. This includes ensuring people have access to the right mix of mental health initiatives and clinical and non-clinical services to address their mental and physical health needs whilst ensuring safety and quality of care.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I take on the role as Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs with a deep sense of responsibility and resolve. Australia is a multicultural nation where its first priority should be how we can focus on inclusion and bringing people together.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Migration is a critical part of Australia's social and financial development as a nation. Immigration provides our businesses with the skills they need, stimulates demand for goods and services, and increases our economic output. I am committed to maintaining strong borders and delivering an orderly and compassionate immigration strategy that is tailored to the needs of the nation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government released the Migration Strategy (the Strategy) in December last year. A key objective of the Strategy is building stronger Australian communities by better planning the migration intake. This will better connect skilled migrants to Australia's skill needs, helping to reignite productivity growth, which will ensure rising living standards, business growth and better wages. Student visa reforms in the Strategy will restore integrity and quality to the system, and ensure international students are not being exploited.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Strategy includes a number of measures to return Net Overseas Migration to pre-pandemic levels, allowing Government to manage migration levels while also ensuring the Migration Program is focused on getting the right skills in the right places.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In respect of impact on housing, around 60 percent of visas under the permanent Migration Program are granted to migrants already onshore and in the community, residing in established households at the time of visa grant. This minimises the permanent Migration Program's near-term impact on housing, infrastructure and services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is also working to address housing shortages through significant investment in the Homes for Australia Plan, which aims to build 1.2 million new homes from 1 July 2024.

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 22 October 2024 to the Minister for Social Services, the Hon Amanda Rishworth MP, concerning Petition EN6498—Demand Transparency and Fairness in Institutional Abuse Redress (the petition). The Minister has asked me to respond to you on her behalf.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note the petition makes several recommendations to improve the operation of the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse (the Scheme). I have addressed the petition's specific recommendations as follows.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Scheme was established in 2018 and is a joint response by the Australian Government, in partnership with each state and territory government, to the recommendations of the Royal</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse's (Royal Commission) Redress and Civil Litigation Report. This is because governments agreed with the Royal Commission's recommendation that "the best structure for providing redress is through a single national redress scheme established by the Government".</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Scheme is structured such that participating governments and non-government institutions may be held liable for abuse and required to pay redress. While the Scheme provides only one payment, it is designed to reflect the breadth of potential liability of these participating jurisdictions and institutions depending on a survivor's individual experience of abuse.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Scheme provides funding to a free and independent legal service called knowmore Legal Services (knowmore) to provide free legal advice and practical assistance for survivors of child sexual abuse, including support to prepare and submit an application to the Scheme.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is a person's choice whether they seek free legal support through knowmore or engage a private legal firm to assist with their redress application, noting that the fees for engaging a private legal firm will not be reimbursed or otherwise paid for by the Scheme.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Scheme is aware of instances where the cost of private legal fees has been unreasonably high and were deducted directly from survivors' redress payments without the survivor's understanding. The Scheme is actively working with state and territory peak legal bodies to educate the broader legal community about the redress scheme in an attempt to dissuade such predatory practices from occurring.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For completeness, I advise that it is also open to a person to seek support through the redress application process from a Redress Support Services at www.nationalredress.gov.au/help- support.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Scheme is aware of predatory practices within some sections of the legal community seeking to exploit and profit from victims of child sexual abuse. This includes claim farming, which involves an individual or organisation targeting a person and pressuring them to make a redress application. People or firms operating in this way benefit from the survivor submitting a claim through their service by charging commission or high legal fees for their assistance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Ministers' Redress Scheme Governance Board continues to monitor these and related issues, including engaging with the Australian Law Reform Commission on actions that can be taken to address these issues. Queensland has implemented legislation to curb claim farming in an effort to protect the community from these predatory practices. The Scheme understands other jurisdictions are contemplating similar legislation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Scheme provides payments of up to $150,000 maximum in recognition of abuse experienced. While this amount is less than the maximum $200,000 payment recommended by the Royal Commission, the average redress payment amount paid by the Scheme is approximately $90,000, which is more than $20,000 higher than the $66,000 average payment amount contemplated by the Royal Commission.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Scheme has recently made a number of changes to support even greater access to redress for survivors. This includes:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      21.3pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">removing the restriction on people applying from gaol;</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      21.3pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">the option of having a finalised application reassessed where a relevant institution subsequently joins the Scheme or a government agrees to be the Funder of Last Resort; and</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      21.3pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">allowing additional information with a review request and introducing a 'no worse off provision so reviewed offers are not reduced by a differing interpretation of the application.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, per recommendation 3.11 of the Second Anniversary Review, the Scheme has made changes to the Assessment Framework to combine the recognition of impact of sexual abuse payment with the recognition of sexual abuse payment. This means that all eligible applicants to the Scheme will receive the recognition of sexual abuse and recognition of impact of sexual abuse payment. These payments combined come to a minimum redress payment of $10,000 ensuring all redress outcomes will expressly recognise the impact of the abuse that a person experienced.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I recognise that the petition further requests that the Australian, state and territory governments launch an investigation into the aforementioned matters immediately. I advise the Scheme is already subject to parliamentary scrutiny in the form of the Joint Standing Committee on Implementation of the National Redress Scheme (Committee).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee is currently conducting an inquiry into the Scheme which covers a wide range of issues, including some raised in this petition. I understand the Committee may be releasing its report shortly.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further, in addition to the Second Year Review of the Scheme conducted by Ms Robyn Kruk AO in June 2021, there is a legislative requirement under section 192(3) of the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Act 2018, </span>that the Minister responsible for the Scheme must cause a review into its operation to commence as soon as possible after the 8th anniversary of the Scheme's start day, being 1 July 2026. The 'eight-year review' of the Scheme will provide a further opportunity for review and comment into the operation of the Scheme.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In light of the current and future inquiries, the Minister will not be recommending that the Government pursue further investigations into the Scheme at this time.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust that this information is of assistance to you. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Yours sincerely</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 8 October 2024 enclosing Petition EN6544, with 185 signatures, concerning residency for farm workers who supported agriculture during COVID-19.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Migration is a critical part of Australia's social and financial development as a nation. Immigration provides our businesses, including the agriculture sector, with the skills they need, stimulates demand for goods and services and increases our economic output. I am committed to delivering an orderly and compassionate immigration strategy that is tailored to the needs of the nation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Skilled migrants play an important role in nation building, cultural diversity and social cohesion, as well as contributing significant economic benefits. The Skilled visa programs are designed to ensure that overseas workers supplement but do not displace Australian workers. Australia's universal, non-discriminatory migration programs are designed to support a safe, prosperous and united Australia.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">You may be aware that on 11 December 2023 the Government released the Migration Strategy, which was developed to deliver a better managed and more targeted migration system. On 25 November 2023, as part of these reforms, the Government provided a simpler and clearer pathway to permanent residence for all Temporary Skill Shortage (TSS) visa holders, including:</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 12 September 2024 enclosing Petition PN0613, with 706 signatures, concerning the resettlement of refugees from Indonesia. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has a long history of providing resettlement for refugees and others who are displaced as a result of conflict, persecution and human rights abuses. Since the end of World War II, Australia has successfully settled more than 950,000 refugees and others in humanitarian needs.</span>

The Government has allocated 20,000 places in Australia's 2024-25 Humanitarian Program, and is committed to delivering these places in full.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Our generous Humanitarian Program continues to provide lawful pathways to Australia to refugees and others in humanitarian need, which helps to stabilise refugee populations, reduces the prospect of irregular movement from source countries and countries of first asylum, and supports broader international protection objectives.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge the world is currently experiencing the greatest level of humanitarian need in history, and as the Minister for Immigration, I am mindful to ensure our Humanitarian Program continues to respond to crisis around the world as they arise. The Australian Government has established policy to guide decisions on which applications are given priority. More detail on the Humanitarian Program can be found at https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/what-we-do/refugee-and-humanitarian-program/about- the-program/about-the-program and humanitarian program (homeaffairs.gov.au).</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">This petition raises concerns regarding the cohort of refugees in Indonesia. In addition to the Humanitarian and Settlement Program, Australia is committed to working with Indonesia to manage irregular migration in Indonesia, including through a Regional Cooperation Agreement (RCA). The RCA, which is administered by the International Organization for Migration, supports the Government of Indonesia's management of refugees and asylum seekers population across Indonesia. The RCA assists approximately 5,500 refugees and asylum seekers who registered with United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Indonesia before 31 March 2018, while they await resettlement outcomes through the UNHCR.</span>

                  </span>There are only paper petitions for presentation today, as no electronic petitions have closed for signature since last week's report. One of these petitions relates to child labour in the chocolate supply chain. Another relates to Falun Gong practitioners in China, and the third relates to Australia's greenhouse gas emission reduction targets and has more than 2½ thousand signatures. The principal petitioner, Dylan McCarthy, is a high school student from Wentworth Falls in my electorate of Macquarie. I met with Dylan before this sitting fortnight to receive the petition he's been gathering signatures for all year as part of a school project. It's been the result of many hours, and days, of work to disseminate the petition and gather signatures. Like so many young Blue Mountains residents, he's backing strong action on climate change, and I'm very pleased to be presenting this petition.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the rise and convenience of electronic petitioning, it's not surprising that paper petitions now make up a small minority of petitions to this House. Nevertheless, they provide a unique quality. The paper often bears physical marks of the act of grassroots petitioning. Some pages may be well-worn after passing through numerous hands or after being attached to a clipboard. There are often many ink types on a page, and, of course, there is a multitude of handwriting styles. Some petitions appear to have been created by, or signed by, children. This is completely legitimate, as there is no age limit to petition this House. The paper petition remains a tangible and important element of our petitioning system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Being the last sitting week scheduled for 2024, I thank my fellow committee members for their work considering petitions and facilitating the petitions process. I also thank ministers for the responses provided to petitions during the year. And, of course, I thank the secretariat, who assists us so ably in our work. After this week, the committee will look forward to 2025, when we will consider further petitions and responses that will have come in over the break in sittings.</span>

It is a great honour to be able to second this resolution. I do not hope to do justice to it as much as did the previous speaker. It was one of the better addresses that I've heard in this parliament.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having said that, I will say that for seven years of my life I carried around in my briefcase that I take everywhere with me the names of six overseas doctors because, as the member of parliament for Queensland's mid-west, I was determined that Julia Creek would always have a doctor. Before I went into parliament it never had a doctor. In theory it was supposed to have one, but the doctor never made it there. Then they brought in another doctor to go there. He'd agreed to go, but then he wouldn't. So I carried around the names of these overseas doctors that I could ring up who would come over to Australia and take up the position if it was offered to them.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What overcame that problem was one of the great ladies of Australian history, Lady Pearl Logan, who gave us equal educational opportunities in country areas. But she was also chairman of the body—my daughter, who was secretary of the body, got all the praise, and I think Professor Ian Ronski was the real driver—that got the first medical school built in Australia in 44 years. That dramatically overcame the problem, because 18 universities then walked through the door that we were able to open. The sandstone universities didn't want any competition. They wouldn't expand, so for about 20 years we just sat there with the same number of doctors coming out. But now there are 18 universities. I listened in horror to my colleague from Orange giving those figures. Why hasn't it solved the problem? When they get through now, in a study that I've seen, they feel that they should take it easy or get a government job, which will be more highly paid than any other. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Research from the Foundation for Social Health shows that the emergence of social media correlates with young Australians now being the loneliest cohort in our society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Previously, it was the over 60s who topped the stats on social isolation, but now it's apparently our most connected generation that feels most disconnected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ninety-one per cent of participants in the millennial and gen Z generational cohorts reported that social media has taken away from their real-life interaction with friends, family and community in some way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Human society has long had a dual relationship with technology. New inventions—particularly those with the potential for transformational change—have carried an inherent but invisible framework of risk and reward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And since the emergence of social media, we have failed to manage that risk. Now, we're faced with the challenge of retrofitting rules onto enormously powerful societal influencers—the companies that run these platforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And I would argue that we should do that not with bandaid measures but with an approach that manages the whole environment where the harm is taking place—and puts the responsibility on the platforms not the users.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last decade or two, as social media and big tech have entrenched their practices and business models, governments—like the former coalition government—have designed 'content' based take-down regulatory models like those previously designed for broadcast media.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It makes sense—broadcast something that doesn't meet community standards—remove it or don't do it again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But of course those legacy media environments didn't have the algorithm to spread content like wildfire the way information moves on social media now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In lieu of a better idea, it's understandable that governments returned to what used to work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And when the former government enacted the Online Safety Act, it was world leading in its ability to combat the spread of harmful content. There was, to put it bluntly, no better idea.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But now there is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Online Safety Amendment (Digital Duty of Care) Bill, like the European Digital Services Act and UK's Online Safety Act, is modelled off of the groundbreaking work of Professor Lorna Woods and a four-year project from Carnegie UK Trust.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Core to this model, now implemented in the EU and UK, are five interoperating key elements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And the core aim—to make the platforms make their spaces safe for us, for our kids, for our communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First, the bill implements a singular and overarching statutory duty of care required by digital platforms for the wellbeing of their Australian users.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A duty of care is not only just but essential. It is appropriately broad in scope to ensure that all of the systems, processes and elements of a digital service are captured, including 'dark patterns' and addictive design features.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now I've been talking about this for some time, and I acknowledge that the government is gradually signalling its intent to move in this direction eventually.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But a duty of care isn't enough on its own. It must be given teeth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Second and third therefore, the bill frames a complementary scheme of risk assessments and risk mitigation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Platforms will be regularly required to assess for the risk that their algorithms and other digital systems could have on mental health, the rights of the child, gender based violence and electoral processes, for example.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Platforms will also be required to prepare an accompanying mitigation plan which demonstrates to the government and the people exactly how they will reprogram or change their algorithms and systems to prevent these risks in the first instance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is how we make social media safe by design.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Without pressuring digital platforms to make all of their algorithms and systems progressively safer over time, governments around the world will continue to resort to handbrake measures, such as age based prohibition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Age gating will not make platforms safer. It will maintain the situation where safety is the responsibility of the user—including parents and children—and indeed it may have the unintended consequence of further socially isolating some young people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Far better, surely, than attempting to lock young people out (without even knowing if or how that can work), to make the space safe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourth, and critically, the bill imposes mandatory transparency measures to ensure the government and public understand and can monitor how algorithmic systems are functioning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This involves mandatory data access for public-interest research, and regular transparency reporting on key metrics, such as usage statistics and quantitative data on exposure of children to harmful content.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fifth, this regime must be backed up with enforceability. Digital platforms under this bill will be liable for civil penalties of up to 10 per cent of annual turnover for noncompliance, and their senior management with penalties consistent with securities fraud.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And the bill will require platforms to enable people to reset and switch off the algorithm if they so choose and require the strongest privacy settings by default.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the work of my expert and lived experience Eating Disorders Working Group, which in many ways has been the starting point for my work in this space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no silver bullet for online safety. But this five-element regulatory framework is demonstrably effective, and has become the international best practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend this bill to the House—because Australia can once again become a world leader in online safety. In the words of Professor Lorna Woods, 'We need a response that is preventative, not palliative.'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Humans designed these systems. And so, where we must, we can redesign them to serve our collective needs, rather than those of Mr Zuckerberg and Mr Musk.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:19</span>):  I second the motion. Social media has transformed how humans spend their time and how we communicate. The online world is, for many young people, a preferred place to access information, to build social and technical skills, to connect with our families and friends, to learn about the world, to relax and to play. These opportunities are really important in the transition to adulthood, but social media has well documented and significant risks for children and young people. These risks do need to be addressed by government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent months both major political parties in Australia have rushed to ban social media access for young people. Their proposals are broad in scope but short on detail. They abdicate all responsibility to digital providers. They are not evidence based, they risk being utterly ineffectual and they risk potentially significant unintended consequences. The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">National policies should be aimed at providing children with the opportunity to benefit from engaging with the digital environment and ensuring their safe access to it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whether bans are practically possible remains debatable. There are significant concerns regarding privacy, data and consent. Bans could well create more risk for children who still use platforms, because they will remove the incentives to ensure robust child safety features for those younger users who evade age assurance measures. Bans will not improve those products which children will still be allowed to use.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the problem here? The fact that we in this country allow billion-dollar companies to market unsafe digital products, or the fact that some of the people who use those products are teenagers? Experts have suggested that we should look at more targeted interventions rather than rushing to poorly considered, technically challenging blanket bans on social media access. Systemic regulation can drive up safety and privacy standards on all platforms for all children, and this approach has been supported by expert groups in mental health, digital literacy and child psychology.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For that reason, I am happy to support the member for Goldstein's proposal to amend the Online Safety Act to impose an overarching standard of care for large providers. This will mandate risk assessments and risk mitigation plans, mandatory transparency and reporting, and stringent enforcement mechanisms. It will protect our children. Something worth doing is worth doing well, in an evidence-balanced way. If the government accepts this bill today, we will start protecting young children immediately. I commend it to the House.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we stand here in this chamber today, once again we're debating an issue that the government has failed to address. We see, each and every day, Australia's need for more building and construction workers. We know that there are not enough workers joining the industry each year to keep up with demand, and this is putting significant pressure on the workforce at a time when Australia is experiencing a housing and construction crisis. In its September 2024 report <span style="font-style:italic;">The future of the workforce: the building and construction industry</span>, Master Builders Australia reported that since 2022 there has been a 14.7 per cent decrease in the number of construction industry apprentices completing their studies, and the total number of construction apprentices has decreased by some 22½ per cent for the same period. We all know that, to be able to keep up with current and future demand, the industry needs net growth of around 10 per cent per annum over the next five years. That's about 130,000 people who need to join the building and construction workforce. The Master Builders Australia report goes on to say that two of the key things they see that could happen to facilitate this would be simplifying the process by which skilled migrants can apply for a visa and including migrants skilled in the building and construction industry on the Core Skills Occupation List. Jobs and Schools Australia also noted that the replacement rate for construction related occupations is amongst the lowest in the labour market and has declined significantly, to 54 per cent in the 2020-21 financial year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear the government talk a good game, but once again this Labor government is failing Australian businesses and the construction sector. When the National Housing Accord goal was announced, the Labor government pledged an additional contribution of $15,000 for each home built beyond one million homes, but Australia has never delivered 1.2 million homes in any five-year period. The closest was in 2014 under the then Abbott government, when a total of 1.1 million new dwellings were commenced. We have seen this government also preside over a business insolvency crisis across the construction industry, with nearly 6,400 construction business insolvencies in its term of government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These insolvencies and the continued workforce shortages in the building and construction workforce result in nearly 73,000 fewer workers and the loss of some 13,000 new home buildings, a decrease in building construction output totalling some $7.7 billion and a $57 billion reduction in GDP. Masters Builders Australia recently released an analysis showing the latest build times. It found that 15 years ago it took an average of nine months to build a standalone home. This has blown out to 12 months, an increase of over 40 per cent, making it even more difficult to meet the government's ambitious housing targets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In comparison, a coalition government would strongly focus on skills funding would but also ensure that students have a choice because we have seen with the government's free TAFE bill that students don't have a choice because they support only one section of the skills and training industry. We know, from the statistics, that students in the private sector have a better outcome in terms of jobs and skills and training, so why is the government only picking one sector of the training industry to support, not the whole industry? In addition, our housing infrastructure program seeks to support workers on the ground by assisting in the infrastructure that housing needs—water, power, sewerage and access roads. We're not limiting the policy just to housing. It's much broader than that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, Australians deserve the sound economic management that a coalition government would deliver, not the economic mismanagement that this Labor government is inflicting on Australians each and every day.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:31</span>):  I'll start by saying this motion does get one thing right: there is currently a workforce shortage in Australia. And not just in the building and construction industry, but across a multitude of sectors in this country. It needs to be addressed. But where the words in front of us this morning fall short is on how we should act to fix the issue. The coalition's ideas that they put forward in this motion alongside their actions in this place to actually address the workforce shortage range from non-existent to nonsensical. I'm happy to explain why.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion connects the workforce shortage Australia currently faces with cost-of-living pressures that are especially hurting people in my community. It connects the skills gap, another urgent issue in Spence, with the housing crisis playing out each and every day in our communities. It does those things and then passes the buck over to our side of the chamber so that those opposite can safely escape responsibility, as if nine long years of sheer sitting-on-hands neglect, which we have been cleaning up, never occurred under the watch of a Liberal government. It's as if those opposite weren't completely ignoring housing affordability in this country, not even having a housing minister for most of that time while Aussies gradually began to struggle more and more. It's as if the coalition didn't rip $3 billion out of TAFE over the course of their reign to help create this shortage we're seeing today. I'm at least used to that by now. It wouldn't be a day in this place without this opposition creating an issue and then using it to profit off the people losing out as a result.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let's, for a moment, let all that slide. Let's give the opposition the fresh start that they so desperately crave. Let's say we've given them that, a blank canvas to escape their actions. What do we get in return? We get a motion like this, not even a week after the Liberals decided to attack fee-free TAFE and those opposite let slip that their key principles include holding people back from accessing tertiary education to learn skills to enter the workforce. I honestly couldn't make it up. The opposition have taken the time this morning to call attention to workforce shortages, to pass the buck on their own failures, to escape their role in helping Aussies fight the cost of living while at the same time they actively work against getting people into the workforce, they try to stop Aussies from earning a living, and they try to make it harder for Aussies to access TAFE to learn the skills they need to work and build homes to solve the issues they're raising. Make it make sense! The Labor government has introduced a free program that has seen half a million enrolments into TAFE, to do what's needed to solve the issues in this motion. The Liberals are against it because it's free and because it addresses workforce shortages in a way that's affordable for people. What a joke!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's such a shame, especially for communities across the northern suburbs of Adelaide. The north has been built on the success of a healthy intergenerational workforce, built on the people with blue denim in their veins, as our community's very own Jimmy Barnes would point out. This journey goes all the way back to Holdens and their transformative presence in Elizabeth through the decades, all the way through to the thriving business park of Lionsgate, which we see on the same site today, and everywhere in between. Large companies, like BAE Systems, are achieving incredible things with some fantastic local apprentices. More modest businesses, such as Mr Dapy's Demolition in Smithfield, continue to innovate alongside the services they provide. These examples alongside countless others, throughout the history of our community, make up the unique story of the north and that's a story that continues today, as livelihoods are made and communities are built off the back of a thriving workforce. This is why it's imperative this shortage is addressed. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our workforce is the lifeblood of our community—both then and now. It's through their wellbeing that we fight hardest against the cost of living. It's through their training and skills that Australia will meet the challenge of the housing crisis. It's through motions like this one, that squeezes pure snake oil out of people already doing it tough, that this workforce, their communities and their nation will continue to be held back. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr YOUNG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:36</span>):  I rise today to speak on the motion moved by the member for Forde. In this country, we have a housing shortage. There are many factors we need to fix to alleviate this problem and to get Australians into their own homes, to rekindle that great Australian dream of homeownership that, for many, has become the great Australian nightmare under this Labor government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One issue that must be addressed is the tradie shortage, not only in the building and construction industry but across many sectors. When I speak to owners of small and medium-sized businesses, one of the major issues they cite is a lack of skilled workers that are suitable for the job vacancies they have. Much of this issue has been created over decades, with pressure from governments, society and parents encouraging university education. I've got no problem with university education; we need it. We need doctors, physiotherapists, teachers, nurses and the like but not at the expense of plumbers, hairdressers, chippies, and retail and hospitality workers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I cannot count the number of parents and young people who have felt pressured or guilted into taking on a university degree, even though university wasn't something they had a great interest in. I spoke to a young man recently who had done two years, reluctantly, at university after feeling pressured by well-meaning staff at school and his parents to enter university. He spoke to me of his depression and feelings of failure as he simply could not cope with the academic demands of higher education. Frustrated, he finally left and for the past 12 months he's started a small business doing bond cleaning for real estate. He is now earning a good income, and, more importantly, he is as happy as a pig in mud. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">BuildSkills Australia, the national Jobs and Skills Council for the construction sector, informs us that Australia needs to urgently find an extra 90,000 skilled tradespeople to meet Labor's housing targets and that our construction industry faces a workforce shortfall of 40 per cent by 2040. This point was conceded by the housing minister, Clare O'Neil, at the recent Australian Financial Review Property Summit in September. Ironically, as home affairs minister previous to her current portfolio, she had the authority to make evidence based policy decisions. Instead, the exact opposite decision was made, excluding tradies from the specialist skills pathway, which is the highest priority visa. Simply put, she put tradies at the bottom of the pile. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The normal practice of the headline announcement with no substance has been part of this issue. The fee-free TAFE initiative sounds good in theory, but the data reveals a different story. First of all, nothing is free. Someone always pays. In this case, that is the taxpayer. The Australian government is simply a steward of the taxpayers' money. It is incumbent on us to ensure they are getting the best bang for their buck. Only 13 per cent of students who enrol in fee-free TAFE actually graduate, and I note here that, in contrast, the completion rate in private RTOs is over 80 per cent. So I ask the question: where should the government be directing funds—to an organisation that turns a 13 per cent completion rate or one that returns an 80 per cent completion rate? In one of the most damning statistics in Victoria, just one per cent of those who registered for a fee-free TAFE certificate IV in plumbing successfully completed their training. The facts are 80 per cent of Australians who get a skill each year obtain that skill from a RTO other than TAFE, so why no investment when these organisations are producing better outcomes?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor have attacked the coalition, criticising our position—that is, if you don't pay for something you don't value it. For those who have the view that there is little difference between the two major parties, this statement pretty well sums up the difference between the two parties: how dare the Australian people expect a return on their hard-earned tax dollars—sarcastic tone intended? The best measure is how many students who enrol actually get a job in the profession that the taxpayers paid for in their training. You can't even get data on this. I suspect this is to hide the numbers that would leave people aghast.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course TAFE needs to be part of the training sector but, just as public schools are one part of the education mix with independent, Catholic and home-schooling also contributing a vital part of the school education system, private RTOs and employers need to be part of the VET sector and, under this government, they are being neglected. Surely COVID taught us that the 'all eggs in one basket' approach leads to disaster.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of the previous coalition government there were 429,000 apprentices and trainees in training. Since this Labor government took office that has dropped by 85,000, and commencements have dropped to 166,200. It is time to vote the coalition in at the next election and get Australia back on track.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="299174" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAXALE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:41</span>):  Australia's construction industry is the lifeblood of our nation. Construction workers provide the homes that families grow in, the infrastructure that connects our communities and the jobs that underpin livelihoods across the country. The strength and resilience of this industry are critical to our economic prosperity and to ensure all Australians have access to safe and affordable housing. This is why our government has made supporting these sectors a national priority. To build 1.2 million homes we need the workers to do it and that just doesn't happen on its own. From investing in skills and training to tackling the housing crisis with actual policies, not just empty words, we are committed to building a future that delivers for Australia's workers, families and businesses. Our policies are helping to grow the pipeline of skilled workers, creating opportunities for men and women and young Australians, and supporting businesses. A skilled workforce is the backbone of the construction industry. This government is delivering where it matters most, and, unlike those opposite, we are actually doing something about addressing the skills shortage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I go into the policies we have enacted, it is important to paint a picture of the workforce shortage situation when we came to government. When we came to government we inherited the worst skills shortage in half a century after a near decade of fiscal and policy neglect from the Liberals. The OECD said Australia had the second-highest labour shortage per capita among the OECD. So we had to address that near decade of neglect with actual policy and we believe the best way to skill local construction workers is through TAFE.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since its implementation, our free-TAFE policy has seen over half a million people go to TAFE to reskill. It has opened the door to thousands of Australians to gain the qualifications they need to build futures for our nation. Last year alone, over 24,000 people enrolled in construction, and we have announced plans to roll out an additional 20,000 free TAFE and VET places specifically targeting the construction and housing sectors. We are also funding 5,000 new preapprenticeship places, helping aspiring tradies take their first steps into the industry, ensuring they are ready to tackle the challenges of tomorrow, because to build homes we need the workers to do it. It is not just about the numbers; it is about creating an industry that also welcomes talent from all walks of life and that includes empowering women to take their place in the construction industry, a field where they have been historically underrepresented. We have a $61 million program to help women's careers in construction to address the systemic and cultural barriers that have made it harder for women to enter this industry. The results so far are encouraging. Of the 24,000 Aussies who took up construction in TAFE last year, over 3,000 were women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is progress, but we know there's more to do. Empowering women is not just about equality; it's about securing the future of construction itself. If we are to meet the needs of and get more workers into the construction industry, we must harness the potential of every skilled and talented individual.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We inherited the skills shortage crisis. We put in policies to address it. What do you think the Liberals' response has been? Like on most things, they have said no. They refused to back the government's initial free TAFE policy. They refused to support expanded access to new energy apprenticeships. Incredibly, their deputy leader has said TAFE is wasteful spending. Addressing the skills shortage is not wasteful spending because, to address it, you need more than a weak motion in this House like we are debating now; you actually need policies. To help the construction industry you need more than empty words or policies which simply wire-transfer funds directly to developers. We haven't had a single workforce policy from those opposite other than that. There wasn't a single skills policy in the opposition leader's budget reply speech. It's been nearly three years and we haven't heard boo from them about what their plans are.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The contrast between the Liberals and Labor couldn't be more stark on skilling up our young men and women to get into construction. We want more tradies. We want them to build our homes in our cities and our regions. We will address the workforce challenges we inherited with good policy, with free TAFE and with the urgency the country needs to fix the mess the Liberals left us. On this side, we will continue to put up these policies. On that side, they will continue to say no.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300147" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VIOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:46</span>):  Sometimes you feel like you're in a different universe in this place. It's almost like that global pandemic called COVID didn't exist and didn't shut down the world and contribute significantly to and been a primary factor of the skills shortage that we face. It's almost like it was all the coalition, if you listen to the member for Bennelong. Those opposite are very good at selectively quoting statistics and selectively talking about things. We saw it last week in this House in the ministerial statement on the economy. The Treasurer stood at the dispatch box and told all Australians and everyone in the House how lucky they are, how great the economy is going and that we've never had it better. In fact I'll use his own words. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This is the soft landing that we have been planning for and preparing for …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the Treasurer is very happy to claim success. I want to commend the member for Forde, because this motion is important. It gives another example of the reality that Australians are facing compared to the spin of those opposite, particularly the Treasurer, who keeps patting himself on the back for the wonderful job that he is supposedly doing in the Australian economy. The problem with that is that every person I speak to in my community, whether they are business owners or employees, families or community groups, are struggling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To show the disconnect, two weeks ago I was talking to two food bank community organisations, two completely separate groups, and they both talked about the working poor that they are looking after at the moment. One of those organisations is up 400 per cent, yet we have to listen to the Treasurer tell us that this is what he was planning for and that the Australian economy as we feel it today is a success—talk about disconnect!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another disconnect is when we look at insolvencies, because we've seen the highest number of business insolvencies in a financial year—11,053 in the financial year 2023-24—under this government. The worst quarter of business insolvencies on record was 3,331 in the September quarter of 2024. These are the challenges that we face. More businesses are having to become insolvent because of the challenges they face. When we look at the October numbers, the most recent numbers, and we get to construction, 353 construction businesses have become insolvent. In my home state of Victoria, it is 106 businesses. In hospitality, 224 businesses have become insolvent. In Victoria, that's 152 businesses. Organisations like hospitality and construction really are the canary in the coalmine when it comes to the economic challenges we face.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look at construction and the skills shortages and the insolvency crisis that the member for Forde raised, one of the reasons construction has such a significant impact is that it impacts all the way along that supply chain. When a construction business goes under, it is heartbreaking for those people that have paid a deposit to the builder, wanting to get their house built. But, when a construction business, particularly a builder, declares bankruptcy or goes insolvent, there is a whole network, a whole ecosystem of subcontractors—electricians, plumbers, labourers—and hardware stores, which provide the raw materials, that are reliant on that business to pay them once it gets paid through the building contract. When a construction business goes insolvent, there is a line of people, a line of communities, that are impacted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Casey, we are lucky to have the highest number of trades as a percentage of the workforce all through the country. So I've seen the impact firsthand. What has happened, which is continuing to drive costs up and making it hard for businesses to operate, is, instead of working with one, two or maybe three key business partners, an electrician or plumber is now having to try and diversify across more businesses, more project managers, to diversify their risk in case the major builder goes bankrupt. That's adding stress and pressure to those families and to my community. But we have a government that doesn't provide any solutions to those challenges. They just continue to pat themselves on the back and tell the Australian people about the great job they're doing. But no-one in Casey, no-one in our community, is feeling better today than they did 2½ years ago. They've been let down by the Albanese Labor government.</span>

That's a proposition that the federal opposition under the Leader of the Opposition, Peter Dutton, are putting to you—making people pay more for their education to get the skills that our economy needs and that our young Australians and retraining Australians need. They are going to make you pay for that because somehow that's going to help with the cost of living. It's quite an extraordinary position to have.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, the Albanese Labor government is building the workforce required to build Australia's future. We are committed to measures that ensure we have the workforce that we need all around the country and, obviously, most importantly to me, in the Northern Territory, in Darwin and Palmerston. Just as TAFE is a proudly Australian story, it is also a key to a better future and to a whole world of opportunities. It opens doors and gives Australians one of the greatest opportunities they have not just to fulfil their potential but to expand their potential and, in doing so, expand what we're able to produce and achieve in this great nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a homegrown solution to the skills gap that is hampering the business that those opposite purport to want to support. It's also a homegrown solution to the skills gap that is hurting our economy. It is true that the Albanese Labor government has delivered two budget surpluses, when those opposite weren't able to do that in almost a decade. However, we understand that the economy is still under a range of pressures. What we need in our nation, and what we are doing, is getting the balance right by getting TAFE right. It means we'll be better placed to get the future right. That's why our government is taking our commitment to free TAFE a crucial step further by making it permanent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite, as they've finally admitted, don't like fee-free TAFE. They want people to pay for it, and that would put another barrier in front of young Australians who want to enter the workforce and start their working lives. It would put another barrier in front of retraining Australians who want to reskill and retrain to start working in a different industry. That's the danger with those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government, the Albanese government, is committed to working with the states and territories to strengthen the VET sector to ensure it can deliver the quality education that Australians deserve, the education we need to build the Northern Territory's future and our nation's future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite neglected the sector for years—for almost a decade, as I've said—and that has compounded the effects of the COVID pandemic with skills shortages, concerningly, in nationally critical industries. But we are addressing these shortages to ensure that we have the workforce that is needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is delivering fee-free TAFE to address our workforce shortages. Fee-free TAFE has changed the lives of hundreds of thousands of Australians, particularly those in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas, providing cost-of-living relief as well as that pathway to a well-paid, secure job. That's good for families and good for the whole nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also focusing on training for places in areas of high demand, providing access to priority cohorts including those vulnerable constituents that I mentioned. We are supporting students by removing those financial barriers to study. Delivering skills needed to address our workforce shortages is top of mind for our government. We're delivering the workforce that business needs to build Australia for a more secure and more prosperous future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300123" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WARE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:57</span>):  I rise to speak on the motion brought in relation to the workforce shortages that Australia is currently experiencing under this Albanese Labor government. I am not sure if the member for Solomon—I was in the chamber for most of his speech—is speaking on the same motion as I am because the member for Solomon spoke only about the alleged assistance the Albanese Labor government is giving to TAFE. But the VET sector is a lot broader than just TAFE. I'm not sure if the member for Solomon is aware of this. Certainly, on our side, we are very aware of this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to speak about the chronic workforce shortages that are throughout Australia and, particularly, in my electorate of Hughes. They are in four main areas. The free-TAFE legislation that this government, those on that side, spruik constantly is doing nothing to help there. I also note that the member for Solomon made a lot of comments about skills shortages being around for a decade. The last time I looked those on that side were in government. They've been in government for 2½ years and have done nothing to address the chronic workforce shortages. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's start with manufacturing. Following the redistribution, my electorate now includes south-west Sydney which includes a lot of manufacturing, particularly around the Ingleburn and Moorebank areas. I've been out to those factories. The people in those factories have been saying to me that they can't get fitters, they can't get turners and they can't get machinists. They can't get people to actually run their machines. I've heard nobody on that side talk about how they are going to address the chronic skills shortages in the manufacturing industry. Of course, the manufacturing industry actually produces goods that can be used here, and it produces goods that we can sell overseas. But there has been nothing for those people, nothing for the manufacturing industry from this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me turn to construction. This week on the news we've heard, yet again, that a record number of construction companies have gone bust in the last month under this Albanese Labor government. That's a record for my home state of New South Wales, the most populous state in the country and the state that most needs construction companies—because guess what they do? They build houses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that I haven't heard from anyone on that side is a reference to the report from the Master Builders Association which is the subject of this motion. In that report, the Master Builders Association talks about chronic skills shortages throughout the construction industry. We are talking not only about electricians, builders and plumbers; we are talking about roofers—it took me six months to get a roofer—we're talking about tilers and we're talking about bricklayers. These trades are where the chronic workforce shortages are. I know this. I speak to the construction companies in my electorate. About 20 per cent of people in my electorate are employed in the trades. I've said to them, 'In the last 2½ years, what has the Labor government done to address the skills shortages in the construction industry?' They are silent because this government has not done anything to address the chronic skills shortages in the trades in construction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's turn to hospitality. I've got many, many beautiful cafes and restaurants in my electorate of Hughes. Whenever I go into one of them to buy a coffee or have dinner, they all say the same thing: they can't get kitchen hands; they can't get chefs; they can't get baristas; they can't get people to wait on tables. When I say, 'Was it this bad 2½ years ago?' guess what they say? 'No; it has got substantially worse under this Albanese Labor government.' The government does not care about those who work in hospitality and does not care about those who own small businesses in hospitality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So when I stand here and hear those on that side talking about fee-free TAFE, I know that is only one little part of the equation. They may have brought in fee-free TAFE legislation; what they haven't done is address the chronic workforce shortages in all of the trades that have continued and been exacerbated under this government.</span>
              </p>

I also want to thank the member for Newcastle particularly for reading out the names of those 66 Australian women who have died as at today at the hands of violent men. I think what was most poignant about the list that was read out was the age range. I think I heard that the youngest was a teenager and the eldest was a lady of 85. In the middle of all that were at least seven or eight women with names unknown. We can only guess at their stories.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The elimination of violence against women is something I think all of us in this place are absolutely committed to addressing. It is so important that we keep talking about it, because we all often feel completely overwhelmed about how we tackle this problem. As the mother of 18-year-old boys, I've always been very conscious of this issue and very conscious to instil in them whatever I can to ensure that they do not end up as perpetrators. Perpetrators cross all lines in Australia. They have different ages and different socioeconomic backgrounds. It can happen in leafy suburbs; it can happen in remote communities. It does not seem to be, in any way, something where we can simply say, 'Here is a box, and here is the man that fits into that box.' I think that that is at the heart of this problem.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:13</span>):  I'd like to begin by thanking my friend the member for Newcastle for bringing this important motion to the House and for the time that she gave to remembering the 66 women, by name where possible, who have lost their lives over the last 12 months. This is the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, and it's heartbreaking that the statistics are even worse this year than they were last year when we spoke about this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the formidable frontline workers, researchers and survivors who advocate all the time for improved responses and prevention of violence against women in our communities. I recently was able to take the Minister for Women to one of the universities in my electorate to sit and talk to researchers about how we can shift the dial on this terrible issue. The work is going to be challenging. There is no doubt about that. But I think that there is a really good sense of bipartisanship in this chamber today in terms of the commitment that we're all making to women's safety. Family and domestic violence is indiscriminate. It affects people of every age, cultural background, job type and level of education, and it destroys lives. Every life lost is one too many. To be faced with that awful statistic of 66 lives lost already this year, I think, is a really stark reminder of how much work we all have to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is prioritising the elimination of violence against women and children. It has been a priority for us since the day we formed government. In each of our first three budgets, we've invested significant—and, indeed, record—funding for women's safety. Our most recent investments, announced following the second dedicated National Cabinet meeting on gender based violence, brought the figure to $4 billion. Obviously it hasn't eliminated violence against women and children, and we need to be mindful of that, but it has been able to deliver immediate and practical investment to support women and children experiencing violence now by supporting the critically important work of preventing violence and intervening before it escalates and supporting the recovery of victims-survivors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is really significant that one of the first things our government did upon being elected was to introduce 10 days of paid domestic and family violence leave. I will never forget being in the chamber and seeing all of the victims-survivors and advocates who had fought so long and so hard for this sitting in the gallery listening to the stories of women, knowing that this leave will save lives. It isn't every day that we recognise that what we do has an immediate effect of saving someone's life, but being able to recognise that was a really profound moment. Of course we have so much more to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important that we be ambitious and that we seek to totally eliminate domestic and gendered violence in our communities within a generation. This is going to be incredibly hard work, but, if we don't set these ambitions for ourselves as governments, then we're not going to work towards trying to achieve them. We know we've got a lot of work to do that crosses a range of different portfolio areas, and I'm really pleased that every single minister takes very seriously the work in their portfolio when it comes to the contribution they can make to eliminating violence against women, whether it is through education, through frontline specialists and legal services or through the provision of health care and housing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This issue is—as it should be—a priority for our government. We have a lot of work to do collectively in this country to improve the situation. I, for one, stand absolutely committed to ensuring we eliminate violence against women and children within a generation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">La Trobe</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:18</span>):  I thank the member for this motion. I have made a number of speeches on this very topic, sadly, as have many other members of parliament. A quick internet search tells the tragic story of how many women are murdered in Australia. Everyone would have heard of Isla Bell, who was 19 years of age. Sadly, every day we read these issues in the media, and obviously that should never be the case. Police have charged a 53-year-old man days after family and friends were trying to find this beautiful young lady. Bell was last seen leaving her home about 6 pm on 4 October, but her family had earlier said the last contact they were aware of was via social media on 7 October. The missing persons squad raided two properties. I won't go into further details about the ongoing police investigation. On Wednesday, Bell's mother, Justine Spokes—and you can just imagine how the poor mother would feel—paid tribute to her beautiful, beloved daughter in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Age</span>:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Cherished forever and suffering no more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I am so sorry I could not protect you, that your experience of the world was cruel and unsafe. Despite your challenges, you lived bravely, stood up for what was right and remained the kindest human, the gentlest soul … With the deepest love and respect, your Mumma.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bell's family championed her search efforts, setting up social media pages, blanketing Melbourne's inner north with posters and repeatedly pleading with the public to help find their 19-year-old daughter. About a fortnight after Bell went missing, her mother told reporters that she thought her disappearance was strange.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's just awful for the mother and the family and friends to be trying to find this beautiful young girl. Sadly, they're not alone, as I said at the outset. According to Destroy the Joint's Counting Dead Women tally, 46 women were killed between January and August this year. In Victoria alone, Rebecca Young, 42, Samantha Murphy, 51, Chaithanya Madhagani, 35, and Hannah McGuire, 23, have been killed, allegedly by men, and just last week Bayswater woman Vicky Apostolopoulos's neighbour allegedly stabbed her to death in front of her two children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today is White Ribbon Day, which is marked on 25 November each year. It is also know as International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. It marks the start of days of activism against gender based violence, which runs from 25 November until 10 December.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you look at domestic violence, the data is horrific. As a former police officer, I know how bad it is for family members. I did write to the Chief Commissioner of Victoria Police about the need to ensure that multicultural women in particular are made aware, when there's an intervention order, that it's actually not them taking out the order, that they don't need a lawyer to go up against the defendant and that Victorian police and the government are actually supporting them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my portfolio as shadow minister for multicultural affairs, I've found that language barriers make it very difficult for women in a number of multicultural communities. There are also cultural issues that we need to deal with. When I go to multicultural events, especially in some communities, I'm very strong about making sure that it's very clear that people have to understand that, in Australia, everyone—women, men and children—is regarded as equal. If any woman wants to get a job, she is allowed to get a job. If she wants to get a drivers licence, she's allowed to get a drivers licence. If she wants visit friends and families, she's absolutely entitled to do that. Sometimes, in the case of victims I've spoken to, even their own families have said, 'No. You just need to put up with this.' You don't need to put up with this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I encourage all those women in situations where they're suffering from violence or harm to please go to police and please go to places like Orange Door and get support. We note that the government has put in $3.9 billion in response to rapid review into preventive approaches, and I thank them for that. Obviously more work needs to be done. I don't want to make this into any sort of political attack, but, working together, we all need to ensure that we do everything we can to protect women and children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, there'll be more speeches like this. I'll just make this final point: education is the key for change. The earlier we get to young men, the better lives women will have in the future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:23</span>):  I appreciate all the contributions that have been made on this issue. It is great to see that this is something that all members of parliament feel strongly about, regardless of what political party they are representing in this place. I think we are all onboard with the idea that violence against women and children needs to be stamped out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been to visit a refuge in my electorate. Whenever people ask me why the woman doesn't just leave, I want them to visit a refuge and experience how traumatic and difficult it is to be in a place like that. That is when you have extraordinary staff who are trying their best to support women and children fleeing domestic violence. But it is a really difficult place to live in. Often your entire family is squeezed into one room, having to share facilities with 20 or 30 other families. You don't have your paperwork in order to get your Centrelink payments set up. You often don't have clothes or other items that you need. It is a really difficult situation, and I take my hat off to the extraordinary people who work in the sector. They are doing extraordinary work to help support these women and children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I often wonder why it is always the woman who has to leave the home. It is always the woman who has to flee, and we need to change that as well. Because if she is fleeing with children then she is having to uproot their lives, having to figure out what school they are going to go to, how to get help and support for that family. The burden of all of that falls on her, and we need to change that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I held a domestic violence roundtable in my local community and I appreciate all the men and women who work in the space who came along to share their views. It was a fantastic discussion about what we could be doing locally to help support these families. One of the initiatives that sprung out of some of these discussions was to design a hub to give women the wraparound support that they need, whether it be talking to police, legal aid, Centrelink or a local community organisation or a translator. The police will tell you that sometimes when women are fleeing these situations they don't want to go to police; they just want safety for their kids. They just want to be out of that situation, so turning up to a police station is not necessarily the right course of action for them. Now these women can come to this hub and if they want to talk to the police, they can; if they want to get legal assistance, they can; or if they want to get that Centrelink payment or similar practical help and support to get away from the situation, they can. That would all be available to them there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been talking to principals in my local area who see the firsthand impact domestic violence is having on students. Principles have said to me that they have seen examples where the mother has worked up the courage to leave the situation. However, she wants the child to be able to stay the same school but cannot find a rental property in that area to enable the child to have that continuity of care and support within the school environment, so she ends up going back to the perpetrator. This is a situation we have set up where, when women get up the courage to leave, we force them into refuges and situations where they cannot get housing through the private rental system. This is a government that recognises that this is where the problem lies. We need to be providing housing support and that's why I'm rally proud of the work we're doing to provide $10 billion in funding to increase the amount of social and affordable housing that we will build, and a portion of that will be set aside for women and children fleeing domestic violence. That is going to be critical. Yes, we need to help police; yes, we need to help frontline workers but we also need to get housing sorted for these women who are fleeing some desperate situations. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:28</span>):  I thank the member for Newcastle for moving this motion. Firstly, I would like to acknowledge all those victims, those 66 victims, who have been murdered this year. My thoughts and prayers go to the families of those victims. I would also acknowledge victim-survivors for the work that you do in speaking out against domestic violence within Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All governments regardless of what side they sit on, regardless of what level, have tried to address this pandemic of domestic violence in Australia. It should be above politics, it should be bipartisan—how we work together—and I think that we do do that. We do recognise that it has to be a bipartisan approach. But we have failed. We have failed to address the core issue. I will be blunt: we have failed because we have not looked at prevention and intervention the way we should have. We have looked at response and recovery. I commend Labor on their commitment of $4 billion towards the prevention of family violence. But the fact is—and it was the same with the coalition when we were in government—a fraction of those billions of dollars goes towards prevention and intervention. Seventeen per cent of the $4 billion currently is going to measures to stop domestic violence. Let's call it for what it is. Men—not all men, but men—are the problem. So, in addressing the solution, we have to address men. We have to address solutions that address the causal problem or the causal issue. Whether that's men with drug or alcohol issues that lead to domestic violence or whether that's men who are coming from a place of trauma from domestic violence in their own childhoods, we have to address that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the shadow assistant minister for the prevention of family violence, I have travelled Australia and had almost 100 meetings with victims-survivors, agencies, police and support networks. We're now coming to that conversation. They agree. If we don't support men then how can we have healthy men? I am not suggesting that a man who commits an offence against a woman shouldn't be subject to the sentencing principles under the Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act of general deterrence and specific deterrence. They should go to jail. But what is there after they go to jail? Are there support networks to address the alcohol problem or the drug problem? That's why we need men's behavioural programs all around Australia. We need to have the funding for those programs. We need to have a nationally recognised program that is funded. There are waiting lists of hundreds and hundreds of men trying to get on these programs to improve themselves, to change their history and to change their future. So we have to be there to implement those programs. We need a national workforce funded to do that—somebody coming out of a TAFE or university course who says: 'I am not going to be an aged-care worker or a childcare worker; I want to move into a recognised workforce that supports men to change their behaviour, to change our future.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there's the education piece. We need to get a national curriculum into the school at kindergarten level, and that needs to travel with that child from kindergarten all the way through to year 12. It should not just be for boys. It should be across the board about healthy relationships and what a healthy person looks like. That's because a healthy child becomes a healthy adult and we will have a healthy society.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:33</span>):  As we mark the start of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, we must reflect on what more we can do to end this scourge of violence that has brutally taken the lives of so many women and destroyed the lives of their loved ones. It affects people across every part of our society. No matter the town you live in or your age, family or cultural background, domestic violence could affect you or a loved one. Around one in four women have experienced domestic violence from a partner or family member since the age of 15. This number is far too high, and that's why our government has a commitment to end family and domestic violence in one generation. That's why we're taking strong and immediate action towards this aim.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The safety of women and children experiencing family, domestic and sexual violence is a national priority for the Albanese Labor government and it has been since the day that we formed government. In our first three budgets we invested record funding for women's safety. Our most recent announcement after a second dedicated National Cabinet meeting on gendered violence brought the figure to $4 billion. All state and territory governments have committed to working to end violence within a generation through the National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children. The national plan was developed with victims-survivors, advocates and the family, domestic and sexual violence sector. Listening to people who have been doing this work for years is the best way to ensure our government is making the correct decisions and putting funding where it will have the biggest impact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through this, we have delivered much needed funding for frontline specialist support services and legal services. As part of the funding package, the Australian government will invest $3.9 billion in support for frontline legal assistance services to be delivered through a new National Access to Justice Partnership with the states and territories. Every part of the legal assistance sector will benefit from this funding. Importantly, this includes increased funding both for women's legal services and for family violence prevention legal services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also invested $85 million to deliver innovative approaches to better identify and respond to high-risk perpetrators to prevent homicide and keep women safe. By sharing information across systems and state borders, police and frontline services can intervene earlier and get women to safety. We have also invested in supporting women's economic security so that women don't need to choose between safety and poverty. We have made the leaving violence payment permanent, providing $5,000 to people leaving intimate partner violence, 10 days of paid domestic and family violence leave for all employees, including casuals, and expanding the single-parent payment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year, as a co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Ending Violence against Women and Children with the member for Bass and Senator Waters, I've had the pleasure to meet with many groups that are responsible for prevention activities across the country and organising events to engage all members of parliament in these important discussions. From saturation models to working directly with perpetrators to stop reoffending, these groups are doing critical frontline work to protect Australian women and children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government's investment into prevention is through respectful relationships education and consent campaigns. We are also supporting the work of Our Watch, the national primary prevention organisation and expressing exposure to online harms for children and young people. We know that ending family and domestic violence is everyone's responsibility not just the government's, but that government has a really important role to play. We all need to work together to make sure that we can end domestic violence in our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the time I have remaining, I want to acknowledge the incredible work of local organisations in my electorate of Canberra and in the ACT more broadly. I find it really hard to find words that do justice to the incredible work that those organisations do to support women and their families in the darkest times and the most difficult times of their lives. I don't want to forget anyone, but I want to acknowledge the Domestic Violence Crisis Service, the Rape Crisis Centre, the Women's Legal Centre, the YWCA and there are many more. It was wonderful to announce a pilot program to help train GPs, who are often the first port of call, to identify and support victims. The amazing Dr Anita Hutchison, who has long been an advocate, has an important role in that and that's going to support GPs to support women in this space too.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been a challenging year for many Australians—families, students, elderly and small-business owners—especially those living in Fowler and Western Sydney. Whether it is combatting the rise in the cost of living or striving to keep their small businesses afloat, Australians are feeling the pressure and are in need of effective policy measures that will support them during this difficult time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have knocked door to door within my Fowler electorate and have held numerous forums to understand the pressing issues and needs of my constituents. Recently I held a manufacturing forum and engaged with small and medium-sized businesses and enterprises—SMEs—within the manufacturing sector to discuss pain points and opportunities. These are some of the comments that the attendees shared: 'I may have to consider scaling down my business as I cannot afford to operate it.' 'How does the $325 electricity rebate provide enough support when my electricity bill is $10,000?' 'My equipment costs more than the instant write-off offered. Can the government expand this?' 'I'm having trouble attracting talent within our industry. We are short staffed.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was the recurring theme within the manufacturing forum: SMEs grappling with rising operating costs, shortages of skilled labour and limited access to critical resources. Steve Facer, the CEO of Chess Industries, shared how the cost of doing business is now significantly higher, impacting their ability to grow within the manufacturing industry. He said: 'It would be good to have the government provide some form of support in lowering interest rates, insurance and operative costs. This is what is affecting small manufacturing businesses' growth.' Another local food manufacturer owner, Henry, spoke about the cost of equipment being substantially higher and about there being pressure to keep up with technology to remain competitive. This is a costly exercise that not all small businesses can afford. Gus Medina, the managing director of Medina Engineering, which specialises in manufacturing purpose-built machinery, stated, 'There needs to be more funding for upskilling employees, such as digitally enhancing their ability to operate machinery utilising computers.' I have also recently shared BE Campbell's difficulty with labour gaps within their business and their struggle to attract talent within the meat industry, leaving them to consider a scale-down in business. This is just a handful of manufacturers' voices amongst the many that have reached out to me to seek representation and support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken many times in this House about the importance of manufacturing in my electorate of Fowler, where it makes up about 12 per cent of the workforce. Hundreds of manufacturing businesses in South-West and Western Sydney produce essential goods across a variety of sectors, from food production and building materials to medical supplies and recycling initiatives. The only relief offered in the May budget was a $325 electricity rebate for individuals and, I think, $300 for small businesses and a tax deduction on the cost of eligible assets costing less than $20,000—and a couple of hundred dollars off energy bills, as I said. As we all know, the cost of equipment has gone up tremendously. In the supply chain, everything has gone up tremendously, and we need to really focus on what further support we can provide for many small businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The feedback I have received from the manufacturing forum attendees was that this was not good enough from the government. There is also fear and uncertainty about whether this lifeline would be extended the year after. It is clear that we need to do better to support the SMEs, particularly those within manufacturing, so they can thrive and continue to grow the Australian economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion is to call for the government to not turn a blind eye on the struggling SME manufacturers and to take further action by (1) creating further funding opportunities for SMEs to upskill their workforce as technology continues to advance; (2) promoting a career to young Australians and migrant workers by continuing and expanding government investment in training initiatives, apprenticeships, English language training and foundational skills development; (3) increasing the instant write-off to $50,000 and indefinitely extending this initiative to give SMEs breathing room to operate without the pressures of heightened costs; and (4) lowering the cost of doing business by addressing the escalating costs of insurance, freight, energy and compliance, which disproportionately impact small and medium manufacturers. I have taken the time and effort to consult with my electorate, and the call for action is not unreasonable. SMEs in manufacturing need the government's support and they need it now; otherwise they will continue to be left behind.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="298840" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr REPACHOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:44</span>):  There is no government that prioritises manufacturing more than this Labor government. It's true that manufacturing today is not what it was in its glory days, and that is deeply concerning not only to me but also to the Australian Labor Party. A strong manufacturing sector is vital for a strong economy and a stronger Australia. Manufacturing creates jobs for Australians and ensures the high quality standards that come with products made right here at home. Unfortunately, times have changed, and our manufacturing industry is now a shadow of its former self. We no longer produce the mighty Holden Commodores or Ford Falcons or ship steel from the port of Newcastle. It's a shame. We stand here in a building that is more than 90 per cent made from Australian made products, from the steel used to make the flagpole, made in Newcastle, to some of the furniture, but Australian manufacturing has declined.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this government is determined to change that. Through our $22.7 billion Future Made in Australia package, we are taking decisive action to revive this sector and secure its future. Our plan includes the transformative National Reconstruction Fund, which will create secure, well-paid jobs, support regional development and strengthen Australia's sovereign capability. Closer to home in my electorate, we're investing $1 billion into the Solar Sunshot program, which includes our SunDrive solar-panel-manufacturing facility and the opportunity to produce the most efficient solar panels in the world right there in the Hunter on the site of the old Liddell Power Station. This will produce more than 500 jobs in stage 1 and up to 5,000 jobs in stage 2. This isn't just about making things we need; it's about positioning Australia as a leader in the global push towards renewable energy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let's not forget the challenges. The member for Fowler has raised concerns about labour shortages and resource access in manufacturing, but she conveniently overlooked the government's proactive solutions, including fee-free TAFE. More than half a million Australians have already taken advantage of this program to gain skills in critical areas like manufacturing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me be clear: these opportunities would vanish under those opposite. We have recently seen exactly what they think of fee free TAFE. Last week they voted against fee free TAFE, and the opposition leader has already said it's wasteful spending and he will cut it. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition recently claimed that people don't value fee-free TAFE because, as she puts it, 'If you don't pay for something, you don't value it.' That might be true if you've never struggled to make ends meet, but, for hardworking Australians, this could not be further from the truth or reality. The opposition's record speaks for itself. They drove our car-manufacturing industry offshore, ignored skills shortages and left our manufacturing sector in disarray.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is delivering real solutions. Our $400 million Industry Growth Program is already supporting emerging manufacturers across the country. This program feeds directly into the $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund, the largest investment in Australian industry in living memory. It provides matched grants, advisory services and expert guidance to small and medium businesses, with more than 1,100 innovative companies already signing up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're not just investing in manufacturing; we're building a resilient small-business sector. Small business employs over five million Australians and contributes more than $500 billion to our economy each year. That's why this government has rolled out more than $640 million in targeted support, including energy rebates, and extended the $20,000 instant asset write-off. Under this government, insolvencies have remained at record lows of just 0.25 per cent, compared to the 0.32 per cent averaged under the last government. We have also improved cash flow for small businesses, with reforms that name and shame big businesses that fail to pay on time or create, while celebrating those that do the right thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Future Made in Australia plan is about maximising the economic and industrial benefits of the global transformation to net zero. We're creating secure jobs, attracting private investment and ensuring our economy is powered by renewable energy, not nuclear reactors that will only drive up prices. This government understands that Australians' future lies in a strong, diversified economy. We're creating the conditions for manufacturing to thrive, for small business to grow and for Aussies to succeed. The question is: will we seize these opportunities or let those opposite take them back and take us backwards? The choice is clear. This Labor government shows that the Labor Party is the only party committed to reviving Australian manufacturing and securing a stronger and more prosperous future for all.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:49</span>):  I commend the member for Fowler for bringing this very important motion to this House. I also commend the contribution of the member for Hunter, who mentioned the manufacturers and builders who made the very house which we're standing in today. It reminds me that Eugowra, that very extraordinary town in the electorate of Calare, contributed the granite to this place. Eugowra, of course, was devastated by the storms and floods in November 2022. But the fact that the member for Hunter harks back to the building of this place makes us appreciate not only the role that manufacturing has in the electorate of Calare, through Eugowra granite, but also the role of manufacturing around Australia, including in the member for Fowler's electorate, which she's very concerned about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue here is that manufacturers and manufacturing represent production, and, to my way of thinking, the wealth of this country must always be based on what we make, grow and sell. That means manufacturing, and, if we want manufacturing to continue in this country, we need to make it easier for manufacturers to do business and to thrive, employ people and keep production going, along with our other sectors like agriculture, so that we can continue to have the unbeatable quality of life and prosperity that we enjoy in this nation, which we need to hand down to future generations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Fowler rightly points out, this is a very difficult business environment that our manufacturers find themselves in—and, indeed, that all of our business operators find themselves in at the moment. The cost of doing business is actually very high. We have labour shortages. We have a lot of red tape, which is difficult for small to medium-sized businesses to deal with. We have the high cost of materials and inputs and the high cost of power. I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that many of our manufacturers are at breaking point.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Central West, we have many manufacturing operations that would be struggling with these high costs. We also have a lot of food manufacturing and processing taking place in the Central West. We have, for example, Simplot, which makes the iconic Chiko Roll for Australia and, indeed, the world. We have Ferrero, which makes Tic Tacs and Nutella. We have flour milling and canola oil manufacturing in Manildra. We have pet food manufacturing in Blayney, through Nestle Purina, and in Bathurst, through Mars. In Bathurst, we've got Devro, which makes sausage casings. And there are many, many more food and other manufacturing operations that are struggling with the high cost of power. We need to be taking concrete measures to make life easier for them so that they can continue to drive economic growth and prosperity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Fowler has come to this place and put forward the proposal that the instant asset write-off should be increased to $50,000 and extended indefinitely. I think that is a very worthy and worthwhile proposal, and I think many of our small and medium-sized manufacturing operations—and, indeed, businesses everywhere—would benefit from that. What it would mean is that businesses can make a purchase—an investment in, for example, machinery or equipment—and get the tax benefit in the year that they make the purchase, rather than having it written down over several years. We have seen in the past how important the instant asset write-off is for driving growth and investment, so I think it's very commendable that the member for Fowler is thinking about new and innovative ways that we can be helping small to medium-sized businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Her motion also talks about 'lowering the cost of doing business by addressing the escalating costs for'—for example—'insurance, freight, energy and compliance, which disproportionately impact small and medium-sized manufacturers', and she's right about that. We also need to be promoting manufacturing as a career to young Australians by expanding government investment in training initiatives and apprenticeships, including for new Australians—something which I think is really important. The member for Fowler has put a lot of thought into this motion, and her words resonate across Australia and to manufacturers everywhere. We, as a nation, need to be doing more to help our struggling manufacturing sector. I commend this motion to the House.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="299150" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LAWRENCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:54</span>):  I too agree with the member for Fowler. Small and medium-sized enterprises are fundamental to the Australian economy. They contribute significantly to job creation and economic resilience. So does the preparation of a skilled workforce, with appropriate training available to everyone. Small and medium-sized enterprises need skilled workers just as large ones do too. Skilled workers can, and do, create small and medium-sized enterprises of their own. All they need is opportunity, and that's precisely what the Albanese Labor government is giving them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nine out of 10 of the new jobs of the next decade will require post-secondary qualifications. Almost half of them will come through VET pathways. When we came into office in 2022 Australia was experiencing the biggest skills shortages in more than half a century after years of coalition neglect and worse than neglect. We have already created more than half a million free TAFE positions, on their way to filling the shortages across the areas of need. And we have created a manufacturing sector fit for 21st-century purpose. Now, we're committing to at least 100,000 free TAFE places every year. Many of those workers will be going into and later creating new manufacturing enterprises and new manufacturing jobs across Australia. Labor has provided them, and all of us, with a $400 million Industry Growth Program, a program we created to support emerging manufacturers everywhere, including in the electorate of Fowler. The program directly links with the National Reconstruction Fund with a $15 billion investment—that's the largest investment in Australian history in living memory. The Liberals and their friends don't like to talk about that. Perhaps it's because they are embarrassed. This is a direct encouragement of homegrown Australian business, providing finance to support projects that drive high-value industry transformation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Industry Growth Program invests in small businesses across the National Reconstruction Fund's seven priority areas: resources; transport; medical; science; defence capability; renewables and low-emissions technologies; agriculture, forestry and fisheries; and enabling capabilities. It's a declaration of faith in our country and the capacities of our people. We encourage small and medium enterprises everywhere in Australia to apply for this funding, which will help them to commercialise and grow their ideas. The program also provides an advisory service to give them access to the experts who can work beside them to help them plan that growth. The expert advisers are available in every state and territory. Innovative SMEs aren't shy. More than 1,100 have already signed up. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Matched grant funding, from $50,000 to $5 million, is also available for SMEs looking to grow. All of this is part of our determination to create a future made in Australia, by Australians, for Australians, and that's why we created the free TAFE positions that are already changing the lives of more than half a million Australians and will do so for years to come. That's a thought that never seems to have occurred to the Liberals. Even today they scorn it—a great policy they won't match.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government believes in all of Australia. It's why we're building a stronger, more diversified and more resilient economy. It's already happening in the less than three years in office. If only the Liberals had played a part in this during their nine years, we would be much further along the way. Thought bubbles like their absurd nuclear pipe dreams won't do the trick. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everywhere, except in the coalition party rooms, people understand that there's a global movement towards net zero. This is a global transformation which stands to provide enormous economic and industrial benefits to Australia. Our Future Made in Australia plan is a plan, not a pipe dream. It's already at work, creating secure, skilled and well-paid jobs. But the Liberals have never been particularly interested in secure, well-paid jobs, although I know many Independents are, like the member for Fowler. The Liberals never saw a pay rise application they liked, and they have repeatedly acted to weaken the power of Australian workers to advocate for improved conditions. We know that our future growth prospects lie in the intersection of Australia's industrial, resources, skills and energy bases. They all have to be strengthened and brought together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I absolutely agree with the member for Fowler on the importance of small and medium-sized business enterprises, and I speak from direct and personal experience. There's a world of opportunity out there, and the Albanese Labor government is working for all Australians to ensure that we open up all of them.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="R36" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:01</span>):  The Online Safety Amendment (Social Media Minimum Age) Bill 2024 is all about supporting parents and protecting children. I want to pay tribute to the Minister for Communications for the work that she has done in bringing forward this landmark legislation. It is about making sure that children have a childhood and parents have peace of mind. It's about this parliament working together to lock this change in. We're doing more than setting a new minimum age of 16 for social media; we are setting a new community standard, making it clear that social media companies have a social responsibility and sending a message to all those mums and dads who are worried about the impact that social media is having on their children's wellbeing, mental health, confidence and sense of self. That message is simple: we are on your side, and we've got your back.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want young Australians to grow up happy, active and safe, playing outside with their friends—off their phones and on the footy and cricket fields, the tennis and netball courts, at the swimming pool and the beach, or in any sport that grabs their interest or, indeed, just engaging with each other on a face-to-face basis. I want them to learn how to win, how to lose and how to work as a team. I want them to learn about resilience and being part of their community; to discover music and art; to be confident in the classroom and at home; to be confident in themselves and around their peers; and to gain and grow from these real experiences with real people, face to face.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know from experience that schools banning phones in the classroom has had an uplifting experience, both in an improvement in students' learning but also through kids engaging with each other at play lunch, at lunchtime and after school. It has made a difference. Every parent and every level of government understands the benefits of all of these things to individuals, families and society as a whole. That's why we invest in grassroots sport and community facilities. That's why we invest in infrastructure and the programs that support them because we know that social interaction provides a social benefit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, we know social media is causing social harm. The figures are very clear. I was watching <span style="font-style:italic;">Insiders</span> yesterday, and they had a graph of hospitalisations of young people for mental health issues since 2010. That graph is scary, in particular, for young women, but also for young men. There is a clear causal link between the rise of social media and the harm to the mental health of young Australians. And, indeed, it is not just young Australians; this is an issue that governments around the world are grappling with. I was talking with leaders of Europe and North America and countries in our own region as well, including Prime Minister Luxon of New Zealand, last week. They are all looking at what we are doing and they are applauding what we are doing, in showing leadership in this area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that social media can be a weapon for bullies, a platform for peer pressure, a driver of anxiety, a vehicle for scammers and, worst of all, a tool for online predators. Because it is young Australians who are most engaged with this technology, it is young Australians who are most at risk. That's why we want to set the minimum age for social media at 16. As we develop and mature, we're better at spotting the fakes and the dangers. We build up the mental resilience to ignore the worst of the nastiness. We learn the difference between online followers and true and real friends. We learn not to measure ourselves and our lives against impossible standards or a fake image of perfection.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those of us in public life know not to look at the comments section, but it's even harder for young people to deal with some of what people will say online that they would never say face to face. As we get older, we do learn not to measure ourselves and our lives against impossible standards or a fake image of perfection. If children don't have that chance to learn, if they don't have the grounding of real experiences and real friendships to support them, if they fall into the vortex of thinking what happens online is all that matters, then we know the consequences can be devastating.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to recognise some of the strongest advocates for action in this area are parents grieving the loss of a child, mothers and fathers determined to spare other parents the pain and the sadness they have had to endure. I've had the solemn privilege of meeting with some of them. I know other members of this place have as well. Their loss is unimaginable. Their courage and selflessness is extraordinary. To take that personal grieving and channel it into making a difference for others is remarkably courageous. We owe it to those families—indeed, we owe it to every family—to do everything we can to help.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make five points about the specific detail of this legislation and why it is worthy of the unanimous support of this parliament. Firstly, this bill puts the onus on social media companies, not young people, not their parents. We know that every law that applies to teenagers will be tested by teenagers. We're not seeking to penalise young people pushing their luck. The penalties in this legislation apply to social media companies that don't make sufficient effort and allow for systemic breaches. There are fines of nearly $50 million, serious penalties, because we are taking this seriously.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, there are common sense exemptions. We want to make sure that young people can continue to access health and education related services—Headspace, YouTube, Google Classroom—as well as messaging services and online games.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, there will be very strong and strict privacy requirements to protect people's personal information, including an obligation to destroy information provided once age has been verified. We'll fund the Information Commissioner to oversee this work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourthly, this bill is realistic about how fast technology moves and how quickly new platforms can appear on the landscape. That's why there is a balance of decision-making power between the minister, the eSafety Commissioner and the parliament, recognising that we all have a part to play in making sure this legislation keeps up with evolving challenges.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fifth and final point is about effectiveness. I've seen people point out that nowhere else in the world has this been done yet. That's true, but I also know that every serious government in the world is grappling with this issue and looking to take action. When it comes to the wellbeing of our young people, I don't want Australia to wait around on the rest of the world; I want Australia to be one of the leading nations in the world. Equally, I've seen people say the law won't fix everything, and it won't work in every situation. That's correct. You can't have perfect law in an area like this, relating to technology, that will work 100 per cent perfectly 100 per cent of the time. But we can't make perfection a barrier to action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In many ways, one of the great values of this law is the message that it sends and the backup it provides to parents across Australia who feel out of their depth and worried about where all this will end. It's for the parents of a young boy or girl coming home and saying, 'My friend I sit next to in the classroom has access to all this; why don't I?' This is a tool for parents to work with their sons or daughters. This will provide an important tool for parents who worry about their children, as we all do, from the very day that they're born. It never stops.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What's different about this issue compared to the conversations we have with our children about drinking or other activities is that parents don't have their own childhoods to look back to as a frame of reference. It is different, and, until now, not only have they not had that; they haven't had the law to support them, either. Of course, parents already have the option of banning phones or particular social media platforms for their children, but that does mean going up against the power of peer pressure. It means making their child the odd one out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is about taking the pressure off parents and teachers. It lets them point to the authority of government and the law and say: 'This is the way it is. This is the same standard for everyone.' We have a drinking age of 18 because, as a society, we recognise that alcohol carries risks that are more severe for young people. Now, underage drinking does occur, but it's much less common than it would be if there were no legal limit. It's a lot easier for parents, teachers and older siblings to engage with young Australians on the topic of drinking responsibly when there is that community standard to back them up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been considerable engagement with the opposition on this legislation. I'm grateful for the bipartisan way in which we've been able to work together. Many of us on both sides come to this issue drawing on our experience as parents, and that's important. But we're also parliamentarians. We have the privilege and indeed the responsibility of being able to do more than sympathise with those who have seen the very worst harm social media can cause. We can do more than worry about what all this will mean for young Australians today and future generations. We can do something about it. We can change the law. We can help drive a change in attitude, culture and behaviour across our country. We can drive a change in the schoolyards and around kitchen tables, and that's the opportunity before us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the communications minister and I did a press conference in the Prime Minister's courtyard a couple of weeks ago, one of the questions from the media was, 'How will young people engage if they can't do it online and set up a Facebook group to campaign,' and everything else. I spoke about my own experience as a very young man with my first political campaign on the Sydney City Council, whose housing my mum was born in; she died in the same house 65 years later. Conservatives got control and wanted to flog it off because they didn't believe in social housing. It's something that's still there, apparently. We ran a campaign. We didn't do it online; we went and talked to people. We knocked on doors, we collected petitions and we engaged to mobilise the community. That's what you can do. That's what people can do in the whole sphere of public space: engage with each other, learn to communicate, learn to engage in a positive and constructive way, convince people about your point of view, or just chat about what you did on the weekend.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember watching a <span style="font-style:italic;">Modern Family</span> episode where they were all sitting around the kitchen table and texting each other instead of talking. This is an issue for our society. As public officeholders we need to speak about the public space and the impact that these things have. When it comes to young people we've got a particular responsibility, and that's the opportunity before us. Let's seize it. Let's give children back their childhood and let's give parents new peace of mind. Let's work together to pass this legislation through the House of Representatives and the Senate this week. It will be something that we can be very proud of.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is another major step in implementing the Albanese Labor government's Future Made in Australia agenda, to help deliver our country's next generation of prosperity.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It builds on the other two pieces of Future Made in Australia legislation that have already passed this House and which will embed into law the disciplined and rigorous approach that will govern this agenda.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also builds on the significant and substantial progress we've made in delivering cleaner and cheaper energy since coming to office: unlocking $67 billion in private investment through the Capacity Investment Scheme, introducing a new vehicle fuel efficiency standard, providing low-cost finance for household energy upgrades and reforming the safeguard mechanism.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The most important role for public investment will be to help unlock the vast amounts of private sector capital that we will need to deploy—an additional $225 billion by 2050 to transition the energy system and realise net zero opportunities in heavy industries, by one estimate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill does three main things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, it will establish a hydrogen tax incentive worth $2 for every kilogram of renewable hydrogen produced by eligible projects that have reached a final investment decision before July 2030.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, it will establish a critical minerals tax incentive worth 10 per cent of the value of relevant mineral processing and refining costs for the production of any of Australia's 31 critical minerals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Both incentives apply for hydrogen or minerals produced between 2027-28 and 2039-40 and for up to 10 years per project. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, it will expand the role and remit of Indigenous Business Australia to help support more investment into Indigenous communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These communities have some of the most to gain from the transition to net zero—and this legislation will help unlock these benefits. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Renewable hydrogen and critical minerals are both essential to the world's path to decarbonisation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government sees them playing a central role in Australia's net zero future, and these tax incentives make that clear.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation provides industry the clarity and certainty that it needs to invest in Australian renewable hydrogen and critical minerals projects with confidence. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The incentive is only provided once projects are up and running, producing hydrogen or processed critical minerals for things like wind turbines, solar panels and electric vehicles. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Renewable hydrogen will open the door to create green metals, like iron, steel, alumina and aluminium, and decarbonise other parts of industrial supply chains.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our world-class renewable energy resources make us one of the best-placed countries globally to produce green hydrogen at internationally competitive prices.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of our biggest trading partners have already expressed a significant appetite for importing renewable hydrogen from us, including through trade in products that are produced from green hydrogen, like green ammonia or green metals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our unique combination of geology, meteorology and geography all play an important role here.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The tax incentive enabled by this legislation will complement our Hydrogen Headstart program. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Hydrogen Headstart is helping early movers invest in the industry's development, and these tax changes provide broader support to projects that reach the production stage. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From manufacturing to transport, from medicine to telecommunications, so many industries rely on critical minerals to function.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some scenarios estimate global demand for critical minerals will increase by around 350 per cent by 2040 to reach net zero emissions by 2050. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is in such a strong position to supply these minerals, with some of the world's largest reserves of lithium, cobalt and rare earths. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to capture more value onshore by refining and processing the minerals here, and that's what this tax change will incentivise. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will encourage more Australian critical mineral companies to create more value on our shores and create more diverse, resilient and sustainable global supply chains as a consequence.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will help critical minerals miners become critical minerals refiners and processors as well.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is part of a package of three bills which together will formalise longstanding Commonwealth practice by providing express, modernised and consistent legislative authority for Commonwealth entities to continue to charge and collect payment surcharges where the entity has the legislative authority to collect a payment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Payment surcharges are commonly imposed by businesses and governments across Australia, including by Commonwealth entities. A payment surcharge is an additional amount paid by a person to cover the acceptance cost of a chosen payment method. Payment surcharges are limited to the amount it costs the merchant (including a Commonwealth entity) to accept that type of payment for that transaction under arrangements with the merchant's banking provider.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Surcharging signals to consumers the cost of their payment method and acknowledges the difference in costs across card and other payment methods. Surcharges cannot exceed merchants' 'cost of acceptance' for card payments. These price signals allow consumers to make more efficient and informed payment choices, and many consumers choose lower cost or no-cost payment options. When making payments to Commonwealth entities, consumers have a choice of how they will make that payment and information is available about whether a surcharge applies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, there are several ways to make a payment to the Australian Taxation Office. Different payment methods are offered so that customers can choose a method that suits them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A range of payment methods are offered, including electronic transfer and direct debit, as well as paying in person at Australia Post. For some payments, such as using a Visa, Mastercard or American Express card, a card payment fee will apply, but many consumers and businesses choose this payment method. They may choose these payment methods because they find them convenient or they are attracted to card benefits such as reward programs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The package of bills does not impose new surcharges on those interacting with the Commonwealth, but instead formalises the existing practices of Commonwealth entities under a new modernised whole-of-government framework. To that end, the bills authorise the collection of surcharges by Commonwealth entities from 1 January 2003, to align with when the Reserve Bank of Australia first regulated payment surcharging as part of the then broader payments reforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also enable the responsible minister to make Commonwealth surcharging policies, by legislative instrument to support, moving forward, a whole-of -Commonwealth approach to surcharging, including ensuring that any surcharging is applied on a cost recovery basis only. This will also facilitate timely adoption of any changes to whole-of-government surcharging policy by Commonwealth entities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This package of bills supports the government's broader commitment to reviewing and reforming the imposition of card payment surcharges. The government is prepared to permanently ban all surcharges on debit cards from 1 January 2026, subject to further work by the Reserve Bank of Australia and safeguards to ensure both small businesses and consumers can benefit from lower costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Reserve Bank of Australia completes its important work on the surcharging review and how payment fees can be reduced economy-wide, we will stop passing on debit surcharges from the Australian Taxation Office and Services Australia from 1 January 2025.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">That the amendments be agreed to.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my first speech in this place, just over five years ago, I called on members of parliament to make our differences in detail a healthy contest of ideas, of reason and of evidence designed to take us to robust solutions; to strive to disagree without being disagreeable; and to model the way for Australians to debate complex issues, to win the era instead of the 6 pm news skirmish. I believe that we have achieved that together with this incredibly complex and nuanced debate on this reform that will create a new and enduring foundation for aged-care reform from 1 July 2025 and for years to come. I thank members and senators—and especially Senator Anne Ruston—who worked with the government on this reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today marks the passage of the most impactful aged-care reform in 30 years. Today our rights based Aged Care Bill will pass the parliament, putting older people and not providers at the centre of aged care. The new Support at Home program will support all of us to live independently in our own homes for as long as possible as we age. The aged-care system will be fair and financially sustainable, with those who can afford it making contributions towards the cost of their own care. Older people will be cared for by skilled workers who are properly respected and fairly paid.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill puts high-quality, safe and compassionate care and services first. It implements a system of caring for older people living with dementia that incorporates contemporary evidence based care, and it delivers our election commitment for better, more appetising and more nutritious food underscored by new food standards. The government's amendments are designed to address key concerns that were raised by the aged-care sector, older people and unions during the community affairs inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to acknowledge the work of the committee chair, Senator Marielle Smith, and members Senator Pratt and Senator Urquhart in addition to everyone who took the time to make a written or verbal submission. Committee members travelled to nine public hearings across every state and territory. They heard from over 150 people, including 28 witnesses who shared their lived experience of aged care. In total, the inquiry received over 180 submissions by people affected by aged care and by their advocates and representatives, as well as by service providers and other stakeholders across the aged-care sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of the amendments tabled by the government are to amend a number of key definitions and concepts in response to stakeholder feedback, to make key changes to the enforceability of the statement of rights and the corresponding condition of registration, to implement the recommendation that a review of accommodation pricing be brought forward to report to 1 July 2026 and included in the bill, to mandate financial hardship as a circumstance for the fee reduction supplement, to remove decision-making supporters and streamline and strengthen the safeguards in place for the supported decision-making framework, to sunset the immunity provision for restricted practices and to make minor policy and technical corrections to the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also commend amendments made by Senator David Pocock and the opposition during Senate debate. I thank the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="210911" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TEHAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:41</span>):  It is good when oppositions and governments can work together to put bills through the parliament. And it's very good when governments admit that, when they were in opposition, they got it completely wrong and, once they get into government, they understand that they need to make amends. That's what this bill is—the Migration Amendment (Prohibiting Items in Immigration Detention Facilities) Bill 2024. For those who've been around a little while, they'll remember that twice when we were in government we tried to put through legislation which would have given our Border Force more powers when it comes to detention centres. Unfortunately, those opposite, who are now in government, when they were in opposition, wouldn't support those bills. Now they're in government, they've realised that they do have to take responsible action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is especially the case at the moment. In July this year, Australians were shocked by media reports that the New South Wales police had charged a detainee for allegedly running a sophisticated drug operation from inside the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre. An Australian Border Force commander, Budhy Tanddo, at the time said, 'The ABF's limited powers place additional pressure on already stretched police resources.' In a separate report in September, ABF Assistant Commissioner Sarah Nicolson, when discussing organised crime operating within the immigration detention centre, said: 'Detainees have access to telecommunications devices and computers while in detention. Under existing arrangements, there is no ability for the ABF to restrict access to these items, including dedicated encrypted telecommunications devices.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we were in government, we sought to address these issues through the Migration Amendment (Prohibiting Items in Immigration Detention Facilities) Bill 2017 and the Migration Amendment (Prohibiting Items in Immigration Detention Facilities) Bill 2020. It was a shame that the then opposition didn't back those bills, because we wouldn't be here now if that had been the case, and what happened this year might not have happened, with organised crime running a drug racket out of Villawood detention centre. So I'm hopeful that the government will admit the error of their ways and will say, when they're talking on this bill: 'Mea culpa. We got it wrong. We got it wrong on two occasions and we've got to apologise to the Australian people for that and at least we've come to our senses now.' I doubt whether that is going to happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will be interesting to see who speaks on this bill, because my old sparring mate—he has now moved on—Andrew Giles said, when speaking on this bill in 2020:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill, fundamentally, is a solution in search of a problem … But the fact is this: the government already has the powers it needs. The government already has the powers to remove prohibited items from people in immigration detention facilities. So Labor believes that if this bill were to be passed in its current form then it would result in serious, adverse and unwarranted consequences in respect of individuals in those facilities and more broadly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You can just see from that why the former immigration minister was such a disaster, because he couldn't even recognise there was a problem. But I look forward to him coming in and now voting for the bill. Maybe we will get a mea culpa.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Labor and I oppose this bill, in summary, for a couple of reasons: there is no justification for this bill and its sweeping powers, and it is also a bill which has clear impingements upon the human rights of detainees.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it will be very interesting to see what members who said such strong things in such strong language only four years ago now have to say about this bill and its passage through the parliament. I hope that they will be able to admit that they got it wrong, admit the error of their ways and say, 'Yes, it is a bit harder when you're in government. It is a little bit more difficult when you are in government. You do have to take some action. Otherwise, what you might see is a drug syndicate being run out of Villawood detention centre.' I will leave it up to those opposite as to how big the mea culpa will be, but hopefully there will be some understanding that on two occasions they got it very, very wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What are the provisions in this bill? The Migration Amendment (Prohibiting Items in Immigration Detention Facilities) Bill 2024 allows the minister to determine that certain items are prohibited in relation to immigration detention facilities and detainees if the minister is satisfied that possession or use of that thing might be a risk to the health, safety or security of persons in the facility or to the order of the facility. Prohibited things may include controlled drugs and prescription drugs not taken by the person to whom they are prescribed, mobile phone subscriber identity module, or SIM, cards and other internet capable devices. The amendments will also expand an authorised officer's power to search, screen and seize prohibited things in relation to immigration detention facilities and detainees without a warrant if the person exercising the power believes on reasonable grounds that doing so is reasonable and necessary to mitigate security and safety risk. The bill also includes amendments that will, in certain circumstances, allow a detainee to continue having access to alternative means of communication, if a prohibited communication device is seized, to enable the detainee to communicate with family or to obtain support—for example, legal advice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill substantially mirrors the provisions introduced in the coalition bills, but with editions that specify certain conditions and limits on the powers being introduced. The coalition strongly supports measures to assist operational staff to crack down on the organised crime that is running rife in our immigration detention facilities, which is why we will be supporting this legislation without amendment. And I say to those opposite: better late than never. That is one positive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I'll look forward to what the member for Fremantle has to say, given his words, which I will quote to him:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… this bill is not about a proportionate response from government but about cruelty and politics. Cruelty and politics are what are governing this bill and its creation.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most Australians would say that this is just common sense. If you've got people who are nonresidents of this country and are in detention, we should be doing all we can to stop them from basically running an organised crime racket from inside that detention centre. Especially if they're running drug-trafficking operations, we should be doing all we can to stop it. That is why we support this bill.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the private Members' business order of the day relating to the Doctors for the Bush Bill 2024 being called on immediately and being given priority over all other business for final determination of this House.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill needs to be debated urgently. There is a crisis unfolding in rural and regional Australia. It's a health crisis. It's a disaster unfolding before our eyes, and its consequences are absolutely devastating. This is an urgent matter. My Doctors for the Bush Bill actually does something about this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All over central-western NSW and around country Australia, doctors are leaving the bush and they are not being replaced. Around the Calare electorate, the rural doctor shortage crisis is being felt in communities big and small. Gulgong had four doctors but now doesn't have any doctors at all, and this is putting pressure on larger towns like Mudgee. It has two medical practices and they are both no longer accepting any new patients. Practices in communities like Canowindra and Molong have also lost doctors and they are also closing their books to new patients or adopting a locals-only policy for appointments. In Wellington, it now takes two months to see a GP. The impact this crisis is having on the health of country people is very concerning and very shocking. It was only recently that I spoke to one local doctor, who said that they recently met one patient who had advanced cancer and had not been able to get in to see a doctor and had therefore missed out on vital treatment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The rural doctor shortage crisis has been made much worse because country areas no longer have priority for overseas trained doctors. Before July 2022, if an overseas trained doctor or international medical graduate, as they are known, wanted to practise in Australia and bill Medicare they had to work in a country area for 10 years, unless that was reduced because they worked in more remote areas. These country areas were and still are known as distribution priority areas. For many rural areas, this policy was a lifeline, providing badly needed access to GPs and basic medical services. But all that changed in 2022 when the Labor government upended the Distribution Priority Area system and, for the first time, allowed outer metropolitan areas to become distribution priority areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the Australian public tuning in now, all parts of Australia are classified according to what is called the Modified Monash Model. There are seven categories, ranging from MM 1, which is a major city, to MM 7, which is very remote. Previously areas MM 3 to MM 7 were distribution priority areas. To give people context, large regional centres like Bathurst and Orange are classified as MM 3; Lithgow and Mudgee are MM 4; Molong, Gulgong and Canowindra are MM 5. The government has now declared MM 2 areas as distribution priority areas, therefore destroying the priority for overseas trained doctors that country areas once had. This means that areas such as Fairfield, Hornsby and Warringah and the outer suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne now have the same priority as country areas for overseas trained doctors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you look at the map, it's quite clear that the whole state of New South Wales is basically one big Distribution Priority Area except for the inner suburbs of Sydney. People in the country cannot understand how this could possibly be, but the Doctors for the Bush Bill, which I introduced today, remedies this blatant unfairness by restoring the priority that country areas should have by legislating that Modified Monash Model areas MM 1 and MM 2 can't be classified as distribution priority areas. It will mean that country areas and country Australia once again has priority for international medical graduates. This restores the Distribution Priority Area system to that which existed before the last election. I would therefore expect that every single coalition MP would be lining up to support this bill. It will be very telling if they don't, and I would be very surprised and disappointed if their support isn't forthcoming.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the urgency of this matter, you only need to speak to the residents of the Calare electorate to hear what they have to say about the urgency of this issue. Carlo Nizeti writes:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A lack of consistent GP services has left many residents in distress. For example, some have shared their experiences on social media of running out of critical medications, such as thyroid medication, because local doctors are either unavailable or not accepting new patients. This level of neglect is putting lives at risk, and it is unacceptable in a country like Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This highlights the urgency of this matter and of addressing the rural doctor shortage crisis. There is a Change.org petition we have started, which already has 13,000 signatures or thereabouts, which basically calls on the government to end the rural doctor storage crisis. So this bill that I have put into the House today is very important, because it actually takes action to do something about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said to this House earlier today, it's predicted that, in Australia, we will be short 10,600 GPs by 2031. At the same time, demand for GP services is expected to increase by 58 per cent over the next decade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a fundamental unfairness and inequality in access to health services in this country. Out in the Central West of New South Wales, we call the Great Dividing Range the 'sandstone curtain', but it is a great divide in so many other ways as well. We need to actually take action, because the cold hard truth is that the further away you live from the city the shorter your life expectancy will be. That's the truth of the matter. With close to one-third of the Australian population living in the regions, how can this possibly be? The answer is simple: country people have less access to doctors, such as GPs, who are often the first point of contact when someone feels sick or has a health problem. This crisis is adding more strain onto an already overstretched hospital and emergency department system. We need to take action on it straightaway.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend this motion to the House, and I commend the Doctors for the Bush Bill 2024, to achieve better health outcomes for country patients. This situation is urgent. It's at crisis point, and it's critical that the House deals with this issue without delay.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:02</span>):  Yes, I second the motion. It's not entirely germane to what we are proposing here, but there were three Katter boys—my father and his two brothers. Their parents had gone out to their region in a stagecoach in the 1870s. Two of the boys died as a result of the tyranny of distance. My uncle was injured in a football match—and this is where the story does not really pertain to doctors in the bush. By the time the Qantas aeroplane—and my grandfather was a major shareholder in those days—came back from Longreach to Cloncurry and then took him from Cloncurry to Brisbane, it was too late. Sadly, he died. If the aeroplane had been at Cloncurry, he'd have been alright. So he died as a result of the tyranny of distance. My father had cancer. He should have gone down for the operation, but the airline strike came. He wouldn't jump the queue and he was in no condition to drive down. By the time he got down there, 3½ months later, it was too late; the cancer had got away. So he also died as a result of the tyranny of distance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are people dying every day in Australia because there is no local doctor. The actual statistics that were done some years ago indicated that, where you've got a thousand people in a town without a doctor, there will be a death once a year. So there's an actual figure that we can put upon this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The honourable member quite rightly pointed out, when he moved to call on this legislation, that—and I could not believe this—when the very special help was given to country areas to help them to attract doctors, that included Cairns! It's one of the most salubrious places in the world to live. And it's isolated? Heavens! If Cairns is isolated, God help the rest of Australia! The honourable member is pointing out that most of Sydney is in the same category as far western New South Wales. How can that be? The government, whatever government it was, with good intentions, moved the legislation, and some serious lobbying by vested interests got them to change the legislation. So the minister quite rightly brings his attention to bear upon this fact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For six or seven years of my life, I carried the names of six doctors around with me because, every time we lost a doctor in Julia Creek, I would ring up England or, I don't know, America. There was a place in the Middle East where a doctor was available. He's a good bloke. I had six doctors overseas that I could call to come in because I was determined that Julia Creek would not be without a doctor. Julia Creek had over a thousand people in those days and now it's got very much under a thousand people. One of the reasons people leave is that there are no doctors there. Yes, they send a doctor out for four or five days a week from Mount Isa or Townsville or somewhere, but that's not having a doctor there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In our day, though we didn't have many doctors coming through the Brisbane university, which was the only university in Queensland, those doctors were, for two years, bound to go where the government sent them if they wanted to become qualified to practise in Queensland. We should return to that. I wouldn't say for two years but I'd say for a year and a quarter. The government puts a million dollars into you. If you graduate as a doctor, the government has put a million dollars into making you a doctor, and it will give you the right to earn a squillion dollars a year. If you've got the right to practise as a doctor, you'll be a very rich person. If the government gives you that right and gives you a gift of a million dollars to get that right, then I think you owe something to the people of regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;">
                  </span>I say regional Australia because it's not just the Julia Creeks that we're talking about here. We're talking about the Mareebas. Mareeba's only 30 kilometres from Cairns, yet their situation is grim. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="248353" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms McBRIDE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Mental Health and Suicide Prevention and Assistant Minister for Rural and Regional Health</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:07</span>):  The government acknowledges the member for Calare's deep interest in this matter as we do the member for Kennedy's. In the member for Calare's community, he faces a challenge which many of us do: the need to attract and retain more doctors to deliver the quality, affordable health care that communities need and people deserve. I recall an MPI the member moved on this matter in May, and, following his question to the Minister for Health and Aged Care last week, a meeting has been scheduled for the member for Calare and Minister Butler, and I look forward to joining them for that important discussion. The government is keen to continue our constructive engagement with the member for Calare; however we will not be supporting this motion to suspend standing orders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Big challenges remain in getting enough doctors to communities which need them in the years ahead, and Minister Butler has repeatedly said that general practice has been his key focus under our strengthening Medicare agenda since we came to government. There are many initiatives working to support that, and I will go through just a few today: historic increases in the Medicare rebate and bulk-billing incentive deliberately designed to deliver the most support to rural and regional doctors; increased GP training through a college led training system and more Commonwealth supported places; $90 million to implement the recommendations of the Kruk review and make it easier to bring internationally trained doctors to Australia in a globally competitive market; and innovative models of care grants to support innovative team based approaches to primary care in rural settings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know these measures are beginning to work. The slide in bulk-billing has stopped, and rates are increasing, including in Calare, which is up to 81.8 per cent of consultations fully bulk-billed. GP training programs are fully subscribed for the first time in many years. GP morale is improving and more GPs are feeling valued in their specialisation and are importantly recommending it as a career to young doctors in training. This is from the RACGP's <span style="font-style:italic;">General practice: </span><span style="font-style:italic;">health of the nation</span> report.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we know there are also people living in regional and outer metropolitan areas who find it difficult to see a GP when they need one. The complexity of this challenge means we cannot equate morality with need, as has been common practice in the past, so our policy work is set out to fully understand these complexities and respond to them, in particular our distribution levers, GP incentives and scope-of-practice reviews. The government is considering each of the reviews and has committed to working with our key stakeholders in the response. Indeed, I was speaking last week with the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine and this morning with the incoming president—the new president—of the Royal Australian College of General Practice about them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the member for Kennedy, bulk-billing rates in Kennedy are up 4.1 per cent from November last year when the tripling of the bulk-billing incentive flowed—came into effect—to October this year. I thank you for the opportunity to visit in your community, including with your local GP. We are aware of the challenges facing the GP practice in Charters Towers and have ensured the Rural Workforce Agency and Primary Health Network are providing recruitment and business planning support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I extend the same offer to the member for Calare and other members with a keen interest in this work. We, as a government, are working determinedly to grow doctor numbers and take affordable health care back to every region in the country and will continue to do so through the many policy initiatives that I have mentioned. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SHARKIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:11</span>):  I remember when this went through back in 2022. I said at the time that this will have a huge effect on people who live in the regions and that is why we must debate this today. This decision by government has stripped doctors from the regions. It has made clinics close. It has meant that if you move into many parts of my electorate of Mayo, the local doctor surgery says, 'Our books are full and we're not taking you.' This was, I think, an incredibly callous thing to do to rural areas. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have said it before, but we have seen doctors coming from overseas, some of whom even had contracts at the time, who were going to go work in the regions but saw the change in rules and went, 'Great, I am going to go and work in the outer metropolitan areas or even, in some cases, in the inner metropolitan areas, and I am going to live in the city. I am going to live in the affluent suburbs'—I am talking about around South Australia—'and I will work out to those areas.' They are not going to the regions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I cannot think in my near nine years in this place of a decision by government that has had a more profound effect, negative profound effect, on people accessing health care in the regions. This was a terrible decision by government , so I absolutely support the member for Calare's work to call this on, to call for a suspension of standing orders, to deal with the distribution priority areas. Because in South Australia, we are looking at areas like Tea Tree Gully and Mitcham. The inner city, leafy suburb of Mitcham is considered a priority area and is taking doctors away from the bush. I have a rural electorate and an area that has remote medical needs—Kangaroo Island. My goodness, what must it be like if you are in Kimba or Port Lincoln or in the member for Kennedy's electorate? This was a terrible decision by government and must be reversed, so I absolutely support the motion of the member for Calare as seconded by the member for Kennedy because people can't get in to see a doctor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember at the time, when this went through, we had some people say, 'Oh, I can't get in to see the doctor until late in the afternoon or even the next day.' Try weeks, try months, or trying ringing the only doctor surgery within your area to be told they won't see you at all. We had an elderly lady who had just moved to the Goolwa area, on the south coast of my electorate, ring my office, pleading with us to try and help her find a doctor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They can't employ doctors from overseas because they all prefer to liver in the metropolitan areas. They all prefer to live in the cities, and it is this legislation the government put through that has made that possible. It has starved the bush of doctors and it was an unconscionable decision by government to do that.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:23</span>):  Four years ago, there was a proposal from the then coalition government to ban phones for people in migration detention. There was a public outcry about that bill, and rightly so, because it was saying to people who are in migration detention who, in many cases, have done nothing more than just come here seeking a better life for themselves and their families, 'You have no right to have some of the basic essentials of life, including things like a phone.' A phone allows people to contact those in the outside world, to get the support that they and their families needed and, in some instances, to report back on the torture that was taking place inside these immigration detention hellholes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You would have thought—and people said this at the time—that someone who has not been convicted of a crime and who has just been put in this inhumane system of mandatory detention shouldn't be stripped of their basic rights, including the right to have things like a phone, which is an essential now, for many people, to stay connected with the outside world, to stay connected with family and friends and to pass on critical news about what is happening to them and their life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a public outcry when the coalition tried to do this, and Labor joined in the outcry. We, the Greens, were there together with other members of the crossbench, saying, 'This is an inhumane bill and should be opposed.' Back then, when Labor were in opposition, they joined us—rightly so—in saying, 'There is no case for denying fundamental rights of communication to people who haven't even committed a crime and are just stuck in the legal limbo, in the hellhole, that is mandatory detention in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now that Labor is in government, they have the power to make some positive change and to improve the conditions of people who are stuck in these detention hellholes. Labor could work with the rest of parliament to give more human rights to people, to undo some of the damage that has been done by previous coalition governments over a decade. But when Labor is in power, and has the ability to make some positive change to support multicultural Australia and migrants, they instead turn around and attack them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a piece of legislation that not even the coalition would have been able to get through. This is worse than what the coalition had proposed, and it comes in a final week of parliament where it now seems that Labor is also wanting to re-enliven their Trump style travel ban, which has been stalled in this parliament, and to use this final week of parliament to work with Peter Dutton, the Leader of the Opposition, to attack migrants and refugees. This is a shameful way to end this parliamentary year. With Labor and Liberals joining together, it is a race to the bottom on migration in the lead-up to the election. This is extremely disturbing. I worry that this now gives us a taste of what the election campaign is going to look like. I am very distressed that we are about to enter another race to the bottom between Labor and Liberal to see who can attack refugees and migrants the most.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A few years ago, Labor were in here joining the rest of us pointing out that a bill like this was inhumane, cruel and could not be justified. Now, when they're sitting on the government benches, what do they do? They pass it. And it's even worse. Why, Labor, are you working with the Liberals to stoke fear and division in our community?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, the Migration Amendment (Prohibiting Items in Immigration Detention Facilities) Bill 2024, will have sweeping powers. It will allow the minister to determine whether a thing is a prohibited item in an immigration detention facility. That is the language: a 'thing'. If the minister thinks that this thing 'might be a risk to the health, safety or security of persons in the facility, or to the order of the facility', they can ban it. The bill explicitly says that mobile phones, SIM cards and any device that can connect to the internet can be determined to be prohibited things. How is it that something that is simply the ability to connect with the outside world is somehow a threat? It could only be considered a threat if Labor had something to hide about what is happening in these detention facilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is Labor now saying it is a threat for people who are stuck in these facilities to expose what is going on? Labor and Liberal are so fond of saying to everyone, when it comes to security legislation, that if you have nothing to hide, you shouldn't be concerned. Well, why is it that Labor and Liberal, when it comes to some scrutiny about how they are run these detention prisons, now say that it is a threat to let anyone talk about what is going on inside?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Think about the logic that is in this bill, which Labor and Liberal are now trying to rush through. On this logic, on the way they've drafted it, you could ban a toothbrush because it could be sharpened to a point. You could ban deodorant because it could be flammable in an aerosol can. That is what this bill allows. This bill, as I've said before, is almost exactly the same bill that Labor voted against in 2020, following a public outcry concerning government overreach and human rights violations. The Australian Human Rights Commission said at the time:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">No-one held in immigration detention has forfeited their human rights, and immigration detention must never be imposed as— </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:31</span>):  On Saturday, it was my great pleasure to attend the annual celebration of St Michael, at Debre Genet St Michael Ethiopian Orthodox Church. A very significant proportion of Melbourne's Ethiopian community identifies as Orthodox, and a massive crowd was in attendance on the weekend, despite temperatures soaring into the mid-30s.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge Father Melake Tsehay, who, along with other fathers and religious leaders, led much of the service. We were also in the presence of a senior member of the church visiting from Ethiopia. Haileluel Gebre-selassie OAM, who does so much for the broader community, was also a key part of the celebrations, and, indeed, of making them happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">St Michael is one of the most important figures in the Orthodox tradition. He is one of the archangels and symbolises the conquest of Satan and the dragon. He symbolises protection and healing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Ethiopian community in Victoria is the largest in Australia, with over 20,000 people claiming the ancestry. It is a young community, with over half under the age of 24, based on the last census.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most uplifting aspects of Saturday's celebration was the presence of numerous leaders from the Indian community, across Melbourne's west, to offer support. Events like that on Saturday offer an opportunity for people to come together to celebrate their faith, as well as to strengthen bonds across the community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Leichhardt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:33</span>):  Cairns Airport has been named the Major Airport of the Year at the Australian Airports Association National Airport Industry Awards for 2024. This marks the second year in a row that the Cairns Airport has received this prestigious recognition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year's award is particularly meaningful, as it recognises the airport's determination and resilience during an unprecedented flooding in December last year, following Cyclone Jasper. For the first time, floodwaters breached the airport's levee, forcing its closure and creating an enormous challenge for the team. Within two days, they'd pumped the water from the runway, cleared the debris and inspected critical infrastructure, allowing the airport to reopen and serve our region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Beyond the immediate recovery, Cairns Airport has continued to deliver significant international growth for our region. This achievement reflects the airport's commitment to innovation and resilience and its role as the key gateway to tropical North Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to commend the Cairns Airport's chief executive, Richard Barker, and his entire team for their unwavering dedication, their efforts during the flooding and their ongoing focus on excellence. They are certainly setting a very high benchmark in the aviation industry. Congratulations again for a job very well done.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McEwen</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  Last week, hundreds of kids descended on Maryborough in Victoria to put themselves and their vehicles to the test at the 2024 Energy Breakthrough. This edition continues the tradition of innovation, excellence and overcoming epic challenges. Since 1991, the Energy Breakthrough has provided opportunities for students, teachers, parents and local industry to work together to design and construct human-powered vehicles. The program is unique in that all teams must compete across three areas of assessment—design and construction, display and presentation—as well as doing trials. School groups work throughout the year to design, build and test machines with detailed specifications. In the A2 class, which is primary-school-aged students from schools with above 200 students, our Laurimar Primary School again took the chocolates, with Laurimar Phoenix taking out first place and delivering the Holy Grail of a 'three-peat'. The Laurimar Griffons finished seventh, and the Laurimar Dragons finished 10th. The Mernda Central College Samurais finished 19th, and the Spirit of Diamond Creek Primary School finished 30th. In the triathlon, New Gisborne Primary School finished eighth. In the energy efficiency vehicles pedal-electric, Mernda Central College finished first. With temperatures in the cars soaring up to 47 degrees during the 24-hour trial, it's a testament to the tenacity and spirit of these young people. They all enjoyed their custard showers afterwards—not sure how that'd go on such a hot day! This is a very special event that brings the whole state together for a great lot of fun and innovation.</span>

In my electorate of Bonner, we have over 40 schools, each dedicated to nurturing the many bright minds that call Bonner home. This year, I had the privilege of hosting over 20 students from across the electorate as part of my Bonner Youth Advisory Council, or BYAC for short. Each member has excelled in their schooling and extracurricular activities, and I applaud their commitment to our local community. One of these outstanding students is Araminta from Rochedale State High School, a driven young lady who cares deeply about our community. I was proud to recently present her speech on youth mental health as part of the Raise Our Voice Australia initiative. BYAC is a vital forum for me to engage with Bonner youth on the issues that matter most to them. Since I was first elected in 2004, it has been a platform for open, frank and meaningful conversations. I'm grateful to all the students who dedicated their time over the school holidays and weekends to participate in BYAC this year. These meetings have been invaluable in staying connected with students and in understanding the issues shaping our future leaders. I look forward to continued success in BYAC throughout 2025.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  Yesterday afternoon, a rugby game and other sports took place in Canberra. While we all love a Sunday arvo kick-around with mates, this game was more special than any other. The inaugural Jack Fitzgibbon trophy—here it is—was played between pollies and Defence to commemorate and honour a great Australian serviceman and the son of our former colleague and lifelong mate the Hon. Joel Fitzgibbon, the former defence minister. Jack Fitzgibbon was an outstanding young Australian who served his country with distinction. The Fitzgibbon family are justly proud of his accomplishments, as are his mates in the 2nd Commando Regiment. Yesterday, the Prime Minister attended with his good mate Joel Fitzgibbon and a roll call of former Wallabies, including Senator Pocock, Stephen Larkham and Ben Mowen, who all played, and Joe Roff was there as well. The member for Solomon and I laced up our boots and played on opposite sides in a fine spirit. We also raised $20,000 for the Commando Welfare Trust. Thanks, Andy Turnbull. The members of the Australian Defence Force do us proud every day. Events like yesterday's give us the opportunity to reflect on the sacrifices they and their families make. On behalf of the nation, we thank them sincerely. To Joel and Jack's family, we hope yesterday's rugby match is the first of an annual fixture—won by the pollies yesterday, as the member for Solomon would acknowledge—and we hope future games that honour Jack Fitzgibbon add to the memories that honour and give you some comfort as you grieve Jack. Lest we forget. I won't mention the score.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, or CSIRO, as it's more commonly known, delivers critical scientific research that serves the national interest and benefits the Australian community. This includes, of course, being a leader in climate change research, undeniably our biggest and most serious generational concern. Why then do we find ourselves again in the unfortunate position of CSIRO looking down the barrel of yet another round of job cuts, this time in the vicinity of 500 research support roles, likely including CSIRO staff in Tasmania? These cuts are on track to being the worst in the last decade. It's simply baffling that Australia can position itself as a global leader in scientific research while simultaneously gutting the capacity of CSIRO, in a trend of scarcity which began over a decade ago under the Abbott government and continues full steam ahead today. Yes, CSIRO staff have pleaded with Minister Husic to intervene but, sadly, it appears he has washed his hands of the process, deferring instead to the CSIRO board and chief executive.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government either has a pro-science agenda or it doesn't, and my interpretation of this latest round of cuts is that its priorities lay elsewhere. With climate change outpacing our capacity to adapt, the Australian community, both today and especially in the future, deserves much, much better.</span>

I and my colleagues on this side of the House believe that it's time to stop lower-paid workers being exploited by multinational companies like Amazon. Sadly, the race to the bottom on wages and secure jobs is a global problem, and Amazon is a prime example. It's real, and it's still happening here in Australia. This government's reforms to gig work, labour hire and casuals are important steps in addressing Amazon's exploitation of Australian workers, but there is still much more that needs to be done.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week, the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association, the Transport Workers Union and unions across the world are calling for an end to poor working conditions and low wages for Amazon workers. Amazon exploits its workers in Australia including by hiring warehouse staff as casuals and through labour hire and its delivery workers as gig workers, and by imposing punishing productivity targets and workplace surveillance. By ripping off workers and evading tax, Amazon undercuts good Australian businesses. As the union for Amazon online retail workers, the SDA is working tirelessly to stop the Americanisation of wages and working conditions in Australia. The TWU is working hard to provide safe standards for transport workers who deliver Amazon's goods to consumers. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

That idea of looking after the environment and looking after ourselves speaks so much to the care that is coming through, loudly and clearly, from our next generation. Akeer Adol wrote a wonderful letter that could have come off any regional kitchen table. She wrote, 'Something needs to be done about Australians in remote areas not being able to access internet or wi-fi because of costs or not knowing how to use it.' These are issues that are raised with me all the time in regional telecommunications forums. It's great to see such a switched-on young person raising these issues.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aya Doherty wrote a letter on homelessness that I think all of us will pause and think on. If you're in Toowoomba, watching the rates of homelessness increase and seeing people on the streets that have never been there before, you can only imagine what it must be like for a young person to see this change happen in their own city. She writes, very importantly, on the impact on youth crime that this has had in our area. The last one, from our Treasurer in training, Georgina Sullivan, is about the issue of inflation causing the cost of living to increase. I'll send you down a membership straightaway. Thank you very much, kids—a great school effort. </span>

This unique and powerful petition was conceived and produced by Hilary, inviting women and non-binary Australians to document and capture their perspectives on the climate crisis through compelling visual storytelling. The petition featured 1,248 striking and thought-provoking images that laid bare the profound impacts of climate change on our lives. Hilary's motivation was born out of a desire to transform feelings of helplessness into meaningful action, and, through her art, she inspired countless others to engage, reflect and act. The images she curated are not just visually stunning but also hauntingly poignant, offering a raw, unflinching look at the climate crisis we all face.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act 1998 currently prohibit the development of enrichment, fuel fabrication, and nuclear power plants in Australia. Nuclear power is a zero-emissions, baseload energy that must be part of Australia's energy mix to ensure Australians receive affordable and reliable electricity. </span>

                  </a>  Over 300 people within my electorate have signed a petition to remove the moratorium on nuclear power in Australia. This petition is a clear indication of the sentiments within Australia. Not everyone has bought the government's renewables-only energy policy. Most Australians recognise that, in order to have affordable, safe and reliable energy, we must have a constant base-load source of power that can replace outgoing traditional fossil fuel plants, and that is nuclear.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor would have you believe that nuclear is some fanciful pipedream, but this petition reveals that Australians don't think that that's the case. They recognise its invaluable role in our future energy mix. It doesn't mean we're opposed to renewables; it's not a binary choice. It simply means that we have to put our eggs in more than one energy future basket.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I call on the government to take heed of the wishes of 335 people in the Lyne electorate and start a conversation on the removal of the current prohibition on enrichment, fuel fabrication, and construction and operation of nuclear plants in Australia. The government's failure to even have a discussion on this matter is an affront to the Australian people, who hold very legitimate—<span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Today I want to read another of those speeches, this time from 13-year-old Ella, who has written about the important issue of sexual harassment in Australia:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Sexual harassment is a major issue and is largely overlooked.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Research has shown that young women are more likely to be to experience sexual harassment and stalking than older women or men.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The sexual violence statistics show that approximately one out of eight or 1.3 million Australian women have experienced sexual harassment in Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">As a young woman who has experienced sexual harassment, my greatest hope is that in 10 years, women feel comfortable and safe in the community but that can't happen if we don't come together as a nation and take action, now.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you for your speech, Ella. It is an important issue that we all must pay attention to. I have two young daughters myself, and I would hate for them to have to feel this way as well. We need to make sure we do our best to do what we need to do to make sure that women—and everybody else—are safe in our community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mitchell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  I rise today to express my deep concern since I last raised this topic: the Rouse Hill hospital and the New South Wales state government's failure to secure and fund a birth unit for a new public hospital in one of Sydney's fastest-growing areas. The north-west of Sydney has been doing the heavy lifting for growth. Indeed, the state government's new growth projections have doubled—or, in some cases, tripled—the number of dwellings that will be in place in what is the fastest-growth area not just in Sydney but in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last government—the coalition government—announced a new public hospital at Rouse Hill, affecting my electorate, the electorate of Greenway and all of north-west Sydney. It was a fantastic initiative, with $700 million to be spent. But the health minister in New South Wales has announced that, in one of the fastest-growth corridors in Australia, there'll be no maternity unit built at the new public hospital.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an absolute shambles. In fact, the private hospital that will be constructed across the road from the public hospital will have maternity facilities. If we're going to the trouble—and we are—of building a $700-million public hospital, how can we not have a maternity unit there?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on the NSW Labor state government to announce a fully funded public hospital maternity unit. Even if they don't want to do it now, think of the cost saving. If in 10 years they try and put this in, which they will have to anyway, it will cost five times as much. We need it now. It's the fastest-growing area of Sydney, and I call on the state Labor government to fully fund the Rouse Hill hospital.</span>

I had the privilege of meeting an amazing woman, Caitlin, who lives in the heart of Swan. She is a mum. She has a son and daughter just like me. She was part of a renters' delegation and was telling me about some of the challenges she had been experiencing. She had an amazing rental history, had had three successful two-year leases and was about to negotiate the next lease when the property manager turned, almost like a switch. They were like, 'We don't negotiate two-year leases.' Then she felt the tone of the relationship change. What she saw was a systematic approach to basically get her out of her home. When her lease ran out, they wanted to increase her rent by $190—pretty outrageous for a single mum. When she left, her neighbours cried; they had really strong relationships. The coalition government did not have a housing minister; we do. We are listening. We have a housing policy, and I would love to see the Help to Buy scheme bill actually pass in the Senate. Please listen. </span>

These are not my figures—they come from a lot of independent organisations—but the average family in Australia over the last 2.5 years is now $35,000 a year worse off than they previously were. Now, $20,000 of that increased cost, as you would understand, Deputy Speaker—as we would all understand—is the increase in mortgage costs on the average mortgage of an Australian family. The other $10,000 is an increase in groceries and energy bills. It has been the biggest fall in disposable income in over 60 years, all overseen by this hapless government.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What has the government been doing to correct this? Unfortunately, very little. In fact, they have made it a lot worse with some of their reckless spending—the water buybacks for the Murray-Darling Basin which made food and water more expensive—and with their reckless renewable energy policy that will make energy costs as well more expensive. They are focused on things like the Voice. They have been focused for the last week on things like the misinformation bill; they need to get back to focusing on the cost of living for Australian families. </span>

January is significant to Tamils worldwide as it marks Thai Pongal, the traditional four-day harvest festival that honours the sun, land, rain and agriculture. Recognising Tamil heritage month would celebrate a culture over 5,000 years old, providing younger generations with an opportunity to connect with their roots, and inviting the wider community to appreciate Tamil contributions to art, philosophy and language. It would also honour ancient Tamil works like the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tirukkural</span>, which continues to inspire us with its timeless insights into ethics, governance and human values. This recognition would highlight the contributions of Tamil Australians in fields like business, education and public service while fostering pride within the Tamil community. Tamil Heritage month would benefit local businesses. Grocery stores, restaurants and clothing shops, for example, would see increased activity as the community prepares for Pongal. Recent Tamil cultural festivals have drawn strong support, with thousands attending, showcasing the enthusiasm for cultural celebrations and the demand for a dedicated Tamil heritage month. This is an opportunity to celebrate Australia's rich multicultural tapestry, honour Tamil contributions and ensure the ongoing vibrancy of the Tamil community. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Road safety is everyone's responsibility and, as we approach the busy Christmas season, I urge all road users to consider their responsibilities and their own behaviour. In the same vein, I urge the Victorian government to consider its behaviour. Victoria is the state with the biggest budget blowouts and the biggest potholes in Australia, on our neglected regional road network.</span>

It's hard to believe that more three years ago I secured $10 million to upgrade Mallacoota-Genoa Road. Now, more than three years later, we've had consultation and money wasted on a whole bunch of reports, but not a single new piece of bitumen or improvements have been made to the road itself. Mallacoota-Genoa Road has not been touched after more than three years, and this government has failed to get the Victorian government to actually deliver on that $10 million.</span>

The north already does it tough, and that's without the cost-of-living and housing pressures we're currently seeing, so my constituents look to us in this place for support that they desperately need. And what are they getting in return? They're getting a Liberal-Greens coalition, the LNGP, which is trying its absolute hardest to prevent housing supply in this country. They're getting elected members doing everything they can to shoot down housing reform to keep costs high. They're getting Liberal and Green parties trying to make people suffer so they can become their saviours.</span>

Please come up to Darwin and check out the fantastic new lagoon pool that joins two great hotels into one beautiful, big Top End resort. This award recognises the innovative approach ADG undertook, delivering with minimal disruption. Well done to Tony and the team for your professionalism and efficiency.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now what we need to deliver are more competition and more seats in and out of Darwin to drive lower airfares for Territorians and tourists alike. Airfares are a glaring cost pressure for most families, especially as we approach the holiday season, and, of course, effect tourism. Our government has acted with the ACCC, with price and service monitoring and measures to reduce anticompetitive behaviour. We know that increased supply of seats drives lower airfares, and I'm working with proponents that want to make Darwin an even bigger regional and international aviation hub. We have some increased flights happening now to Singapore and to Melbourne so— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:01</span>):  Today, as we mark the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and the start of the 16 days of activism against gender based violence, we pause to remember all whose lives have been lost to domestic and family violence. We think of every woman robbed of the future she had every right to live. Every death is its own universe of devastation. We think of all who live or grow up in the shadow of violence. We think of those who live with abuse, with fear, and we think of all the First Nations women and children who have been murdered or who have disappeared. This is a stain upon the soul of our nation, and it cannot stand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all feel grief. We all feel anger, for all the stories we read on the front page and those that should be on the front page but are not. Rather than let this overwhelm us, we must be energised to keep acting and working for change. Since our very first day in government, we've been focused on ending gender based violence. We've put a particular focus on economic security so no woman has to choose between her safety and her financial security. We've acted to introduce paid domestic and family violence leave, expanded the single parenting payment and cost-of-living support and invested almost $1 billion to establish the leaving violence payment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're making major investments in crisis, transitional and social housing so women know they have a safe place to go, and our investment in the Housing Australia Future Fund will provide 4,000 social and affordable homes for women and children affected by family and domestic violence. We've strengthened the way the legal system responds to gendered violence. We've implemented all 55 recommendations of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report, and we are making the family law system safer. And we've sharpened our focus on prevention so we can end violence in a generation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year, I've called two National Cabinet meetings where we've concentrated on delivering much-needed funding for frontline specialists and legal services and strengthening our focus on high-risk perpetrators and serial offenders to stop violence from escalating and prevent homicides. I'd particularly like to acknowledge the hard work, the dedication and the courage of the Minister for Social Services, Amanda Rishworth, and the Assistant Minister for the Prevention of Family Violence, Justine Elliot. As Assistant Minister Elliot put it earlier this year, 'Fear of violence should not be a normal nor accepted part of womanhood.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been a year where I know many across the community have felt a sense of urgency, anger and frustration that 50 years after the first women's shelter opened in Australia we're still grappling with this challenge. It's been a year where we've had to renew our commitment, sharpen our focus on what more needs to be done and accelerate our action. We cannot be satisfied until women feel safe, until this is no longer an issue people need to mobilise in the streets about. But I do have hope that we can get there. All of us have to be part of the change. We can break the cycle but only together. I know we have what it takes, so let's keep working.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Farrer</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:04</span>):  I thank the Prime Minister for his words. We once again come to this place to recognise the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. As we do so, Australia continues to see unacceptably high numbers of women and girls being killed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to begin my remarks by talking about Isla Bell, because it is another shocking example of attacks that are occurring on Australian women and girls. Isla Bell was just 19 and had her whole life ahead of her. It is alleged that she was bashed to death in an apartment in Melbourne. Her body was loaded into a fridge and moved several times before being dumped. On the day that she should have been celebrating her 20th birthday, Isla Bell's body was being hidden from view by men seeking to hide their crimes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The sad fact is that these events—the killings of women and girls—have been a constant presence for as long as I can remember. Countless women and girls have been killed, attacked, coerced and manipulated. But today, thanks to the progress and sacrifice of so many women, and the efforts of men, too, we're talking about it openly and addressing it. Today we don't just condemn the violence; we go further and recommit ourselves to the aim of eliminating gender based violence, because we cannot and should not accept this violence, and today is about committing ourselves to that task.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that violence is at the end of a chain of events across someone's life. We know that, with the right decisions and the right interventions, we can break the chain of violence and save women and girls not only from the most extreme end of violence but also from disrespectful behaviour and coercion, and we know that, if we get this right, we will not only save women and girls from being killed but our society will be a safer, happier and healthier place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I join in supporting the words of the Prime Minister to mark International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. There is no excuse for violence against women and girls in Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">UN women's statistics show that one in three women experience violence in their lifetime. That is many of us in this chamber. We know that the health of Australian women and girls is absolutely critical to their overall wellbeing and ability to fully participate in society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Women should feel safe everywhere, always. They should feel safe in their homes, and, where matters of domestic violence arise, they should feel safe and supported in their decision-making, including when leaving a violent relationship. The 16 days of activism is a time to reflect on Australia's sobering statistics and renew our efforts to combat this awful scourge of violence. Over 60 women have lost their lives already this year to domestic violence—children left without mothers; family members without sisters; friends lost forever.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home state of New South Wales, the police are called to a family violence incident every four minutes. The rates of domestic violence related assault have risen by 6.5 per cent in the year to June 2024, and violence in the home takes up 60 per cent of a general duty police officer's time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to make this point, too: improving the safety of women and girls is above politics. It requires all levels of government, from all political persuasions, to continue to work together. The policy levers span across Commonwealth and state lines. We support many of the government's policies in this space and look forward to further announcements. We support a renewed focus on engaging with men and boys in violence prevention because we must see men and boys as part of the solution, not just part of the problem. The coalition will continue to work with the government and the sector to combat this scourge and help women and children escape the violence they are facing. I want to thank Senator Kerrynne Liddle and Senator Jacinta Price in the other place, and the member for Cowper in this place—all working hard and well in this cross-party effort.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the same way, we must all demand greater action. The government has a responsibility to Australians to get this right, and the opposition has a responsibility to hold the government accountable for its commitments. We will continue to ensure that policies are announced, implemented and delivered, to keep our women and children safe. Too many women have been killed as a result of violence in 2024. Too many others have been assaulted. And there is no excuse for violence against women and girls.</span>

The annual campaign, as we've heard, aims to bring together individuals and organisations around the world in the prevention of violence against women and girls. I invite all members to join me for the building illumination at 7.30.</span>

We passed legislation in this House for 43 per cent by 2030, opposed by those opposite, and net zero by 2050, opposed by those opposite. When we passed the 43 per cent by 2030, one of the provisions that was carried with amendments was that the Climate Change Authority had to give us advice about future targets. That is the law. That is the law. It was passed by this parliament; it was passed by both chambers. The Climate Change Authority gives us the advice based upon the science, and then we announce the target based upon the science consistent with getting to net zero by 2050. That's the process.</span>

The climate change minister will be giving his annual statement—again consistent with the legislation that was carried in this parliament. He will be giving that at the end of this week, but I'll give you a preview. We are on track for achieving the targets that we have established. Not only have we got a target, but we've also told you how we'll get there. We'll get there through the safeguard mechanism, firstly, taking the top emitters—</span>

The Prime Minister is being directly relevant. He wasn't asked about alternative approaches, he wasn't asked about alternative policies, he hasn't gone into that space. I will listen carefully to make sure he directly relevant, but he couldn't be more directly relevant if he is articulating why the government is pursuing what they're doing.</span>

We not only have a target of 43 per cent; we've told you how we'll get there. The safeguard mechanism on the top emitters is working, and the Capacity Investment Scheme is working even better than we envisaged. We have a plan. We have a process to get to that objective. Those opposite don't have a target for 2030, oppose net zero by 2050 and have a nuclear plan sometime in the 2040s and no idea how you keep reliability of energy supply in the meantime—none. They have no idea, no costings and no plan.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:15</span>):  I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. Of course, our No. 1 priority every day is relieving cost-of-living pressures. There are three key ways that we're doing that. We're getting wages up, which is opposed by those opposite, we're bringing costs down through our cost-of-living measures and we're getting inflation back to where it should be. We inherited inflation on the rise, with a six in front of it, and now it's going down, with a two in front of it. That is important. We know that housing is one of the big costs causing stress for Australians. Labor's Help to Buy program will help 40,000 Australians buy a home of their own—people who have worked hard and saved but still can't get a deposit. We're stepping up to help more Australians buy a home. We want to help with social housing through our Social Housing Accelerator and the Housing Australia Future Fund. We want to help renters through the increases that we've had in rental assistance. But we also want to help more people to buy their own home. Those opposite right across the board, both there and some down in the corner there are teaming up—the Liberals and the Greens—to get in the way. The clue as to why they oppose is in the title, 'Help to Buy'. It's because the Liberals never want to help and the Greens never want to buy. Australia's housing shortage didn't happen overnight. It took a decade of a coalition government that, for most of the time they were in office, didn't even bother to have a housing minister. But now they're still standing in the way, blocking help, playing politics instead of making progress and, in this case in the Senate, teaming up with the Greens political party. There will be a vote tomorrow in the Senate on the Help to Buy scheme, and that will be a test of whether the Greens political party will vote for something that's their policy and that they took to the election—a shared equity scheme. You can't actually build if you're just focused on protests and not focusing on progress. That is what we are doing. They see issues to campaign on; we see challenges to act on. Blocking bills in the Senate and blocking housing in your respective electorates helps no-one, so we think that this legislation should be carried. We're not waiting around for the Liberals and Greens, but it's a big test tomorrow in the other place to see whether the coalition continue to combine with the Greens to become the 'no-alition' in opposing good policy.</span>

You know, 'chutzpah' is a wonderful word, and we've seen a wonderful example of it from the opposition today, a party and a coalition which presided over 10 years of denial and delay, which had 23 energy policies and couldn't land one, which can't tell the Australian people what its 2030 target is let alone its 2035 target and which argues that renewable energy should be paused and that we should rely more on coal and gas while we wait decades for nuclear to come forward. They have the temerity to ask this government a question about our policies. We have legislated the Climate Change Act, we have legislated safeguard reforms and we have legislated new vehicle efficiency standards, which the member for Bradfield tried to do and got rolled by his cabinet. We have done what he couldn't deliver. He said he would reduce emissions, but he couldn't get it done. We have gotten it done, and we are continuing to get those things done.</span>

That's never the way question time has been run, and it's not going to run that way now. I like to give everyone a fair go. People are entitled to take a point of order, particularly for the high office that the manager holds. But that's just taking the mickey.

I look forward to the opposition's detailed policy response, which will outline, no doubt, the full costings of their nuclear plan and the emissions under their nuclear plan. I look forward to all those details from the opposition on Thursday. They have had plenty of opportunities.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hotham</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Housing and Minister for Homelessness</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:23</span>):  I thank the fantastic member for Macarthur for his question. It gives me a great opportunity to update the House on Labor's bold and ambitious housing agenda, an agenda that comes after a wasted decade under those opposite. As the Prime Minister reminds us, it was a decade for most of which those opposite did not even have a housing minister. That's how tapped out of this problem they were.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The election of our government changed that attitude. We have a Commonwealth government stepping up, leading the country and working with the states to get better housing options for Australians. We are working to get the country building more homes. We are getting a better deal for renters. Homeownership is a critical part of that agenda. In your electorate, Speaker, and in mine there are low- and middle-income Australians who have been locked out of the housing market, key workers who need and deserve government help to get into a home—childcare workers, teachers, nurses and cleaners. Labor's Help to Buy Bill is part of the puzzle in addressing this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm asked what stands in the way. What stands in the way is those opposite. They say no to everything. For every good thing our government is doing, there is nasty negativity and reckless opposition, and on housing it is no different. But the biggest hypocrites of all are the Greens. For everything our government has tried to do on housing this term—</span>

                  </a>  I will withdraw that if you like, absolutely. I withdraw. For everything our government has tried to do on housing this term, the Greens have worked in partnership with the opposition to block and delay. The net effect on housing of the Greens' presence in this parliament is thousands of Australians who have been denied a home and fewer homeowners. It is not a record that I would be particularly proud of.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They have a chance this week to redeem themselves by allowing our housing bills passage through the Senate, remembering that the Greens brought a scheme just like help to buy to their platform in the last election. We know that they support this scheme and the only reason that they have blocked and delayed homeownership for childcare workers and nurses is that, every time, the Greens choose politics over progress for Australians. It is time for this juvenile charade to come to an end.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before the Senate will help tens of thousands of low-income people, like nurses and childcare workers, into homeownership, and the Greens must stop working with those opposite to deny these people those opportunities. Australians will remember the actions of the Greens this week on the housing bills. Do the Greens want to go into the election having blocked and delayed everything and having stood in the path of childcare workers owning their own homes? Are they anything more than an ineffective party of protest? We will soon find out. The ball is in their court.</span>

A recent review found that major supermarkets are in some cases charging more for unpackaged fruit and vegetables than they are for plastic wrapped produce. One example was loose potatoes which cost 53 per cent more than bagged ones. With Australians already struggling with the cost-of-living crisis and some really trying to do the right thing by reducing their plastic waste, how is the government going to hold supermarket chains accountable for fuelling Australia's plastic pollution?</span>

The supermarkets have been much too slow in reinitiating the collection of soft plastics at supermarkets. We're continuing work on the supermarkets to roll out the collection of soft plastics again. We are opening soft-plastics-recycling facilities, including for those very difficult plastics like food packaging to be recycled. In fact, the member for Adelaide, in his electorate, has recently seen the opening of a new soft-plastics-recycling facility, one of 60 soft-plastics-recycling facilities that we've rolled out across the country as part of our billion-dollar investment in upgrading recycling facilities across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also, of course, working with state and territory governments on packaging regulation. We need to create less of this waste in the first place. We need to make sure we're making demands on packaging makers like upping the level of recycled content in packaging, reducing unnecessary packaging and getting rid of those particularly bad additives. Of course, we're also banning the import or severely restricting the use of around 500 of the PFAS group of chemicals from 1 July. Again, that'll make a huge difference on this side.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And we're working internationally, because, of course, this is an international problem. We're working with countries in our neighbourhood, like East Timor and Indonesia, to deal with issues like the ghost nets and the ocean plastics that are washing down from our neighbourhood. We're working to take those plastics out of the ocean. Right now—today, in fact—negotiation on the global plastics treaty has started in Busan. This is the final stage of the negotiation. Australia has been advocating very strongly for an ambitious treaty that restricts the production of new plastic and focuses much more on recycling the plastic that we already have in circulation globally.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are absolutely determined to reduce the amount of plastics being used. It's such a shame that those opposite teamed up with the Greens in the Senate to disallow amendments to the cost of licences to export our waste overseas. It was your policy when you were the minister. Why would you disallow it?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:32</span>):  Thank you to the member for Paterson for always maintaining a focus on the main game, which is the cost of living. The member for Paterson knows that, when we came to office, Australians were going backwards, and that's because inflation was higher and rising; wages were lower and real wages were falling, quarter after quarter; and there were huge deficits and enormous debt. All of that together meant that Australian living standards were falling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that people are under pressure. We know that people have got a lot of ground to make up in their household budgets. That's why it's our primary focus on this side of the House, and we have made some good, substantial progress. Inflation is now less than half what we inherited—it's back in the Reserve Bank's target band—and real wages have grown now for four quarters in a row. We'll get some monthly inflation data on Wednesday. That monthly number bounces around a bit, but really anything with a 2 in front of it will show the kind of progress we've made, since it was north of six per cent under those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the good progress we're making in the national numbers, we know that that doesn't always automatically translate to how people are faring or feeling in the economy. We know that it's not mission accomplished, because people are still under pressure. That's why our cost-of-living help is so important—getting inflation down, getting wages up, tax cuts, energy bill relief, rent assistance, cheaper medicines and cheaper early childhood education. We've done that at the same time as we've delivered a million jobs and delivered two surpluses in two years, when those opposite couldn't deliver a single surplus in nine years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Worse than that, those opposite, when they had the opportunity to support cost-of-living help, couldn't bring themselves to do it. Because they opposed cost-of-living help, it means that people would be much worse off today if those opposite had their way. On this side of the House, we've come at the cost-of-living challenge from every responsible angle, and at every single turn those opposite have argued for and voted for lower wages and less cost-of-living help. That means that people would be worse off today if they had had their way. This is the risk they pose, because this is their record. They left behind higher inflation, falling real wages, and more deficits and debt, and we have been working around the clock to turn that around. Those opposite are a risk to the progress that we have made, because of that record of coming after wages, cutting Medicare and rorting the budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the House we know Australians are under pressure but, more than acknowledging that, we are actually doing something about it. What that means is Australians would be worse off without our cost-of-living help and they would be much worse off under those opposite. The biggest risk to household budgets is a coalition government. This is why they haven't come clean on any alternatives, because the alternative over there is more inflation, lower wages and less help.</span>

We are talking about a plan to go forward, as the world is. That plan is being driven by renewables and the shift that's happening with the transition to clean energy. That is what is happening. That's why the world last year added 460 gigawatts of new non-hydro renewables, while nuclear energy generation went backwards by one gigawatt. The United States added 39 gigawatts of new renewables last year and no nuclear. Last year, China added 217 gigawatts of new renewables and only one gigawatt of new nuclear. The reason why the world is transitioning to clean energy is because its leaders understand not only is that good for the environment, it's also good for their economies. That is why Australia is a part of that global transition that's occurring. Those opposite want to press the pause button, don't have any plan for between now and 2040s and won't tell us how much their plan that will contribute some four per cent of our energy needs in the 2040s will cost. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr BURKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Watson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for the Arts, Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Cyber Security, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:39</span>):  I thank the member for Blair for the question and for his fierce commitment to getting wages moving in Australia. This government is committed to lifting wages, to fighting inflation, to strengthening Medicare and to building more houses. Those opposite, throughout all of the arguments we've had with respect to lifting wages, have opposed it every single time—right from the election campaign, when the Prime Minister was asked whether or not wages should keep up with inflation and he answered with one word, which was, 'Absolutely.' When those opposite heard it, they thought it was a mistake. They couldn't picture the concept of conviction for working people. They had no way of handling it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They then came up with their different arguments when we introduced the legislation to get wages moving. Firstly they claimed it would be inflationary and yet, while wages have been rising, inflation has halved. They then claimed there'd be crippling economy-wide strikes. Strikes are now running at one-sixth the rate they were under the previous government. That's right: in the final quarter for the previous government, the number of days lost to industrial action was six times higher than it is now. So why would it be that they voted against pay rises for Australian workers 48 times? Why would it be that they have done that? Why would it be that they are so committed to opposing the concept of people earning more and keeping what they earn? They've done it every single time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our approach to the minimum wage, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Annual Wage Review</span>, has been to go in every time and argue for wages to be improved so that people don't go backwards. We have done it every single time. They had a complete opposition to that approach; instead their approach was for low wage growth to be a deliberate design feature of their economic management, and they delivered it. Successfully, for a decade, wages flatlined. As a result of the changes of policy of this Prime Minister and as a result of the changes of law of this government, what have been the outcomes? The minimum wage over the three annual wage reviews has now gone up by 18½ per cent in the life of this government—that's the people who are the lowest paid in Australia earning $7,451 extra a year. Those on award wages have had a 14.8 per cent increase over the life of this government. Aged-care workers have had a 15 per cent increase, opposed by those opposite. Early educators have had a 15 per cent increase, opposed by those opposite. The gender pay gap is at the lowest level it's ever been since records began because of legislation opposed by those opposite. Mineworkers, cabin crew and meatworkers are all earning more and keeping more of what they earn.</span>

That's why we've delivered two rounds of energy bill relief to small businesses, opposed by those opposite—opposed by the member for Lindsay. Two successive budgets delivered energy bill relief not only for households but for small businesses. That's because when we say, 'Small business is the engine room of our economy,' we mean it and we deliver for them. All they deliver are slogans, platitudes and contempt for small business.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lilley</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Aged Care and Minister for Sport</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:45</span>):  I thank the member Dunkley for her question and for her advocacy for older people in her beautiful part of the world. Since the election of the Albanese government, we have worked relentlessly to fulfil the mandate required by the royal commission to restore dignity and quality to aged care. There is now a registered nurse on site in aged care 99 per cent of the time. Older Australians are receiving an additional 3.9 million minutes of care every single day. So far, 136 of the 148 recommendations of the royal commission have been directly addressed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today marks the passage of the most impactful aged-care reforms in 30 years. Today our rights based Aged Care Bill passed the parliament, creating a law that puts older people, and not providers, back at the heart of aged care. Older Australians will receive compassionate and person-centred care delivered by skilled workers who are respected and fairly paid. The aged-care system will be sustainable, with those who can afford it making contributions towards the cost of their own care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to share with this chamber a story about a duo, Joan and Michelle, who exemplify exactly what these reforms are about. Michelle is a personal care worker on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland. She is one of the 250,000 aged-care workers who received a pay rise and a tax cut from the Albanese Labor government. Through our fee-free TAFE, Michelle is now doing a diploma of nursing to further her career and become an enrolled nurse. Michelle supports Joan, a 96-year-old pensioner and home-care recipient.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Joan and her husband John lived and worked in Avondale, raising their family of 10. After her kids left the nest to have families of their own and her husband, John, passed away, Joan moved to a retirement village in Nambour. Like a growing number of Australians, Joan wants to live in her own home for the rest of our life. Under Support at Home, that will now be possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Support at Home will ensure Joan has faster access to assistive technology like walkers or wheelchairs, and it will increase the maximum level of support from $61,000 to $78,000. Support at Home will offer a temporary boost in funding that will be available to Joan if she has an accident or needs restorative and allied health support. This is how the Albanese Labor government's once-in-a-generation aged-care reforms are improving the lives of older Australians and the people who care for them.</span>

The answer to his question is zero. Last week the government was requested by other governments to enter into certain agreements and arrangements, which we did agree to. We joined, for example, the Global Energy Storage and Grids Pledge, which is a very good thing to do. We joined the call to action for no new coal, at the request and suggestion of the United Kingdom government, and we signed the Australia-UK Climate and Energy Partnership. After I signed that with Secretary of State Miliband, he said:</span>

After I signed the agreement with the United Kingdom, the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, Ed Miliband, said to the media, 'In Britain, we so admire what Australia is doing on renewables, the drive this government has shown, and we want to learn from Australia in terms of solar, for example.' That's what the secretary of energy in the United Kingdom said. It also followed the agreement signed by the prime ministers of Australia and India for closer cooperation in that most important economy when it comes to not only economic matters but the world's transition—because we work with governments across the board on renewable energy agreements that those opposite will not be able to sign and enter into. The member for Fairfax implies that there was a cost. There was zero cost.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr CLARE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blaxland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Education</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:51</span>):  I thank my friend, the cracking Government Whip, for his question—see what I did there? Last week, the ACT became the fourth jurisdiction to sign on to the Better and Fairer Schools Agreement, following Western Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory. That means more funding for public schools, including $256 million more for ACT public schools over the next 10 years. That extra funding will start to roll out from January, in just over a month's time. But, as I've said before, this is not a blank cheque. That money will be tied to real and practical reforms to help children who fall behind when they're little to catch up and to keep up and to help more young people finish school. This week, the Senate will debate legislation that we have to pass to make this happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, the Senate is also debating legislation to create, for the first time, paid prac. That's financial support for teaching students, nursing students, midwifery students and social work students while they do the practical part of their degree. These are the people who have signed up to do some of the most important jobs in this country—people who teach our children, look after us when we're sick or when we're old, or look after women in domestic violence refuges.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That same legislation will wipe $3 billion of student debt for more than three million Australians. It'll mean that someone with an average student debt today of about 27 grand will have their debt cut, when that legislation passes, by about $1,200. That's just the first step. If we win the next election, we'll wipe a further 20 per cent off all student debts. Combined, these two reforms will mean that, for someone with that average student debt of about 27 grand, we will wipe $7,000 from their debt. That's real help for a lot of young Australians, just out of uni, just out of TAFE, just out of home and just getting started.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What does the Liberal Party think of all of this? They say that it's a terrible thing to do. They attack a 15 per cent pay rise for childcare workers. They attack extra money for public schools. They attack making TAFE free. They attack making university degrees cheaper. I've heard more 'noes' and drivel and less sense from the Liberal Party in the last week than I have from my three-year-old. This reckless and arrogant Liberal Party seems to not understand the power of education or what it can do, but we do and so do the Australian people.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been a flood of grief in your local community, where both young women were so widely admired and well liked. They were best friends, and the best days of their lives should have been ahead of them. I know all Australians are at this moment thinking of their families, who are facing a grief which is every parent's worst nightmare. There's no crueller arithmetic than adding up all the years not lived, the potential not fulfilled, the dreams not lived—all that might have been.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">My government continues to support Holly's and Bianca's families, just as we continue our efforts with local authorities on investigations into this tragedy. Our officials are working closely with Bianca's and Holly's families to bring them home. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has been in direct contact with her Thai and Laos counterparts. Minister Wong has underscored our expectation that the investigations are thorough and transparent. Australian officials in Laos and Thailand are working closely with local authorities, including offering assistance in relation to the investigation that's underway. That includes, I can confirm, an offer of assistance from the Australian Federal Police.</span>

We'll also examine how these tragic incidents, which have affected so many, can be averted in the future. We want to work with other governments based upon this experience to see whether any action can be taken.</span>

I undertake to certainly keep the member for Goldstein informed as these investigations progress and also to work across the parliament. This isn't a party-political issue. If it can be averted, we should be a part of any action that could do just that.</span>

This fits in with the fourth of those issues that I referred to before: the government's determination to lift wages, to fight inflation, to strengthen Medicare and to improve access to housing. I think we were all a little bit astonished last week when we discovered that the opposition would be opposing a measure that the Leader of the Opposition, and the opposition generally, had connected to improving access to housing—that is, starting to hold back the net overseas migration numbers, particularly with respect to student visas. We discovered that the opposition would be opposing it notwithstanding that they had called for it and opposing it notwithstanding that they had welcomed it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Aston asks if there's a pattern here. I think there might be. Yes, they said they wanted to fix the migration system. Yes, they said that international students are overstaying visas. They describe that as a modern version of boat arrivals. Yet they ended up voting against the government having the power to put caps in place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's part of the pattern of reckless arrogance that we see from those opposite. There are policies like one I referred to before, where they are up-front and opposed to it. When they give all the speeches opposed to wage rises, we know they are going to vote against wage rises. The other half is, if they give speeches in support of something, they are going to vote against that too. It's been fairly consistent the whole way through. They said they cared about the housing crisis, but they voted against every single measure to build more houses. They said they cared about the cost of living, but when cheaper medicines were put in place, what did they do? They voted no. They said they cared about energy bill relief, but when energy bill relief was put in front of them, what did they do? They voted no. They said they cared about getting the skills there for people in the trades to be able to build more homes, but what did they do when we brought forward free TAFE? They voted no. They gave speeches about young people being in debt, but what did they do when there was legislation brought in by the education minister that's about reducing student debt? They voted no to it. What do they do when it comes to each issue here, particularly—of all the ones—migration? When there is something to contain migration, it doesn't matter how many speeches they have delivered about it; they vote no.</span>

South Australian Rick Wahlheim lost both his legs to diabetes and now relies on electricity powered devices, including his motorised wheelchair. His wife Lyn said that without power, they can't lift him out of bed. Their electricity bills have increased from around $900 to $1,400.

Not once but twice he voted against energy bill relief. I hope that the member for Sturt, whose electorate I was in just a few weeks ago, launching our education policy to take money off the debt of young Australians with HECS, has told his constituent and indeed all of his constituents that, firstly, they concealed a 20 per cent rise in their electricity bills. That was before the election, and, indeed, the member for Hume introduced a special regulation to make sure that that was hidden from the constituents in Sturt.</span>

I hope that the member for Sturt has told his constituent, as well, that when this government worked with state and territory governments to put caps on coal and gas prices, with support for rebates for households and businesses as part of that plan, he voted against it. He didn't want it. He regarded that as an intervention into the market that was unnecessary, even though that global spike in prices was having an impact. I know that Claire Clutterham will certainly be telling the member for Sturt's constituents that his party's policy is to invest unknown billions of their taxpayer dollars in publicly owned nuclear reactors sometime in the 2040s and, between time, there's no plan whatsoever to ensure security of energy supply.</span>

The Albanese government has introduced world-leading legislation to establish a minimum age of 16 years for social media. We acknowledge that this is complex and novel reform. As the government has outlined, this bill is about supporting parents and protecting children, and it's about making sure children have a childhood and parents have peace of mind. It's also about the parliament working together to progress important reforms that will set a new community standard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can assure the House this legislation is centred on the key principle that supports parents to say no. This is a powerful reference point for society. It also centres on the principle of protecting young people, not isolating them. Social media in its current form is not a safe product for them. Access to social media does not have to be the defining feature of growing up. There is more to life than constant notifications, endless scrolling and pressure to conform to the false and unrealistic perfectionism that can be served up by influencers. Social media is having a detrimental impact on our young people and their mental health, and that is why we are acting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important that we support young people and their digital inclusion. The legislation before the parliament and its associated rules will exclude messaging, gaming, educational and health support apps from the age limit. Examples of excluded services include but are not limited to Google Classroom, the Kids Helpline social platform, ReachOut's PeerChat, and YouTube.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In protecting children, the legislation features stronger-than-typical data and privacy protections. Platforms will be required to ring-fence and destroy data collected for the purpose of age assurance when the age assurance check is complete. Not destroying data would be a breach of the Privacy Act, with penalties of up to $50 million. And we have made clear the Digital ID framework is not in scope and would not be used for age assurance. The government is also providing additional resources to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner to ensure it's equipped to oversee this legislation as it relates to privacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation will deliver greater protections for young Australians during critical stages of their development. It places the onus on social media platforms, not parents and not young people, to take reasonable steps to ensure these protections are in place. I welcome the prompt review of this bill by the Senate committee. I look forward to its assessment, and we will consider further steps in response that the bill should take in the protection of Australian children.</span>

Australians are the biggest per capita losers on gambling. Eighteen months ago, Peta Murphy's review recommended a ban on online gambling, and this is widely supported in my electorate, including by a mum I met in Kings Cross who is working as a cleaner and is desperate to help her son escape online gambling and the damage it has done to their family.

We've done more in two years to tackle gambling harms than has been done by any government since Federation. We've also made it very clear that the status quo is untenable, but we continue to engage with stakeholders on our response to what is an important issue. We have established a mandatory customer ID verification for online wagering. We have banned the use of credit cards for online wagering. We have forced online wagering companies to send their customers monthly activity statements outlining wins and losses. We have introduced new evidence based taglines in wagering advertising. We have provided direct funding for specialist financial counselling to support people affected by problem gambling. We have introduced nationally consistent staff training.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The production tax credits for critical minerals are the biggest investment any government in this country has ever made in the resources sector. The Treasurer this morning introduced the 10 per cent tax credit for processing critical minerals that will create highly paid jobs, good jobs and wealth for future generations of Australians. Industry was active in its development and, indeed, that's why industry has lined up to support it. I remind everyone here of the support we have from the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies. The CEO, Warren Pearce, has said:</span>

It is the members of the opposition, the coalition—the Liberal and National parties—standing in the way of jobs in this country—of jobs in their communities. On budget night, the member for Hume thought he was onto a winner with a new three-word slogan when he set out to oppose the production tax incentives. The coalition have voted against tax cuts, against energy relief, against cheaper medicines and against higher wages, and now it's the resources sector's turn to cop the reckless thoughtlessness of the modern Liberal and National parties. By their words and deeds in opposing this support for the critical minerals industry, the coalition are showing themselves for exactly what they are: anti Western Australian, anti Queensland and anti jobs in communities right through your electorates. They are anti resources, and they will pay a price. I say to the opposition: why don't you support production tax credits for critical minerals? It's because you are anti resources. </span>

                  <a href="53517" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">The SPEAKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">15:13</span>):  Last Wednesday, the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government and member for Ballarat raised, as a matter of privilege, whether an action by the member for Barker constitutes a breach of privilege. The specific action the minister referred to is the filming by a staff member of the member for Barker, without permission, of an interaction that day between the member for Barker and the member in her ministerial office, and associated filming in a Ministerial Wing corridor. The minister presented, as supporting information, an email from her to all members and senators advertising a drop-in session in her office on Wednesday, which I understand is a regular occurrence and I believe she should be commended for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have had the opportunity to review the matter raised by the minister and, as I noted at that time, I accept the matter was raised at the earliest opportunity. The task for me under the standing orders is to determine whether there is a prima facie case that the action by the member for Barker amounts to, or was intended or likely to amount to, an improper interference with the free exercise by the member for Ballarat of her duties as a member.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that the incident complained of occurred during a drop-in session held by the member in her capacity as Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, on subjects within her ministerial responsibilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I appreciate the minister's concerns about the discourtesy shown by the member for Barker through this action and acknowledge that she may consider it to be a significant interference in her ministerial work and an affront to her. However, I do not see evidence that the action by the member for Barker amounts to, or was intended or was likely to amount to, an improper interference with the free exercise by the member for Ballarat of her duties as a member, such as would allow me to find a prime facie case of a breach of parliamentary privilege. Therefore I do not propose to give precedence to a motion to refer the matter to the Standing Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even though there is not a prima facie case of a breach of privilege, other considerations are relevant in these circumstances. The evidence of the minister raises serious concerns about breaches of the media rules applying to everyone in Parliament House. I take this opportunity to remind all members that filming interactions in the private areas of Parliament House without appropriate approvals and the express permission of those captured in the images are a breach of the media rules of Parliament House. These rules apply to everyone—visitors and building occupants alike—including members and their staff. I consider it to be the responsibility of members to ensure that their staff follow these rules.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, I take this opportunity to remind members of the parliamentary behaviour standards and code, which were approved by the House and the Senate in October. Every one of us is required to understand and comply with the standards and code. As the Behaviour Code for Australian Parliamentarians states, all parliamentarians have a shared responsibility as employers and leaders in the community to ensure that our workplace meets the highest standards of integrity, dignity, safety and mutual respect. I would hope that any member who has caused offence to another member would exercise that respect and apologise for their actions.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:16</span>):  on indulgence—Thank you, Mr Speaker, for this indulgence and for the manner in which you've dealt with this matter. Over the course of Wednesday 20 November, a new staff member from my office recorded footage of me in various locations in and around Parliament House, including in the ministerial corridor. These recordings, while taken in error, were in no way covert. I acknowledge the error. I note that I've apologised to you and, through you, to all occupants of this building for those actions. I have now refamiliarised myself with the rules for media related activities in Parliament House and its precincts and have, as requested, brought those media rules to the attention of all of my staff.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note, however, that, in raising this matter pursuant to standing order 51, Minister King has alleged amongst other things that I filmed in her ministerial suite and that I downloaded the footage onto a laptop. I reject those allegations. Unbeknownst to me, after capturing footage in the ministerial corridor, my staff member continued recording as I entered the reception and meeting room of the minister's suite. On returning to my office and having been made aware of that footage, the member of my staff was directed to delete it. That fact was contemporaneously confirmed when the Deputy Serjeant-at-Arms spoke with my staff member who apologised, accepted responsibility and confirmed that the footage had been deleted.</span>

As you know, the matter does relate to an incident that occurred in my ministerial office last week during a drop-in session, which I do hold on a regular basis for all members of parliament, regardless of political persuasion, to come and talk to me about projects that they have in their electorates. It's something that I feel is in the legacy of Simon Crean. He used to do that when we were last in government, and I've continued that tradition.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've already outlined to the House, I do consider it was a significant breach of the rules, during the drop-in session, when it did become evident that there was filming taking place without any prior request or any consent from me. I accept that the member for Barker subsequently rang me to apologise. I accept the apology, which I note has been made on behalf of his staff member. If that's how he'd like to explain it, then that is a matter for him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to make the point that, in the last week of the parliamentary calendar, Australians do expect and deserve to see parliamentarians conduct themselves in a manner befitting this place. That goes to respect for each other and for the rules we've established as we go about our jobs. We've now codified that behaviour, and I do hope that the member reflects on that, as he goes forward, in doing his job.</span>

But the brutal mathematical fact is that my margin sits on 0.9 per cent, or 1,344 votes. It's a margin significantly slimmer than me! My heart tells me that I've worked hard, that I'm well liked and that I can definitely retain this seat. But my professional, political brain tells me that the seat is on a knife edge, that Lyons is exactly the sort of seat the opposition leader is targeting and that, while I'm a hardworking member, I'm not a terrific campaigner. At elections, seats can and do change hands, despite the incumbents' self-belief and best efforts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, when the potential arose for another Labor candidate to emerge, my good friend Rebecca White, the former Leader of the Tasmanian Labor Party and a state member for Lyons—I won't go into the detail of Tasmania's Hare-Clark—the opportunity was too good to pass up. I've quipped with a few people over the recent weeks that, if I'd been on the preselection panel and had to choose between White and Mitchell, I'd have voted for White too—and I'm Mitchell! I am confident that Rebecca will be the new member for Lyons, and she will be a great addition to the caucus, to this parliament and to this nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I cast my eye around this caucus, I see an incredible bunch of people from all walks of life. We have dairy farmers, miners, teachers, factory workers, academics, police officers, lawyers, engineers, doctors, nurses, journalists, social workers, allied health workers, soldiers and a sprinkling of trade union officials. A majority of those in our ranks are women, and we have MPs from all walks of life and multicultural, linguistic and faith backgrounds. I am proud—enormously proud—to be part of a federal Labor caucus that reflects the diversity of the Australian population better than any caucus—or, indeed, any government—has in our nation's history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This group of people I've had the privilege to serve alongside is passionate and committed. In conversations and meetings, all the talk is about how we can do things to make life better for the people we represent. I've never had a Labor minister turn me away or be dismissive of my concerns, and I've been struck often by the compassion and the care shown by members of this group and, indeed, by members of this parliament towards each other when someone is having a tough time—especially when a loved one has died or a member has had a rough trot in the media. This is a group of people that care about each other, and that's reflective of how this group cares about its communities and the nation as a whole. Amongst this group is a new generation of Australian political leadership, and I leave this place knowing the country is in good hands, with people of this calibre to carry the torch. I will miss being part of this very fine group of Australians. I consider myself privileged to have been amongst you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many things I wish I'd further progressed before leaving this place, but there are three in particular that I will mention. First is the need for government to take a much more active role in the preservation and propagation of quality journalism. Quality journalism is increasingly replaced by clickbait because that's what drives eyeballs to advertisers who have stuck with legacy media. I do take my hat off to the efforts of the communications minister, who's worked so hard in this space. Organs dedication to quality journalism struggle because they don't get the critical advertising mass they need to pay the bills. Increasingly, the only people accessing quality journalism are those who care enough to pay for it via subscriptions, and that makes it a niche and boutique proposition. The people who most need access to quality journalism simply aren't being exposed to enough of it. If we really believe that all Australians deserve access to quality journalism, which provides them with the information they need to make informed judgements, it's going to have to be publicly funded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the Treasurer and the finance minister have conniptions, I think it can be done without adding too much to current expenditure. One model is to guarantee a minimum level of government advertising and sponsorship in established media, especially regional and independently owned newspapers, TV and radio, that can demonstrate genuine newsroom bona fides. It shouldn't end up costing the budget much more than is currently spent on a myriad of government information campaigns and job ads already in circulation. But it will mean a dedicated effort to redirect advertising resources towards the primary goals of supporting quality journalism and diverse media ownership, rather than simply dumping advertising dollars with the big corporates and platforms that do not offer journalism. It won't be easy. Guardrails will be required, and any regime will have to be adaptable to changing technologies and practices. But we simply cannot leave journalism to the crippling brutalities of market forces. As a nation, we acknowledge that justice and defence require substantial government expenditure; we don't expect them to survive in the market. We must acknowledge journalism's role as a cornerstone of our democracy, just as justice and defence are. It's too precious to allowed to crumble.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another issue I would have liked to have pursued—and the Treasurer will get nervous here—is getting more dental and mental in Medicare. I acknowledge the incredible leadership of the health minister, who has done so much in three years to repair the damage done to Medicare over the previous nine. He really has done a magnificent job creating Medicare urgent care clinics and improving bulk-billing rates, but I would love to see more mental and dental in Medicare firmly on the Labor agenda.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The wonderful Carmen Lawrence got dental care into Medicare in the dying days of the Keating government, but it was promptly ripped out like a healthy tooth by John Howard, and there have being no serious attempts since to restore it. I have no illusions about the expense or the difficulty, but it's time to commit to starting a process. Too many people, our people—the old, the sick, the poor—are suffering from poor dental and mental health for us not to turn our attention to it. In the words of the great late JFK, we do these things 'not because they are easy but because they are hard'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One last thing for the Treasurer to crack a smile about is I would love to see some far-reaching reform on the taxation of alcohol. As you know, I'm the co-convener on the Parliamentary Friends of Australian Spirits group, which I started not least because there are nearly as many distilleries in Tasmania as there are in Scotland. There are some deeply ingrained inconsistencies and injustices in the way alcohol taxes and excises are levied, and we do need some serious reform there to both create a level playing field in Australia amongst distillers, brewers and vintners and make Australian spirits more competitive in the global market. The budget might take a hit in the short term by getting few dollars per litre of spirits sold, but I do think it would make more over the long term by growing the pie overall. Distilleries, and for that matter breweries and wineries, are terrific employers and generators of economic activity across regional Australia, and we should not underestimate their significance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue that keeps me awake at night—other than all known life in the universe being reliant on a thin strip of atmospheric gas separating us from the infinite vacuum of space; believe me, it keeps me awake!—is the rise, and this is serious, of the extreme political Right across western democracies and the rapid mainstreaming of fascism. What was unthinkable 10 years ago is accepted now and will be firmly entrenched tomorrow unless we do more to prevent it taking root, particularly amongst disaffected young men. Fascism is corrosive to who we are and the values of our country—values that Australian men and women have died to defend. I know it's an issue being dealt with at the highest levels of our security apparatus, but we do need to sandbag our institutions, media, regulators, police, courts and infrastructure to ensure they are protected from this insidious, cancerous menace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And, despite the concerns I've outlined above, I am genuinely optimistic. We do live in a wonderful country. It is not perfect, and it has dark elements to its history and its genesis, but that is true of all nations. No country has been forged without blood being shed or injustice being meted out. It is important, vital, that we acknowledge the truth of our history in all its facets, both the dark and the light. I reject the proposition that it is a black-armband-view of history to acknowledge the darkness, but I equally reject the proposition that we cannot or should not be proud of the nation that has been forged and which continues to be tempered; the values that this nation stands for, even if it does not always live up to them; and the bright promise that it holds. There is so much to be proud of, but there is an unceasing duty to keep striving towards the light, towards humanity's better nature and ideals, a duty that falls most heavily, if not exclusively, to those of you who remain within this chamber.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Colleagues, I never came to this place with that baton in my knapsack. The member for Grayndler had nothing to fear from me! I only had a passion to serve, to make a contribution and to be part of a team, and I'm proud of the part I've played. Our government's decision to change the stage 3 tax cuts from being weighted towards high-income earners to become tax cuts for every worker, with tax cuts for low-income workers and bigger tax cuts for average-wage earners is something I'm really proud of helping kick into gear, however marginal my role. That one decision, amongst many others, has made a material difference to the living standards of millions of Australians, and nine out of 10 Tasmanians have more money to spend as a result. I am proud of this government's achievements in so many areas in such a short time: cheaper medicines, fee-free TAFE, higher wages for aged-care and childcare workers, and so much more. We've achieved a lot in three years. Let's see what you lot can do in six or nine.</span>

                  </a>  Or 12—thank you! As a local member, I've been able to achieve things for my electorate, not least the siting of a Medicare urgent care clinic in Bridgewater and a new Services Australia centre in Sorell, both of which officially open today. There are many others: sport facilities, factory funding, communication upgrades, irrigation funding and more, but those two I'm especially proud of. I'd like to thank the Minister for Health and Aged Care and the Minister for Government Services for their support. Over my time as the member for Lyons, around $2 million has been disbursed to local non-profit community groups and talented young athletes, with grants ranging from a few hundred to tens of thousands of dollars, and every single dollar has benefited the communities of my electorate and the people who live in them. I'm sure all members have similar experiences.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaking of achievements, the Prime Minister announced the other week $150 million for the Greater South East Irrigation Scheme in my electorate. I've been advocating for months for this project, but it was Rebecca White who sealed the deal. Rebecca grew up on a farm in the south-east, and she was able to make the strongest argument. She's not even in the parliament yet and she's already delivered a $150 million project for Lyons, not as an election commitment but as funding that will be delivered this term.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've got people to acknowledge: my Tasmanian federal parliamentary Labor colleagues, Julie Collins, Carol Brown, Anne Urquhart, Catryna Bilyk and Helen Polley, for being such great Tasmanian teammates. Of course, I acknowledge Ross Hart and Justine Keay, who were elected with me in 2016 for Bass and Braddon, but who sadly left the parliament in 2019. The class of 2016 is a great class.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the Prime Minister for his leadership and his vision. I thank former leader, Bill Shorten, for his service and his support; the Leader of the House for his intellect and his enthusiasm; the members for Fremantle, Perth and Chifley, whom I knew long before I came to this place from other lives; and so many of you for the chats, catch-ups, advice and support. It's all treasured. Thank you to the member for Macarthur for trying to keep me alive a bit longer.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Across the aisle there are the members for Riverina, Gippsland, Bonner and Bass, whom I have very much enjoyed catching up with. The members for Indi and Mayo have always been delightful company, and the members for Goldstein, Flinders and Parkes, have been thoughtful and positive contributors on my comms committee, alongside our own members for Macquarie and Corangamite. There is so much more that unites the people in this place than divides us. It's important to have the fights, as the member for Maribyrnong said in his speech the other day. It's important to have the fights—to test what works and what doesn't, to stand up for your beliefs and ideals and to poke holes in the other side to expose the fault lines. But I know most of us would prefer that we were able to do it while being just a little bit nicer to each other.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I must thank the many volunteers and supporters who have door-knocked, made calls and allowed me to litter their yards with posters. There are too many to count, both volunteers and posters. What do you do with old corflutes apart from line your chook pen? I don't know, but I'll find out. And, of course, my staff: Lara von Stieglitz, Ben Dudman, Anthony Corke, Lyndell Jones, Mel Franklin and Tom Price, and Shannan Aherne, who just last week gave birth to Harrison, a new addition to her beautiful young family. I'm pleased to say that I won the office sweep on the most likely date of arrival. Thank you all for your service and dedication to our community. My name is on the door and the letterhead, but I have never forgotten that this is a group effort.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank my former staff too for their invaluable contributions, especially the late Sharon Carnes, and Darren Clark, Janet Lambert, Margaret Watson and Lachie Grey, and Natalie Maple, who left me earlier this year after nearly eight years service—she really lost the lottery there—to look after her health. We love you, Nats, and we miss you and wish you all the best. Staff are the unsung heroes whom none of us can do without. Assisting our constituents with their concerns and grievances and helping them navigate bureaucracies and achieve just outcomes are our bread and butter.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recall not long after I was elected that Margaret dealt with a man who had been struggling for years to access his superannuation. He was a bit aggro in his manner, and it was clear that the people he'd previously talked to just wanted him out; he was too difficult to deal with. But Margaret stuck with him, patiently teasing from him the details she needed to chase up his super. He would grump and harrumph, but she would brook no nonsense. She got the details she needed and she got his super for him—$400,000! This guy was couch surfing. It only happened because that remarkable woman stuck by that difficult man and because I'd been in a position to give Margaret a job. Margaret changed his life. There have been so many other cases where my staff have won results for our constituents through dogged determination. I won't take credit for their work; they deserve the acknowledgement. I wish them all well in the next stage of their journeys.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the Australian Labor Party for preselecting me three times and the people of Lyons for electing me for three terms. It has been the privilege of my life to serve in the national parliament. I know I leave my communities across Lyons in the best of hands with Rebecca White as our new federal Labor candidate.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I must say before I leave that I thank the attendants here, the comm car drivers and everybody who assists us in this role. The cleaners of this place are just wonderful. Dom at Aussies—everybody you come across just makes your life easier and better, and I thank everybody for their service.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last, but not least—never least—is my family: my wife, Tania, and our two remarkable children, who have allowed me the freedom to do this job, which comes with such heavy demands on time and on bandwidth. My family is everything to me, but as the wonderful Kim Beazley remarked in his valedictory many years ago, the fact is that, with this job, 'our families come second'. I will miss this job and I will miss you all, but my time here is done. In the immortal worlds of Gotye, now I'm just 'somebody that you used to know'.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:39</span>):  on indulgence—We have just heard a remarkable valedictory from a great Australian who has given us an insight into his character and the generosity of his spirit, with the way that he spoke about his staff assisting people and refused to take credit, apart from saying his name was on the letterhead and on the door. But what we know is that one has to be a great parliamentarian in order to attract great staff and loyal staff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I opened Brian's electorate office after he was elected in 2016, and throughout the last almost nine years, whether it was going to a community centre in Deloraine, a footy game in Longford, a pie shop on the road between Launceston and Hobart—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-GeneralInterjecting">An honourable member:</span>  Ross.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="R36" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr ALBANESE:</span>
                  </a>  In Ross. We want to get that on the record. I very much recommend the scallop pies down in Tasmania. Whether it was those things, whether it was a distillery that was even better than the pie shop, or whether it was New Norfolk, Sorell, Perth or Swansea, I went to all those places with the member for Lyons, because it's an electorate that basically starts when you land at Lonnie airport—that's in Lyons—and you go all the way to Hobart and you're still in Lyons. It includes every bit in between—the valleys and the coastline of what is a remarkable seat with a very diverse community, with agriculture as well as a services sector. Manufacturing is there as well. The tourism area, of course, provides some beautiful spots along the way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Brian worked really hard to win his seat in 2016 and to hold it in 2019 and 2022. We have an insight today, with this speech, into how much he cares about that community that he was able to represent. During the first of those three election campaigns, he took a seat off the then government, which is, of course, hard to do, as is holding onto it, as he did. We know Tasmanian seats have a bit of a history of swapping around a bit. He can take particular pride in the urgent-care clinic at Bridgewater, the Services Australia centre at Sorell, the Sorell Jobs Hub, the new base for the Royal Flying Doctor Service in Launceston and the New Norfolk community sports upgrade—something he's fought for for a long time—but also, more importantly, the integrity that he's brought to the job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Brian and I had a discussion about whether he would contest Lyons again, he was certain that he could win, but he was absolutely certain that Rebecca White was someone who he wanted to see in the House of Representatives, and it's a remarkable thing. I can't think of a precedent for someone saying something like, 'I think I'm a good member, but I think that Rebecca White will make a great cabinet minister in the future.' I have no doubt that she will. As Brian said, Rebecca White is a once-in-a-generation politician.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, I thank you, Brian, for your contribution. On behalf of the Australian people, I thank you for your contribution as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You are a generous, principled, hardworking Australian who wants the best for this country, and you entered into parliament as you leave it: someone who came here to make a positive difference. I have no doubt that, in your future endeavours, you will continue to make a positive difference in the community in which you will continue to reside, but also in whatever endeavours you choose to go into in your future life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also take the opportunity to thank your family for their sacrifice, and to thank your staff for their loyalty, to you personally but also to the electorate. And I wish you all the very best for your future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="230886" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ANDREWS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McPherson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:45</span>):  For more than 14 years I've had the honour of representing the electorate of McPherson in the federal parliament, and today I rise to give my final speech in this place. During my time as the member for McPherson, I've experienced firsthand the many challenges and the great rewards of serving the Australian people. I've had the privilege of representing those who live and work on the southern Gold Coast and of making a contribution to our nation as a minister of the Crown in areas that I'm very passionate about: industry, science, technology, skills and national security.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I leave parliament, I do so with a deep sense of pride in what has been accomplished and with enormous gratitude for the opportunity to serve. The work that we do in this place matters—it matters a lot—and the impact that we have on the lives of Australians is something that I have always taken seriously and will never ever forget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I first ran for office in 2010, I did so with a great sense of commitment to my community, where I've lived and worked for many years, and to the values that have always guided me: hard work, integrity and a strong belief that government could and should improve the lives of ordinary Australians. During the five parliamentary terms that I've served in this place, I've seen the impact of good policy and the importance of listening, understanding and serving those who have put their trust in me to represent them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the people of McPherson, I say thank you—thank you for entrusting me with the responsibility of representing you and being your voice in parliament. Together we have achieved so much. Around $2 billion of federal funding flowed into McPherson during my time as the member, including to upgrade transport infrastructure, especially the widening of the M1 south from Mudgeeraba; to help local manufacturers purchase new equipment; to assist Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary to enhance their tourism offering, such as through the new Australiana-themed precinct, and to the wildlife hospital to treat injured wildlife; to support our veterans and RSLs; to improve road safety by fixing black spots; to improve mobile coverage; to support our aspiring young athletes; to provide beach safety equipment to save lives; to provide much-needed funds to our sporting clubs and community organisations; and to help victims of family and domestic violence—and that is just to name a few. But none of this would have been possible without the backing of my community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, whilst these achievements have all helped my local community, my greatest satisfaction has come from helping individuals, many who have tried multiple ways to solve the problems for themselves but have come up against roadblocks. One of those was Tammy Hamawi, who was fighting to save her daughter Bianca's life after Bianca was diagnosed with a rare and life-threatening blood disease, aHUS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ten years ago, the drug that could help Bianca was considered to be one of the most expensive in the world, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars for an annual supply. Tammy had done everything possible to self-fund the drug Bianca needed to live, but time was running out. Financial support came from Bianca's former school and generous donations, but an ongoing funding supply was needed, and we needed an interim solution while we continued to fight to have the drug listed on the PBS. I made a call to a local hospital which gave us the breakthrough Bianca needed, and I'll be forever grateful to the hospital for agreeing to provide the life-saving drug that Bianca needed until we were able to secure its listing on the PBS. Many people played a part in helping Bianca and others with aHUS, and I thank them. To me, power and influence is something to be used wisely and for the betterment of our communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my first speech I spoke about the importance of local transport infrastructure. Without a doubt, the most significant transport infrastructure I've been able to deliver federal funding for is the widening of the M1, firstly from Mudgeeraba to Varsity Lakes and then from Varsity Lakes south, where construction is currently underway and, hopefully, will be completed in the not-too-distant future. When the widening is complete, it will serve the dual purpose of enabling residents and visitors to get home faster and safer and enhancing the freight corridor between Queensland and New South Wales. I remain committed to the extension of heavy rail south from Varsity Lakes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst representing the people of McPherson has always been my priority, there is much valuable and essential work that is done by the parliament, often in a non-partisan way. I'm very proud to be on the Speaker's panel—so thank you, Mr Speaker. Over my time in this place, I've been on several committees and participated in multiple friendship groups. Today I'll speak briefly about a couple of those.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At various times through my parliamentary career, I have been a member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, including as chair. As one of the oldest investigative committees of the parliament, it's responsible for inquiring into, and reporting back to the parliament on, public works across a wide range of portfolios to ensure, amongst other things, that the proposed projects are cost effective. Public Works is not a tick-and-flick committee, and we have demonstrated this on many occasions, including when the committee insisted on a rescoping of work that resulted in a cost saving of tens of billions of dollars to the Australian taxpayer. This, in my view, demonstrates the importance and value of our committees in delivering a good and better outcome on behalf of Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've co-chaired Parliamentary Friends of Science along with the Deputy Prime Minister since it was first established in 2012. It's a friendship group that I'm very committed to because of my love of science. The Deputy Prime Minister and I have always tried to find ways to inspire the inner scientist in all of our colleagues. With enormous assistance from the Australian Academy of Science and Science and Technology Australia, Parliamentary Friends of Science was launched with a masterclass in astronomy by Australia's Nobel laureate Professor Brian Schmidt. Optical telescopes were set up on the roof of Parliament House and, at the allotted time, an eager group of parliamentarians and guests burst out of the lift onto the roof. They looked up and they saw cloud—not a star to be seen. But we were not perturbed. We were not deterred, even. The official speeches went ahead. Professor Schmidt was invited to speak. We looked up, the clouds parted and there was Alpha Centauri. I don't know who was the most relieved on that night, but I'm very sure that Professor Schmidt was very happy to be able to speak about Alpha Centauri that evening. It was certainly a fabulous night and, from there, Parliamentary Friends of Science has certainly gone from strength to strength.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my view, when parliamentarians are engaged in meaningful dialogue with scientific leaders, we get better policy outcomes. Parliamentary Friends of Science plays a very key role in this. As a mechanical engineer, STEM—science, technology, engineering and maths—has long been a part of my life. As a parliamentarian, I've actively advocated for more students to study maths and science at school for multiple reasons, including that many of the jobs of the future will require strong STEM skills. Empowering girls to see a future for themselves in a STEM career was a key part of my work to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to benefit from the jobs of the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was first appointed to the ministry in 2014 and served as an assistant minister in industry and science then skills before being appointed to cabinet in 2018 as the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was appointed to cabinet, I became the first female federal cabinet minister from Queensland. I also became Australia's 26th cabinet industry minister and the first female to hold that position as well as the 30th cabinet minister for science and the only female science minister to hold a STEM qualification. I was the seventh cabinet minister to hold the technology portfolio and the second woman. Whilst those figures are historically important, what was important to me was the opportunity to bring together industry with science and technology and build a strong industrial base in Australia that would boost our economy and provide the jobs of the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Highlights of my time as Minister for Industry, Science and Technology include the release of a road map to inform government's approach to artificial intelligence and the development of guidelines alongside industry to ensure that AI is developed and applied ethically in Australia, and delivering the $1.5 billion Modern Manufacturing Strategy, which was a whole-of-government strategy designed to support Australian manufacturers to scale up and become more competitive and more resilient. The strategy put manufacturing at the centre of Australia's post-COVID recovery. Six key priorities were identified where Australia had a comparative or competitive advantage, and these were targeted for support. They were resources, technology and critical minerals processing, food and beverage, medical products, recycling and clean energy, defence and space.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Expanding the space sector to boost our economy and create high-value jobs was another highlight, including creating of the Australian Space Discovery Centre and Mission Control in Adelaide; the growth of the Australian Space Agency; strengthening of our engagement with NASA through the Moon to Mars initiative; establishing the National Science and Technology Council to bring science and technology together to provide independent advice to government on key science issues for the betterment of our nation; and appointing the first Women in STEM Ambassador and establishing the Boosting Female Founders Initiative to support women entrepreneurs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">COVID-19 was a global seismic event that challenged the status quo and disrupted lives right across the world. Here in Australia, we weren't immune to its devastating impact. As the industry minister, I worked closely with our manufacturers to assist where possible with supply chain issues and help them make the products that we so desperately needed. Many of our manufacturers pivoted their operations to produce invasive ventilators, PPE, hand sanitisers, vaccines and surgical masks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst there were many amazing stories about our manufacturers, the one that I'd like to speak about today is Med-Con and surgical masks. As COVID took hold, Australia needed surgical face masks, but our supply chains were cut, and we had only one mask manufacturer in Australia, a company called Med-Con, based in Shepparton, that was producing two million masks per year. Clearly, that was not enough to meet our pandemic demands. Many people told me we couldn't lift our capacity to produce more masks and that we just had to keep trying to source more from overseas. They were wrong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the start of the pandemic, Med-Con had three production lines. The first line was operating for eight hours, five days per week. The second line wasn't in use, and the third line just wasn't operational. I spoke with Med-Con several times, and, whilst they were prepared to do everything possible, it would take them time to scale up, and that was time that we didn't have. We sent an engineer to Med-Con to look at the equipment and advise us on timeframes and capability to boost production. It wasn't good news. We needed people and technical expertise, and we needed it urgently. I remember the early-morning call with our engineer when he returned from Shepparton, and it was clear that the only way we could do what we needed to do was to call on the Army.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a Saturday morning. I called the defence minister and asked her for assistance. That afternoon, the Army rolled into Shepparton and into Med-Con's manufacturing facility, and, when they left a few weeks later, all production lines were running around the clock, new staff had been recruited and were trained and operating the machines, the Army had scanned all of the equipment parts, and new machines were being manufactured in Echuca, where the original machines had been produced many years before. By year end, Med-Con's manufacturing output had lifted from two million masks to more than 59 million masks. Other businesses pivoted to mask manufacturing and, by year end, the advice I received was that Australia had produced around 400 million masks. Australia went from two million to 400 million masks production in a year. What an amazing effort from our manufacturers. There are many similar stories about the extraordinary work done by Australian manufacturers during COVID, so I know that we have the capability to continue to grow our manufacturing and industry sector here in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But too many of the manufacturing success stories from COVID have a sad ending. When supply chains reopened and the market was again flooded with imported goods that were readily available at a cheaper price, contracts were cancelled, buyers bought elsewhere and Australian manufacturers slowed production, with some stopping altogether. Australia, we can do better than this. If we want to have an Australian manufacturing industry, we have to buy Australian-made products. Every day I wear something that is made in Australia. I read the labels in supermarkets looking for Australian made and I buy Australian products whenever I can. I urge everyone, whenever they can, to support Australian industry, manufacturers, growers and producers, because, one by one, we can make a difference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Protecting Australians and safeguarding our way of life have always been the highest priorities for me, and it was an honour to be sworn in as the Minister for Home Affairs in April of 2021. It was a tremendous honour to lead the men and women of the Home Affairs portfolio, and I know from firsthand experience that Australia has the best operational law enforcement and security agencies in the world. During my time as Minister for Home Affairs, strong law enforcement action, enabled by record funding and new powers saw record seizures and arrests by the Australian Federal Police and Australian Border Force. Child protection arrangements were significantly improved. A new national strategy to prevent child sexual abuse was launched. The Australian-first technology detection dog program that trained canines to sniff out electronic devices hiding child abuse material was expanded, and the Stop the Stigma initiative to encourage victims-survivors to speak out was launched.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were several significant cybersecurity improvements directly benefiting all Australians, including by supporting industries to grow online by launching the National Plan to Combat Cybercrime, cracking down on the cyber criminals by funding a dedicated AFP-led cybercrime centre, securing landmark reforms to national security legislation to better protect our critical infrastructure, making all Australians safer through passage of important legislation to revolutionise the way Australian agencies investigate and prosecute cybercrime, ensuring our law-enforcement agencies have much-needed powers to combat crime on the dark web, cracking down and protecting Australians from ransomware through the Ransomware Action Plan, facilitating the exchange of digital information with US authorities by signing the CLOUD Act agreement with United States, and launching a public information campaign to increase Australia's cybersecurity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Operation Sovereign Borders was strengthened. I finalised the regional resettlement arrangement with PNG, signed an important agreement with Nauru to establish an enduring regional processing capability to protect our region from maritime people smuggling and reached an agreement with New Zealand to resettle refugees. Counter-terrorism arrangements were strengthened, and I listed the entirety of Hamas and the entirety of Hezbollah as terrorist organisations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would have loved another three years in Home Affairs, but the outcome of the 2022 election meant that was not possible. While my time here is coming to an end, my commitment to this nation, its people and its future remains absolutely steadfast. I look forward to what comes next, because I know that the values that I fought for will continue to guide me in whatever lies ahead. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I conclude this chapter of my career with immense gratitude, pride and hope for the future. Serving the people of McPherson, working alongside some incredibly talented individuals and contributing to the shaping of Australian policy have been some of the greatest privileges of my life. But I could not have achieved this on my own. I was fortunate to have the support of so many people during my time as the member for McPherson.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To those who put their trust in me and selected me to stand for the seat of McPherson in the federal parliament: I thank you. To those who spent hours, days, months and years supporting me during five election campaigns, who worked on polling booths, doorknocked, did letterbox drops or helped at listening post and roadsides: I thank you. To those who have supported me in my electorate office and in my ministerial roles: I thank you. To the public servants at the departments and agencies I had responsibilities for: I thank you. To the Australian Federal Police close personal protection team that looked after me and kept me and my family safe: I thank you. I had the privilege of working with the best of the best. To our lifesavers, clubs and supporters, community groups and volunteers: I thank you. To those I had the great fortune to meet over the last 15 years: I appreciate and value the time you spent sharing your stories with me. I thank you. To the wonderful people of the southern Gold Coast: as your longest-serving member for McPherson, I thank you for giving me that honour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My final thanks go to my family, who have been beside me throughout this journey. Without them, I could not have done this job. My parents, Bill and Moya, taught me the importance of hard work and persistence—that success is not handed to you but earned through effort, discipline and persistence. They taught me how important it is to do what's right even when it's difficult or unpopular. I thank you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My sister, Ann, who was the first in our family to go to university and our very first STEM graduate, has been a consistent and steady source of support and encouragement throughout my life, and I've always looked up to her. I thank you, Ann.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My husband, Chris—his commitment to my political career has been exceptional. I did ask him if there was anything he wanted me to say in my speech. He originally said no. When I persisted—I said, 'Are there any memories or any highlights?'—his response was, 'I didn't think it'd be this long.' He was there, rock solid, for the best days, the worst days and everything in between. Thank you, Chris.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My final words in my first speech were to my daughters, and today my final words are to you, Emma, Jane and Kate. The life of political children is not easy, and I'm enormously proud of the way that you've navigated growing up under a spotlight. In my first speech, I encouraged you to grasp every opportunity that came your way with both hands. You've done that and more. I encouraged you to believe in yourselves, because I believed in you. But it was your belief in me that inspired me to never give up and always do my best. You've grown into capable, kind, generous women, and you stand up for what you believe in. I could not be more proud of you. So, Emma, Jane and Kate, I think the world of you. You are my world. I thank the House.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DUTTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dickson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:09</span>):  on indulgence—Karen, to you today: that was an exceptional speech and exactly what we would expect of you. You have had an incredibly accomplished career. You have dedication to the people of McPherson as much as you do to your own family. The beautiful words that you finished on, to your beautiful daughters, I think sum up what's in your heart and the approach that you've taken to people in your parliamentary career. We had quite a good discussion in shadow cabinet last week where we were able to talk through some of Karen's accomplishments, achievements and career highlights. She has gone through some of that today, but I do want to particularly acknowledge that her being Queensland's first female federal cabinet minister and first female home affairs minister is something that the LNP and the Liberal Party are incredibly proud of. We recognise that milestone and congratulate you for the dedication and determination that it's taken over a lifetime of career highlights to achieve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, might I say, as a former home affairs minister and someone who maintains an active interest in that portfolio to this very day, the way that you led that department is a great credit to you. It's tough in this place to lead an operational portfolio. There are issues day and night here in Australia and around the world you need to contend with to make decisions to keep Australian safe, and you did that with great aplomb. I want to thank you very much for the lives that you saved and the Australians that you protected and the work you did with the Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation and everything in between. It's a great credit to you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish you every success in the next phase of your career, and I look forward to keeping in touch with you. Thank you so much what you have done for our party, for the people of McPherson, for our great state of Queensland and for Australia. Thank you so much.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282306" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PEARCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:11</span>):  It's an absolute honour to rise on the call. I said in my first speech that this place was a daunting place. It's still a daunting place and rightly so. The customs and traditions that surround this chamber remind us of the history and the very reason that we sit here in this parliament. The fact that you, Speaker, sit from an elevated position and control both sides of the argument and both sides of the debate mean that you are the fulcrum of the scales of justice when it comes to that great Australian principle of a fair go. That's what I'm about—a fair go. The fact that we all sit on an even level means that we are selected by the majority of our constituents to come from the four corners of this nation to represent them without fear or favour in this place, this fair-go place. It's important. The mace is your instrument of appointment, Speaker, with its crown pointing towards the government. Long live the Crown only once we are in government!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian national flag, to me, symbolises the four corners of the nation. That flag means everything to me. I will explain as I go through summing up what was important for my service not only here but in serving the nation in the Defence Force. That flag means everything to me and I look at it for daily inspiration and it gives me strength.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to acknowledge my colleagues today and all the help, support and friendship you have given me over the six years that I have been here. That isn't limited to only this side of the chamber. There are some decent people all over the chamber, and I want to acknowledge and recognise that. Mind you, I've seen some deadset shockers come through here! I want to recognise our leader, and I'll say more about that later.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have my family here, and that was a surprise visit. My family are up from the great state of Tasmania. Megan, thank you for bringing the kids up. Megan, you have been an incredible strength to me over the last two terms, the last six years. I'm the bloke that's been sneaking into your house late at night when the kids are asleep, sleeping on the couch and then leaving before they wake up!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge all spouses, or partners, because they are part of our team—the work they do, the rubbish they have to put up with time to time, the support they give us. Sometimes they live a lonely life because we live a life in pursuit of this place and our country. So, Megan, you're a deadset champion. I thank you for that. I couldn't have done it without you, Megan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Next to Megan is my son, Hamish, with the Matthew McConaughey haircut. Hamish, I'm so proud of the young man that you've become. You were just eight years old when we lost Mum, my beautiful Amanda-Jane. I stood with you at her funeral; I held you, and I've stood with you ever since. I'm proud of the young man that you've become. You know what it's like to be knocked down, but, in the great Australian spirit, Mate, you know what it's like to get back up again. Sometimes you need mates to do that, and that's important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember at Mum's funeral I gave you a little dove to release, mainly because you're a farm kid and you needed something to do to keep you out of mischief. As that dove flew away, I made a promise, under my breath, to the universe. I promised myself that I would never let earning money, paying the farm off and my job come between me and my family. Here I am, many years later, doing exactly that, so I'm sure everyone in this place will understand. Hamish, thank you. I'm proud of you, and I love you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is little Isla. When you were born, you represented a new chapter in our lives. You're a beautiful kid. You've got a beautiful soul, and I want to acknowledge that you've had to do a lot of things and a lot of achievements at school without Dad being there. Hopefully we'll fix that from now on. I love you, Isla, and you've got a great future in front of you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is little Elsie. Elsie's had a big trip. Elsie's a little determined and grumpy. She's very focused. It's marvellous what genetics do, and I'm glad she's thrown to her mother.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my family, I want to say thank you for all that you've done not only for me but for the electorate. You'd had to endure long hours.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to recognise my staff. I haven't had a big turnover of staff; I've had the same staff, more or less, the whole way through. Whilst it would be remiss of me to break communications security and release their call signs on an unsecure network, they know who they are, and I know who they are. More importantly, the electorate knows who they are.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we speak of staff, I want you to look at your own staff, as we go into Christmas. I want you to recognise the fact that they're on the end of those phone calls, dealing with those hurt people. We all know that hurt people can hurt. If we don't think that has some impact on our staff, then we need to think again. So I recognise all staff, and I mean that sincerely. We couldn't do it without you. You live a very necessary role in doing our job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said before, the customs and traditions around this place remind me of my job and my role and what is important. As I look to that flag, I look to the fly quadrant of the flag, to the Southern Cross. The Southern Cross is important. It's been our navigation tool for many tens of thousands of years. The small star in the Southern Cross is called Epsilon. It is the smallest star, but it's somewhat brighter than the others. It's actually two stars combined. It reminds me of my state of Tasmania, the smallest state. In fact Tasmania is less than two per cent of Australia's landmass. But we receive more than 13 per cent of Australia's rainfall. It's captured in 54 hydro dams, and we have 30 power stations churning away. They've been like that for more than 100 years, generating clean, efficient, reliable baseload energy. In fact, at the moment, we are exporting from the great state of Tasmania via Basslink 278 megawatts of energy. That's going into Victoria. I hope they don't waste it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The greatest determinant of any civilisation is the production of reliable and cheap energy. It attracts industry and it moves a nation forward. Our nation is at a critical juncture when it comes to the production of cheap, reliable, environmentally friendly energy in this country. Tasmania is somewhat different. Our energy needs are different to those of the rest of the country. Out of the 10,400 gigawatt hours of energy that we consume each year, about 86½ per cent comes from our hydro power stations. The remainder comes from wind and solar. We've also got a line as a backup because we're practical people down there in the great state of Tasmania. It's a line into the mainland of Australia which can import energy if we require it. We've also got a 47-petajoule gas line that comes from the mainland to Tasmania into Bell Bay. That powers our backup generator because we know that we need options. We know that we need reliability but that we also need survivability so that, when one technology doesn't work or is running low on water, we've got others to fall back on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That diversity, that technology-agnostic approach, is what I believe strongly in. We can't simply go down the ideological road of excluding one technology over another, and that technology mix will be different all over the country. We need to be smart about it, and, as the member for McPherson rightly pointed out, we need to apply some science to that. We shouldn't be frightened of new technology. We shouldn't be frightened of nuclear energy. After all, the beams of sunlight that come through that skylight up there come from a thermonuclear ball of gas in the middle of our galaxy. Have a look at how much radiation surrounds the earth, then have a look at the CSIRO report on radiation levels across the globe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The CSIRO are indeed a fantastic organisation, and the CSIRO deemed that, in my electorate of Braddon, at a place called Cape Grim, is the cleanest air on the planet. We also have the purest water, but, as I'll explain in a minute, we are also a powerhouse when it comes to the production of industry, agriculture, forestry, defence manufacturing—all these things. We are the engine room of Tasmania's economy. Yet here we are, at the same time, simultaneously, contemporaneously, having the cleanest air and the cleanest water. What does that tell me? It tells me that we can achieve that balance. Just like you, Speaker, achieve that balance of fairness across the chamber, we can achieve that with an energy mix. Balance is important. Nature believes in balance, and so do I.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The electorate of Braddon is like no other. One of the reasons that I put my hand up to serve the electorate of Braddon was that I was basically fed up with previous members from all different parties right across the board talking down our region. 'We've got the highest rates of welfare. We've got comorbidity rates through the roof. This is bad. That's bad. Give us some more federal money.' As I look at my kids up there, I point out to them how bright their future can be if only they take hold of it and take that first step. It's no different with the electorate. Those young people were leaving in droves. They were moving away from our great electorate, away from our great state, to the mainland and sometimes never returning. So I started, with my great team of staff and my family, talking that region up and working hard every day to ensure that they had the enablers that they needed to make their lives and their futures better. And we did that. In my first term, Braddon received the highest amount of federal investment in its history. That didn't just go to wasted pork-barrelling; that went to roads and freight installations. It went to coolrooms. We built a university. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now I'm a bloke that left school before he turned 15. I did an apprenticeship, and then at 18 I joined the Army. They put me back through school. But I didn't just go back and finish my education. I went back and found education, and I found how transformative that was and how many doors that unlocked. I know how important education is. The University of Tasmania Cradle Coast campus was funded and built, and now it specialises in training health professionals and allied health professionals in Burnie on the north-west coast of Tasmania. It's fully subscribed. We're training RNs. We're training psychologists. We're training physiotherapists. We're training GPs through the royal college, and they work in a ward environment. I'm extremely proud of what we've been able to achieve there. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also unlocked our great agricultural industry and our advanced manufacturing sector. On the north-west coast of Tasmania, we also have defence manufacturing down there, with Elphinstone producing the hulls for Land 400, Land 8116 and our mobile 155-millimetre Howitzer. Every day those people in my electorate are working hard. Every day those people in my electorate are taking risks, spending money and investing in themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Robert Gordon Menzies mentioned the forgotten people. Later on Howard called them the battlers. Morrison called them the quiet Australians. I call these people that are working hard every day the real people, and I've always called them the real people. They're the ones that I take the most notice of. They're often the ones that say the least. They rarely whinge. They rarely write a letter to the editor. They rarely stage a lobby on the lawns of Parliament House or glue themselves to some bridge somewhere. But these real people are the ones that are driving this country forward. These real people are the ones that simply roll their eyes. These real people are the ones that are getting up at three or four o'clock in the morning and producing 11 per cent of Australia's fresh milk on the north-west coast. These real people are already awake, so they don't need to be woken up by anybody from here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned at the start that we are elected here by the majority of our constituents. It frustrates me sometimes that we come to this place and we waste copious amounts of energy and time—and money for that matter because money is time—on a noisy minority. All the while, these real people are screaming for help. So my message today is: we need to start taking notice of the real people in this world, the real Australians, and applying some real solutions for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the huge honour of spending two decades of my life in the Defence Force, in the Royal Australian Corps of Signals. I had the honour of serving with literally thousands of this country's best young men and women. That has indelibly shaped the way I am as a person, and I make no apologies for that. I've worked with some damn fine leaders also. So those veterans, those of us that have served, are important to me, and I'm very proud to be able to say to you today that the north-west coast now has its own wellness centre.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Andrew Clarke and I served in the Army together. He was a bomb technician, an explosives expert—or he worked with explosives anyway! On exiting Defence, they said to him, 'Major Clarke, what would you like to do?' He said, 'I want to continue to help fellow human beings,' so now he's a GP. He's one of our greatest GPs. He heads up the Veteran and Family Centre in Burnie. He does a fantastic job. There we reconnect veterans to a new family, because that is absolutely important and critical when it comes to them making the transformation from the military family to their new employment. We find them a job, but you don't do that with kid gloves either. Andrew has a no-nonsense policy where veterans are required to take the first step themselves. The pity parties have ended. We say to our veterans: 'Get off the couch. Someone is always there to help you, someone will always be there to help you, but you need to take that first step.' It's working fantastically.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've always said, and I want to raise this point very strongly, that I believe the key to our veterans making a transformation from the military to their new life is through their families, because those kids are affected by that trauma that sometimes we go through in the military. Those kids need to understand why mum or dad feels the way that they do. Those kids might actually help veterans through. Andrew is working on a plan, a plan where that family moves through that treatment process and then, at the end of it, when dad or mum gets off the rails a little bit, there's nothing like a gentle reminder from a child—out of the mouths of babes—to bring you back on track pretty quickly. I learned that in that story I told you of Hamish earlier.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've had the absolute honour and privilege of also serving with many fine leaders. In my first speech here, my maiden speech, I told the story about Major General Cosgrove. We were on the border between Indonesia and East Timor in 1999 in an orders group, during INTERFET, and he got fed up with some of the staff officers. He banged the table and he said: 'I am sick to death of some of you people telling me why I can't do things. You need to start telling me how I can.' Isn't there something in that for all of us here? Those real people that I talked about, that's what they're looking for so desperately. They're not looking for excuses or laws or anything else; they just want the problem fixed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was asked by a journalist, following the last election, whether I was Right or Left. To me, that's not how my mind works. I told the story of a lady that I know who works at Simplot, at a vegetable factory. She stands there all night sorting carrots. It was the middle of winter and she'd pulled an extra shift because they couldn't get enough people for the next shift. She did two eight-hour shifts on her feet sorting carrots. She thought about how it's going into winter and those kids needed a new winter uniform. The little girl needed a new tunic, the little boy needed a new jumper. They both needed new shoes. She got in the car after those two back-to-back shifts and drove home in the rain. The car needed new tyres. That's right, the insurance and the registration is due. That was confirmed to her when she got home to make those kids their lunches before they went to school. The magnet on the fridge wasn't strong enough to hold the bills. They all fell off and she said to me that as she's picking them up: 'I just bawled. I bawled my eyes out. Everything I touch has gone through the roof. Everything I touch makes me give up. The only thing that drives me forward is my family.'</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She was a real person. She had real problems. She had real issues. She had real kids. And she couldn't care less whether I, as her representative, was Right or Left. She just wanted her stuff fixed. Isn't that right? The real people of this world, I sometimes agree with Robert Menzies, they are forgotten. On this side, we know that they ought to be put front and centre once again because we really do need to start listening to them.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned leaders. When I mention leadership, I describe it in three words, and they all start with the letter F—are you nervous, Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas? The three Fs that I use to describe leadership are 'firm', 'fair' and 'friendly', and you need to be all of those things in equal measure. If you are—it doesn't matter what severity you are, as long as they are equal—you'll get on in life when it comes to military leadership. It's not exclusive to military leadership. Leadership is important. I've seen many different leaders approach leadership in many different ways. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the blokes that I want to mention and acknowledge here today is the bloke that's touched my life not only in the military but also in this place, Major General Jim Molan, or Senator Molan. I miss him every day. Jim used to talk about defending the country and he used to say that it takes more than a defence force to defend a country; it takes a country to defend a country. And ain't that coming true now! Look at the rising issue of the geopolitical situation across the Indo-Pacific, cyber grey-zone operations and state-based actors. I know from my work on the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade that we often focus on the shiny things in life—things like AUKUS, the LAND 400 and the Precision Strike Missile—but, again, I go back to the real people, because at the edge and behind and around each part of those shiny things there is a person, a highly trained individual. </span>

                  </a>  Jim was right. Jim was also a philosopher when it came to his love not only of the country but of combining that love with the defence of this nation and the national security strategy that we so desperately need. I spoke of Jim's funeral and I spoke of the flag that covered his coffin that day. Again, that flag is enmeshed and interwoven into everything that I think about. For blokes like Jim Molan, every day of their life is spent in the preservation and the strength of that flag. I think that's why I have such a solemn focus on the power and the strength of that flag. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jim was a leader in every true sense of the word. When it comes to leaders, Peter Dutton, I see that strength in you. You have the moral compass, you have the moral strength, and you have the moral support on those benches behind you. I know you will stick up for that little girl who's too frightened to go to school just because she's Jewish, or that little Indigenous kid in Alice Springs who's too frightened to go home because dad has been on the drink and she doesn't want to be bashed or raped. It's not very nice, is it? But it's real, and it's going to take real leadership and it's going to take a real plan to fix that—and no welcome to country in this place is going to fix that. Peter, I have a lot of faith in you, and so do the people on the benches behind you. </span>

                  </a>  Finally, I guess I should close with some words about our flag and how important that is to me. It's best summed up by a story that I read about following the Great War, when some schoolkids visited a museum and they found an old flag—a ratty and torn flag. They asked the guide from the museum what that old flag was about. He was a veteran and he had his medals on. He said to the kids, 'That isn't exactly a flag; that is called a guidon. A guidon is the battle honours that our Australian Light Horse had'—Andrew Hastie. In the military we have colours, banners, standards and guidons, and they are absolutely sacred. They are the things that the soldiers dress themselves off when they go into battle, that dictate the line of advance and the rate of advance. To lose one's colour or guidon is a fate worse than death. It's a disgrace. And these particular guidons, on 31 October 1917, were in the centre between the 4th and the 12th regiments of the Australian Light Horse, as they charged on those Turkish trenches in a place called Beersheba. They took those trenches and they took those wells and they saved literally hundreds of thousands of soldiers. And the old bloke that was in the museum looked at the kids and he said that it was simply a moth-eaten rag on a worm-eaten pole: 'Now, that does not do much to stir a man's soul. 'Tis the deeds that were done neath the moth-eaten rag, when the pole was a staff and the rag was a flag.'</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Look after our flag and all the customs and all the history that it contains, because it will chart a way forward. Protect those real people that I talked about, because they've got real issues. And we shouldn't be frightened to talk about them here.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to say that I am the most humble, the most grateful and the most loyal servant of the greatest electorate of the greatest state of the greatest country in the world. And may it always be the land of the fair go. I want to thank everybody for giving me that opportunity. Thank you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dickson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:42</span>):  I want to pay tribute to the amazing Gavin Pearce. That was a fairly humble presentation, but there were a number of themes that ran through it, and what I know of Gav is that he was a soldier for 20 years, and he went into some detail but didn't do enough credit to his distinguished career. He's been a successful farmer and small-business person—and I mean very successful. And he has had a distinguished career in this place for the last six years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He spoke of the love of his family, of the loss and the accomplishments. Sometimes, when you think about someone in this place, you can go to particular stories—and we will, as we look back, in the years ahead—about our friends and the contribution that they've made to this place, and there are different words that spring to mind: the word association with somebody. And there is no doubt in my mind that, into the future, and whenever we think about Gavin Pearce, I will always, I believe, have the first word in my mind to be either 'patriot' or 'digger' or 'soldier'.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He's proud of his service here in six years, but not every day has been a joy for Gavin, because he has worn his heart on his sleeve; he's worked hard for constituents; he's sacrificed an enormous amount, in terms of his own family and the time spent with them. But what is most in his soul, and what is most, I think, within his DNA, is his time served in the Australian Defence Force. He is somebody who has a great love for this country—for our flag, obviously—but he embodies the best of our country, and we should look to him for inspiration into the future, as I'm sure his children do today and will, for many generations in his family to come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, Gavin, for what you've done for our party and for our country and for your great state, I say thank you, but, importantly—and I know that, as I say, this is what embodies you most—thank you for your 20 years of distinguished service, the young lives that you've influenced, the correction that you've given, the harsh words that you've spoken on occasion, and the way in which you have provided leadership to those young diggers. You're a patriot, you're a true gentleman and you're a great friend to all of us. Thank you so much.</span>

I have had my annus horribilis and I was not able to perform at my peak. Starting at the top, I'll give you a quick run through: vaccine side-effects followed by a serious bike accident—fractured ribs, sternum, vertebra, amnesia for a day or two, pneumonia then pleurisy, kidney damage—and then the ignominy of injuring myself playing cricket. I now have the experience of driving a four-wheel buggy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a bittersweet moment for me to be leaving now as I have really enjoyed my time as an MP in this House, and I will enjoy it to the day this parliament rises. But serving here in parliament as a politician in a big country electorate comes at a cost to other really important parts of one's life, particularly as this is my second career. I had a full-on 33- year career doing even longer hours as a GP, followed by these five campaigns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a whole lot of thank yous to people who helped me get here. Firstly, a massive thank you to my beautiful wife, Charlotte, hiding in the back there, my greatest friend and confidante through this, which is our latest journey but not our last. In fact, it's been a long journey, since 1988. Thirty-four years go in a flash like that. Charlotte has been a constant support throughout all my careers, doing all the hard yards in my junior medical years, coping with me being away on antisocial long hospital shifts by day and night and weekends, then coming home to sit in a room and study and then study again and study a bit more and keep doing exams until I passed. I did not get it the first go and that was the toughest lesson in my life because I used to pass everything first up, but eventually you get there. She then left her international merchant banking career to start our family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We then moved up to Port Macquarie with Isabel—our little three-month-old over there—where we had no family connections to start my gastro enterology practice. Soon enough we had Ollie and Alice as well. Charlotte was doing it all, being a supermum as well as running the practice and the day surgery which we built for our patients as well, and together we also built our family cattle operation. As many of us realise, after I volunteered, our family—my family—were conscripted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the beginning of my political career the kids, especially Alice, explained they were being 'weirded out' by seeing their dad on billboards, on buses and on TV ads like I was stalking them. Thankfully, they are no longer permanently scarred, and all three of my adult children are now confident young adults with careers of their own. I'm so proud of you all. And Ollie, if you are watching or listening over in London, I'm proud of you all and what you have achieved. It's fantastic to see your children flourishing. My deepest apologies for being absent from all your big moments, from family holidays, and from school, university and sports celebrations that I've missed. Thank you, Char, again for your patience, in particular for giving me the time to pursue the latest outrageous idea—that was, to run for federal parliament. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a challenge for families, as we all know. Many of you here in the chamber have had similar experiences, but once you put your head above the parapet and you declare yourself as running for a political party and parliament, you're breaking cover. Sometimes that can mean losing some friendships and groups that see the world totally differently to what you're committing your life to. But Charlotte has supported me through all those, usually with frank, fearless and—it's uncanny, she's always right. She's been my biggest supporter and wisest counsel. I'm really looking forward to our next adventures, which we will do together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also thank my father-in-law, Martin, who is up there, and my late mother-in-law, Elizabeth Maynard, who can't be with us, and all the Maynards for being great in-laws, great grandparents and great cousins. They have supported Char in my many absences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks to all the Gillespie crowd up there—my siblings, Maryanne, Mike, Andy, John, Jane. They're all there. Sadly, Pete, my brother could never be here. Mum and Dad are both gone. They would've loved to have been here. Mum got to see me enter parliament. Thanks to Patrick and all the other in-laws, to Pru and Andy for all your support and to all my brothers and sisters, who've encouraged me and supported me. I can't thank you enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Next goes a big shout-out to my staff members over the years. You've all been great and you've all worked really hard and for long hours, particularly during campaigns, but mainly on solving problems for my constituents. They've been very well served by your efforts. You've helped them with federal, state and council regulations and bureaucracies. Many of my staff have been there all the way through, from the early years. But long before I had any political office, Rob Nardella was there, helping me as a newbie aspiring candidate. He's been there from day one, and he sits here now. He's been instrumental to my time as the member for Lyne. But I'd like to thank all the others, including Georgie McDooling, Noel Atkins, Jane Corcoran and Bill Yates from way back in 2009 and 2010, when this journey started.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks to all the National Party branch members across the original and slightly different distribution of Lyne and the current Lyne. There are over 700 of those people who can proudly call themselves members of the Nationals. I give a shout-out to them all. Together with my staff and hundreds of other supporters, volunteers and booth workers, they have combined to deliver me into this parliament for four terms, and I thank them. There are some who really went above and beyond—an awful lot of them went above and beyond. They know who they are and I know they are, and a special thank you goes out to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To all of my Nationals colleagues here that have sat in this House with me over the four terms, thank you for your support. All my colleagues in the opposition, I thank you for all your friendship, counsel and advice in the good times and the bad times. We've been through a lot.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to thank the late Bruce Cowan, Mark Vale, 'Wacka' Williams, Warren Truss and Andrew Stoner. I also thank Tony Abbott, with whom for years I've plotted politics. He gave me much wise advice and help. Thank you all. I'd also like to thank Barnaby, who called me into the ministry on two occasions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Being a member of the House of Representatives is a great privilege with lots of responsibility. I've worked out that you need a lot of skills to be a good MP. You are not just a legislator. You're a voice for your constituents. You're an inquisitor in committees. You're a policymaker. You're a negotiator. You're part parish priest. You've got to be an economist. You have to be an industrial advocate, a diplomat, a social media genius, a writer—and the list goes on. It has been a journey and a half, full of highs and lows.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a rural member, I have found that there are far more geographic challenges, and all you rural members would know the long distances. There are multiple communities that have their own economic drivers and their own view on what's important, and you've got to know them all, because you can be in one and upset the other. But with tens of thousands of kilometres between parliamentary sittings, it's a big job. But it's been worth it in the seat of Lyne because I've seen all these improvements that we have delivered in government for the people of the electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lyne getting its fair share of our nation's infrastructure build has been fantastic. Before I announced my retirement I asked my wonderful office to collate all the infrastructure that we've delivered in Lyne. It's quite sizeable. I seek leave to table this list.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Leave granted.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Dr GILLESPIE:</span>
                  </a>  The big favourites are the two major Pacific Highway upgrades that bookend the seat of Lyne: north of Port Macquarie to Kempsey delivered in the first term and now the Hunter River crossing. But there is still unfinished business. There are six highway overpass interchanges and several realignments that will need to be completed for it to turn into a full freeway. It's not only for safety. There will be major economic differences if we get those because you get these huge bottlenecks forever. I'll put Senator McKenzie on notice: it's called the Pacific Highway upgrade 2.0. It'll cost about half a billion dollars, but please take note. There have also been two major airport upgrades: within the old Lyne boundaries of Port Macquarie, where jets can now land, and we've got a new terminal, a new taxiway and an apron expansion thanks to the help of Warren Truss, Michael McCormack, Luke Hartsuyker and now Pat Conaghan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the southern end of the electorate, we have the big one: the Newcastle Airport, which is now going to truly be an international airport. We were able to secure two grants totalling $130 million. I'd like to give a big thankyou to our former Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, again to the member for Riverina and to the member for New England for listening and delivering the funds for that. It will be the best-value international airport in the country, not just for the 750,000 people in the Hunter but also for all the people in the Mid North Coast region, who will all of a sudden have their own international airport. All the inbound and outbound tourism that comes via Sydney can also come via us. It won't go to Brisbane; it could come to Newcastle. We've got huge inbound and outbound tourism capability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have noticed that, as a country MP, you see a lot of community and sporting infrastructure and arts funding totally skewed and massive amounts going into capital cities. So I worked really hard to develop sporting facilities in my electorate of Lyne. Sport, in a country town or in a big town, levels all strata of society. If you're in the same sporting team, it's good. It's great for children's development and for teamwork and it unites all layers of society. We've got two major indoor stadium upgrades for basketball: one in Port Macquarie in the old distribution and now a three-court expansion in Taree. New surf club upgrades are scattered across the electorate, including the massive Forster Surf Life Saving Club. Again, I thank the member for New England for the wonderful grant that he organised for that. There were new grandstands, female change facilities and oval upgrades in Maitland, Gloucester and Karuah, and they're just to name a few. We expanded, courtesy of federal money, the Manning Entertainment Centre, and, down the road in Forster, there was a massive project for the Forster Civic Centre precinct, which is an exemplar library and conference centre. It's the envy of other councils.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm really proud of the work we did during COVID, particularly in the health portfolio but also with the member for Bradfield when we got together a fund to keep Australian picture theatres—the genuine ones—alive. Another equally transformative institution from critical coalition policies is the development of the Taree Universities Campus. In 2019 I put together a proposal with education and community leaders, and they took to it like ducks to water. We were able to secure two funding grants to make a new campus a reality. It is the Taree Universities Campus with multiple universities, ensuring access for local young people who couldn't afford to go away, mature-age people or those who are looking to upgrade their skills, whether it's their first chance or their second bite at advancing their education. So Manning Valley, Gloucester, Forster-Tuncurry and the region now have access to a multi-university, community owned facility in a permanent campus for the next 25 years. They have 500 students utilising it now. They've had 55 students graduate—huge numbers of nurses. On checking this morning, I see they have another 65 coming this year. Everyone said this would never work and that it would be a white elephant. I'm so proud of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my community, I was known as a doctor, but it was really cool for me to develop and deliver into my own electorate some really important health facilities. There is now a headspace in Taree, and the Manning Valley now has a public hospital MRI in Manning Base Hospital, when they are as rare as hen's teeth, and there's a new radiotherapy unit being built there. In Port Macquarie, in my first term, when I wasn't in the ministry, with the help of Professor Lesley Forster of the University of New South Wales rural medical school, we developed a unique model that would allow a cohort of Port Macquarie students to train not just for three months or six months as a sampler course but to go from go to whoa in Port Macquarie. She went against the grain, so thank you, Professor Lesley Forster. She is now doing that with Charles Sturt University. It has been an outrageous success.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During this time in parliament, we've had some major challenges. We had the devastating, record-breaking 2019 fires after years of really extreme drought. Everyone thinks it's always green on the coast and that the rivers are always full, but most of them are salty. They're tidal. And we had a drought like no other. Some of the rivers on the coast stopped running. But for the tide, they wouldn't have had water in them. Then a year later we went to the other extreme and had the most massive floods since the 1960s. It was really distressing to see houses, lives, memories and animals literally going up in smoke. Hundreds of buildings, including many houses, were destroyed. Then, in the flood, thousands of people were made homeless. Whole houses and huge numbers of livestock were literally washed away. We had literally thousands of people living temporarily in service clubs, like the local sporting clubs, the RSLs—all sorts of places.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had a few hiccups and a challenge in 2016. We can all get a bad redistribution in the lottery, but I had to speed-date 48,000 new people. They took away Port Macquarie, my home base where I had practised and treated about half the electorate, so that, as a gastroenterologist, I knew them literally inside out. Those I hadn't met at a fete, I had met in the day surgery. But, in spite of what I lost, I gained something even better. I now inherited all the territory down to the Hunter across to Hawks Nest. Just about every tourism and primary industry is now encapsulated in Lyne, plus I picked up the mighty Hunter River and Maitland and all that Hunter history and many service industries and even more people in the mining industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the coast, there were two coalmines. I've got one left, but there are about 20,000 people who work because of the Hunter coal-fired power stations or the coalmines, and they all live in the beautiful part of Lyne. But there are opponents and obstacles everywhere, coming for all these primary industries. They are all at threat with the net zero agenda. Often it's these harmless sounding names like 'restoring our rivers' or 'nature repair' or 'a safeguard mechanism'—like a poison pen in a soft, cuddly name. They are all coming. We have a huge problem because these are all the industries that make us our money. We won't have an energy system, if we don't have base load.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got a huge red-tape reform agenda that we really need to start again. There's a heap of confusion in the federal-state fiscal relationship; it's totally unbalanced now. Originally, state and federal responsibilities were very clear. We had a good constitution. States used to do a whole lot more without getting out of bed to get a grant from the feds; it's a complex history. Their revenue and regulatory arrangements were matched by appropriate fiscal ability, but it all changed in World War II when a lot of the powers were temporarily ceded to the Commonwealth, and then they never wanted it back because of the war debt. But now it's all confused. Half the money comes from here. It's like the proverbial structure of a plate of spaghetti if you try and do all the connections between who runs what and where the money comes from.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In his first term, Prime Minister Tony Abbott instigated a federation reform agenda; I'd been whispering in his ear for a long time. In that context—without his knowledge, because there were other matters—I developed a tax reform paper and a parliamentary budget analysis to launch the push for the expansion and increase of a broad based consumption tax. It argued for major reductions in income tax, company tax and several other taxes and imposts as well as for increasing the welfare safety net. It would provide extra revenue streams that better aligned the work that the states and territories have traditionally done like running hospitals, police and schools, and building main roads, dams, bridges and railways. Of those things that I've just mentioned, it's only the police that we don't give money to the states for, so we're on the hook for everything else.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We did get lift-off with that debate, and several states got behind it. It was really encouraging considering I was a backbencher in my first term. I thought: 'Wow. John Howard tried twice and I'm just on the backbench. We're going to get the GST up.' Unfortunately, it didn't fly. As they say in those blogs and in lots of podcasts, the rest is history. But I think we need to readdress the red tape and green tape that is strangling both federal and state governments. I think both federal and state governments have left too much of the policy work to delegated authority in the public service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a few 'to do' jobs and suggestions for you; you're not bound by this, but I just thought I'd put them in there. The cost blowouts in infrastructure are scary. An extra guideline here, another environmental measure there or another community consultation—the next thing you know, building a new highway roundabout can take eight or nine years instead of 12 or 18 months and it costs three, four or five times more. We really have to stop and think, 'Just keep it simple.' Make it all rule by common sense. It would be really good if we did have a deregulation agenda in the next political cycle and require all departments and agencies to begin putting proposals to remove 25 per cent of the regulations that increase costs. Put in a new test, something like 'one in, one off' or 'one in, three off', similar to Paul Keating's competition payments—he started that—or Tony Abbott's asset recycling payments. There needs to be some incentive to get the states on board. It's not the sole preserve of this side to do these things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my time as a minister in the health portfolio I worked up many long-term projects that I'm really proud of. As the member for Parkes mentioned last week, things in the health system have a long gestation. It takes about 12 years to become a fully fledged doctor hanging a shingle. While I was there I established the position of rural health commissioner, which is a vital role and doing good work. Of the three commissioners, two have been appointed by me. They have all done a great job. We created more holistic long-term benefits for rural centres so that they could attract, train and retain doctors and nurses: end-to-end med schools; HECS fee relief for nurse practitioners and junior doctors working in rural and remote parts of our country; expansion of the Flying Doctor Service, securing its planning for over a decade; and, as I mentioned before, expansion of the rural medical clinical schools placements from sampler placements for three or six months to end to end, beginning to end. Everyone was clamouring for a Murray-Darling medical school, but it was proposed to be at the expense of the 17 established rural clinical schools that are a great legacy of Michael Wooldridge; they had the sampler variety of placements—maybe six months or a year. But I thought, 'Hang on, the perfect solution is what we did in Port Macquarie.' By wheeling and dealing and getting the heads of the universities around the table, I organised for Melbourne uni to set up a whole medical school in Shepparton in the seat of Nicholls. I got La Trobe a deal that meant the top 12 graduates from their biomedical degree would go straight into Melbourne uni. With that method, Monash did a deal with Albury and Bendigo.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That then started more of a chain reaction. I was able to convince UNSW to do what I did in Port Macquarie without any money but just by rejigging it, to establish one in the member for Riverina's electorate, so now he has an end-to-end one. The members for Fisher and Fairfax will know the horse-dealing that went into starting the Sunshine Coast medical school. You were both there for the opening, with Greg Hunt. Also, for Charles Sturt University's applicant process, I did the policy work and the deals to pair them up with Western Sydney uni. So now the Sunshine Coast has its own medical school, Charles Sturt has its own medical school, Wagga has its own medical school, Shepparton—you name it. When I came back the next time, following my call-back to the ministry, the member for New England and I were able to secure more Commonwealth supported places, so the member for Leichhardt could get an expansion up in Cairns and the member for Barker in the Riverland could get an extended training program for doctors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During my time in child services, it was a bit distressing. I was there during the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, where I heard many harrowing stories. I also had oversight of and insights into the state-run foster-care system. The children there are usually there as a result—it's the same thing—of either drug or alcohol addiction, or both; domestic and family violence; appalling child neglect; or, sometimes, mental health. Back in the old days, they were there because there was shame in being unwed and having a child, so kids were adopted out. That doesn't happen now. These children are coming from, in many cases, a bad space.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You want these children to have what every other child wants, and that is a permanent home. Fostering is meant to be a stopgap measure—and they're glorious people that do it. But there's an inertia in the system, not to change. Instead of foster care being temporary housing until children are placed in a permanent parental arrangement, depending on the state—it's only New South Wales that allows adoption easily these days, but they have open adoption—there are now 46,000 children in permanent foster rotations. When I was in the ministry, it was only 42,000. And it seems to be growing, more and more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I did have the temerity to suggest that adoption should be made easier and earlier with an open adoption model, where the biological parent or parents know where the child is, the child knows where the mum and dad are, and there are the adoptive parents. So it's open, but the children get permanence and they're not bounced around the system. I still hope there can be some positive arrangement made with the states.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is sensitivity about the stolen generation. Let's face it: that was a pretty scary and bad period. But permanence is what a child needs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This experience in my own electorate gave me the resolve to get more children and family services into my electorate, because there is certainly a need. We got a big grant—again courtesy of the member for New England—to finish off the most amazing building—a wonderful, friendly, uniquely designed building and community organisation called First Steps Count Child and Community Centre. It has everything in it, all in a one-stop shop, from playgroups to hearing checks to eye checks to assessment for autism spectrum—any childhood problem—and it's going really well. It's fantastic, and it will deliver long-term benefit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is another really exciting thing, but I had to be a bit subtle about this, because I think I might appear on the list somewhere. There was a bit of legislation when I was in the ministry, the Autonomous Sanctions Amendment (Magnitsky-style and Other Thematic Sanctions) Bill 2021, that was looking for someone to introduce it. Someone tapped me on the shoulder, and I thought: 'Hey, I've read <span style="font-style:italic;">Red Notice</span>. I know all about this. There are a lot of mad and bad people doing very evil things and moving money into Australia or around.' So we had that legislation. I'm pleased to see it's established. It gets reported on all the time. But I introduced it and shepherded it through this House after it came here from the Senate. So that was great.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Being a minister has its pros, but, gee, being a backbencher is a great honour, and you can get a lot done. Other people have mentioned the parliamentary committees. They are a critical part of parliament. They're an invaluable informal channel for diplomacy and exchange of ideas and perspectives, and they can get ministers and members and senators up to speed on issues that are really technical and important. A lot of these experts will really give you fearless and frank knowledge rather than fearless and frank opinion or policy, which is totally different. The net outcome is that the parliamentary friendship groups, as well as the formal committees, are a really invaluable part of this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of my medical background, I was on every one, or every second one, of the Parliamentary Friends of medicine. There is a long list, as the member the Macarthur would know. We've done a double date on so many things. I'd like to thank him for all his assistance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also thank the member for Makin. We've been on a tour through batteries, and I can tell you there are not enough minerals in the world or enough mines in the world to deliver the amount of batteries that will last 10 years. The idea that this world is going to run on electric vehicles is one of the biggest naivetes ever. We've looked at electric vehicles in Korea. We've looked at them in Japan. They are an amazing technology but so material rich it's scary. We will have to mine more copper than has been mined since records began just to get enough copper to get this 'transition' up to about 2030. So the markets are responding. Not everyone wants an electric vehicle, so I think nature and people's needs will sort it out. But that's the importance of these committees, because you find this stuff out. This whole transition thing really should be described as an addition. Electric vehicles are just the latest and greatest new form of transport. If you really want to electrify transport, get our Inland Rail up and then electrify it. Get our high-speed rail up and electrify it. Get more mass transit in our big cities, rather than 'mass transit' meaning everyone buys a smaller car and there are three million cars instead of two million cars. So that was it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My best thing ever, and probably my most substantial non-legislative role, is setting up the Parliamentary Friends of Nuclear Industries. I must say it's been great fun. I was a nuclear sort of child in my medical career. You do physics at uni as well as high school, but my first job was injecting radioactive isotopes into people. Can you play the dark scary music over there—isotopes! ABC sign from the left, please! Anyhow, radiotherapy and isotopes have allowed medical practitioners like me to diagnose to treat, to cure and to do amazing scans. I have had more radioisotopes on me than I can poke a stick it, but I'm still here. It's only too much radiation that's dangerous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The idea that any radiation is bad is a totally debunked theory. It's called the linear no threshold theory. It's not a straight line—zero being nothing and the other end being really bad with anywhere along that being less bad. No. To get bad, it has to go up, and then it straightens out. But that's a bit of an aside.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the minister for ARPANSA, the authority on radiation protection and nuclear safety, twice, I got to see what our amazing capability is in this country, and it is sizeable. It's far greater than even I realised. In the news just the other day was the announcement that we're not part of the gen IV group with the UK and the US, but we are actually the chair of it, and we've been the chair since 2017. It's a research and safety standard setting organisation for six different types of advanced reactors. They're the ones that you're hearing a lot about in the SMR space. They don't boil water and act like a kettle and a steam engine that spins an electric generator; they boil salt or lead or helium at really high temperatures. Our guys at ANSTO have been setting standards for molten salt reactors and high-temperature gas reactors, so there we go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That same place, ANSTO, has developed this amazing industrial final waste repository system. It's a big factory. It's world-leading. It's called symo, named after Synroc, which is a technology ANSTO developed. It will take permanent transuranic, all the really bad 'iums' with which you can't do anything more, that are a side product of all the medical isotopes and stuff they do at ANSTO. That will deal with our own waste. It is world-leading. I've had American professors and big Canadian engineering firms saying: 'Can we be your agent? We'll sell 11 of these around the world.' It is world-leading. The idea that we don't know what to do with waste is absolute rubbish. But I digress.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank the member the Hinkler. He started my electrical engineering tutorials back in the first term. He's taught me a lot about grids. I joined the ANS, the American Nuclear Society, and have been to as many conferences as I can. Along the way I've met some amazing people, and I want to give a huge shoutout to my biggest tutor, Rob Parker, who's up there in the gallery. He's doing a great job with all the lectures and information around the country. I will also shoutout Robert Barr, who's been a sidekick on our tours to North America; Tony Irwin, who has built and operated eight nuclear plants, and he went over when Chernobyl happened and taught the Russians how to really run it, and he lives in Australia. To Helen Cook, Stephen Smith, Dave Collins and all my turbocharged pro-nuclear Argonauts out there in big, wide Australia, being marshalled by Peter Sjoquist—a big shoutout to Peter. He has got to get the award for the most WhatsApp group messages ever.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank Tim Stone, in Britain; professors Jacopo Buongiorno and Andrew Whittaker, in the USA; all the engineers at Hatch engineering; AtkinsRealis, which built the CANDU reactors; and Ontario Power Generation, which is the second-biggest power utility in North America, and guess what? It's government owned. It's like our Electricity Commission of New South Wales. The biggest one in America is Tennessee Valley Authority. Hey presto, guess what? It's owned by the Tennessee Valley Authority, another government owned power utility. They've been very helpful too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The friendship group had lift-off. The aim of educating and convincing members and senators on the nature of nuclear energy and its potential here in Australia has been reached. We in the Nationals have been ahead of the curve. We've seen the light, and our membership and federal council adopted this many years ago. I'm so pleased and proud that my liberal colleagues are now onboard. That is the way to go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know there are lots of members on the other side who are secretly pro-nuclear, but they chickened out once they got into government, and they're strictly following orders. But they're welcome back. You can always change your mind when the facts change. That is quite okay. We won't criticise you at all. But it is bipartisan anywhere else in the world, and there are now 31 countries that have signed up to triple their nuclear energy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the other great friendship things we run in this country is the nation parliamentary friendship groups. I reckon that's one of the best gigs going, because you get to meet a lot of really interesting people in the embassy and that come out from whatever country. I've signed up for so many of them I just can't get to them all. But the one that I've really tried to make a difference on is the Australia-Japan parliamentary friendship group, because Japan and Australia are really important to each other.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1862, at the start of the Meiji Restoration, when they decided to industrialise, Japan's first load of coal came from somewhere down in the Illawarra. We've been sending energy ever since. They have built that industrial powerhouse with gas, oil and coal from us. They don't and can't have solar panels, so that's why they need us. In places like Korea, they're exactly the same. We shouldn't feel guilty at all. It is absolutely rubbish that our ecowarrior extremists are trying to make out that Australia is bad for the world. We power with food 100 million people besides ourselves, but we're only 25 million. We supply energy for over a billion people, like those in India, yet we're measured on our carbon footprint as though we're using all the energy and food. It's really not logical.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to acknowledge His Excellency Suzuki and Ken up there. Thank you so much for what Japan has done for us. After the war, thanks your investment in Australia, started by John 'Black Jack' McEwan, we made peace and have moved forward ever since. Your technology is the bread-and-butter technology that we all use in Australia, and your investment has developed our mines, our energy systems and everything. It would be so cool if we could get a high-speed rail gunning up the north coast once we finish the Inland Rail. We will go from strength to strength.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to keep going, but I'm going to run out of time. I just want to say thank you, Peter, for your leadership, particularly for your commonsense approach to policy development, including on nuclear energy. I think you'll make an excellent Prime Minister. It is lucky that, as I found out from Bill Shorten's speech the other day, I am probably the 220th MP to get to make a valedictory, which sounds a lot more exclusive than the 1,244 that came in and made maiden speeches. It has been a pleasure, Mr Speaker, to work with you on the trade and investment growth committee. It was also a pleasure to serve on the speaker's panel in the last parliament. I would have loved to have done more. One recommendation I can give to first-termers: do some time on the speaker's panel, because then you know all the procedure, and you're not walking around like a dazed person in your first term. You know what all the terms mean and what the procedure is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to thank the presiding officers and all the assistant clerks and parliamentary support staff who have assisted me in my duties here in this place. I would just like to leave you a couple of to-do items for when, hopefully, we do get into government. We've got nuclear and electricity covered. It will take time. But the urgent necessity for this nation now is that we've still got an electricity system that works—just. It might tip over the edge. But where we are really thin is on liquid fuel security. We have got to, as President Trump said, 'drill, baby, drill', because we need to get liquid fuel security in this country. Again, the 10 biggest oil and gas businesses aren't BP or Shell; they're state-owned enterprises. So if Australia is really going to develop our oil security, take a leaf out of INPEX, which is publicly owned but the golden shares are owned by the nation of Japan. Maybe that is something we should look at. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to thank all the coalition leadership team for all the work you're doing. It is really important that we all have our ducks in a row for the next election. I'll be helping whoever wins the preselection on the weekend get to be the next member for Lyne. Timing is everything. As Kenny Rogers said, 'You've got to know when to hold them, know when to fold them …'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been incredibly fortunate to serve the communities and people of the Lyne electorate for the past 12 years. I would like to thank them again. They put their trust in me for over a decade or more to travel down here and fight for the issues that they thought were important. I have thoroughly enjoyed being your MP, meeting all of you and everything else in this wonderful building. For those of you who have had my three-times-a-year newsletters, you would have seen this little catch line: 'he listens, he cares, he delivers'. But I can quite happily stand here, cross my heart and hope to die and say I listened, I cared and I did deliver.</span>

His legacy extends well beyond just the infrastructure he has been able to deliver for the people of Lyne; it goes to the heart of his beliefs and his experience in the medical profession. In fact, he missed one. When I first became the member for Maranoa, I fought hard for the Heart of Australia bus. He was the assistant health minister and he delivered funding to that bus. That now has gone from one to six buses that go throughout rural and remote areas, checking out people for heart conditions and it has literally saved lives. It is a great legacy the Doc has left. His indelible legacy will be that of nuclear energy. He has been passionate from the outset and has driven the debate, not only internally within our party but also in the coalition party room.</span>

The great experience and the calmness you have brought to our party rooms, the pair of you, are something we will miss. But we respect the legacy that you have left us. We will be custodians of it and we will ensure that the next parliament respects what you have both achieved. On behalf of the National Party family, we wish you all the best in your retirement.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Leichhardt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:33</span>):  I stand here today in the chamber on probably one of the last occasions I will be speaking in my career. I can't help reflect on a journey that has spanned more than a quarter of a century. For a little bit of nostalgia here, Mr Speaker, you will see something and don't be too shocked. This is the first time this term I am actually wearing a tie. For nostalgia, I thought I would wear something that I wore back in 1996, something that was very bright that reflected my electorate to make sure that, as an early politician, people knew who I was and knew I was in the room. I have a great collection of them. I am hoping I can eventually make a quilt out of them and donate it to charity. I thought today was a very special occasion, so for the first time this term I have worn a tie and it represents the Great Barrier Reef.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has certainly been an extraordinary privilege to represent the people of Leichhardt for close to 26 years. I owe my deepest gratitude to the people of my electorate, whose trust in me has allowed me to serve for so long. From my humble beginnings as a lad porter at the Mareeba railway station at the age of 14, I never imagined where my life's path would take me: cleaning toilets in the railway station, serving in the Royal Australian Air Force, selling real estate, catching crocodiles and rounding up a few feral bulls. For most of my life politics wasn't even on the radar, but life has a funny way of leading you to places where you never, ever expect. It certainly led me here.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my maiden speech, back in 1996, I spoke of the need for better infrastructure, better connectivity, a better future for Far North Queensland. At the time there was virtually no mobile coverage in the region. Many of our roads remained unsealed, and the idea of sealing the Peninsula Development Road was just a distant dream. But today that dream has largely become a reality. Connectivity, mobile coverage, the NBN have transformed our region and we are well on our way to sealing the Peninsula Development Road through to Weipa, and I'm proud of the progress we've made—although of course there's always more to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of my earliest tasks in this place was working on native title reform with Senator Nick Minchin. There were concerns about native title and the impact it was having on both Indigenous and non-Indigenous residents in Cape York—and that's what actually motivated me to first get involved in politics. The grievances were fierce, the debate was heated. It was through this challenging work that I found my calling in this place actually, a drive to seek balance, fairness and solutions that actually benefited everybody, not just one side of the argument.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many moments throughout my career that I look back on with pride, but actually two of the earliest successes still stand out. The first of those happened when I'd only been a member for a matter of a couple of months. It was securing $40,000 for portable cattle yards in Weipa to support the live cattle export through the Cook Shire Council. The second one was even more significant, and again was in 1996. I secured $500,000 in funding for a banana farmer north of the Daintree River who had been devastated by black sigatoka, a fungal disease that had wiped out his entire crop. It was the first time an Australian grower had been able to get compensation for a crop lost through an exotic disease. I remember calling the farmer, Tony Reichelt, on Christmas Day in 1996 to deliver the good news. The gratitude of his voice still stays with me today. It was quite amazing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not long after I was first elected, I was involved in the debate about gun control following that tragic massacre at Port Arthur. Prime Minister John Howard had decided to utilise such a sad and powerful moment in time to bring about a profound cultural shift in the attitude of our nation towards firearms. There was a perception at the time that, given my background, I would fall in behind those advocating for the status quo to remain, but that certainly wasn't the case. I supported John Howard's push for reform. When we look back, we can see that those important changes have made Australia today a perfect example of what sensible gun control looks like, and I'm incredibly proud to have played a role in bringing in such important reforms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a less serious note, I recall in 2000, as our nation prepared for the Sydney Olympics, the Cooktown community was left disappointed when the Sydney Olympic Games Organising Committee, SOCOG, decided the Olympic torch relay wouldn't be coming to Cooktown. They claimed it was 'too difficult' to include us. But anybody who knows the people in Far North Queensland knows we just don't give up that easily. Instead of lamenting the decision, my dear friends Peter and Kathy Stapley, who owned the <span style="font-style:italic;">Cooktown Local News</span>, and I decided to do something about it. Together, we created our own alternative—NOCOG, 'Not the Organising Committee of the Olympic Games'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What began has a tongue-in-cheek response quickly grew into something far more significant. With the help of local ingenuity, we crafted our own Olympic torches, including a beautiful crystal torch manufactured by Mitsubishi from Cape Flattery silica sand and a symbolic aluminium torch forged by Rio Tinto in Weipa. To keep the spirit of remembrance alive, we borrowed the eternal flame from the Cooktown RSL. These torches became the centrepiece of our own relay. Our NOCOG torch relay was truly an epic journey. The torch travelled across every Cape York community by road, foot, horse, dinghy, light aircraft and even helicopter. Along the way we shared stories about the Olympics, giving kids in some of the most remote parts of the country a chance to be part of the excitement. At the same time, we raised money for the Royal Flying Doctor Service, ultimately collecting over $200,000—a remarkable effort that speaks of the generosity and the spirit of our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, NOCOG wasn't just about raising money; it was also about having a bit of fun and showing our resilience. We hosted what we called the 'relaxation games' in Cooktown one week before the actual Olympic Games, with events such as the watching-the-grass-growing competition, fishing without bait, wave counting—provided you had no numeracy skills—and the now famous, or infamous, armchair sleeping competition. I've got to tell you: you're looking at an Olympian. I had the dubious honour of being part of NOCOG's first doping scandal, and I say that with a little bit of embarrassment. After my gold medal performance in the armchair sleeping competition, I was disqualified when it was deemed alcohol was a performance-enhancing drug.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the end, NOCOG was recognised with a national award for creativity and success, including a cash prize and—would you believe it?—one of the original torches, so we did very well out of it. Today, those treasures are proudly displayed in the Cooktown RSL, a symbol of what can be achieved when a community comes together with determination and, of course, a sense of humour.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During my time in the parliament, I've had the opportunity to serve in various roles—first of all as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources and then as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, positions I held for eight years. Working with Joe Hockey, we delivered the first tourism white paper and secured one of the largest investments in tourism, in spite of the challenges we faced at the time—and I backed Joe 100 per cent on this. The Treasurer at the time was not real keen on releasing funds—we were still looking at paying back debt—but we both said that we were going to step down from our roles unless it was supported. To John Howard's credit, he not only gave us what we were asking for but actually gave us significantly more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As you would expect from a member hailing from the Far North, I've been actively involved in all things Northern Australian. I've been involved in the production of the White Paper on Developing Northern Australia. I've also been the longstanding chair and now more recently deputy chair of the Joint Select Committee on Northern Australia. It's been a labour of love, and it has been instrumental in unlocking and supporting our region and dealing with the unique challenges that we face.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my maiden speech, I also raised the issue of mental health. At the time, mental health services were in a crisis, and week after week I stood in the party room reminding colleagues of the dire need for more investment in this area. The deinstitutionalisation of mental-health care left our streets and prisons as the new institutions for those struggling with mental illness. I read out stories from the media each week, highlighting the tragic outcomes of a system that just was not working. After relentless advocacy, Prime Minister John Howard announced a $1.9 billion investment in mental health over five years, crediting me with playing a very significant role in securing the commitment. It was certainly one of my proudest moments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My work in mental health didn't stop there. I have long been the independent chair of our local headspace consortium, and I give a big shout-out to Gabrielle Gill and her team for the job well done. I think the work that organisation does is absolutely critical. I am also incredibly proud of being involved with the establishment of the Junction Clubhouse in Cairns. This facility provides a safe space for those transitioning out of intense mental health treatment, encouraging them to reconnect with their community and rebuild their lives. It's a fantastic model, and it's had some amazing success. The Junction Clubhouse celebrated its 10th anniversary recently, and I'd like to thank Suzie Pont and her team for their dedication, as well as all the members that make the Junction what it is today. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of my more recent roles has been serving as the Special Envoy for the Great Barrier Reef. The five reports I handed down as part of that role challenged even my own government at the time—the government's views on climate change. I made a conscious decision to work only with the scientific agencies responsible for managing the reef, including the GBRMPA, AIMS, the CSIRO and others. The work in this space has certainly helped to move us closer to climate targets and played a role in securing our net zero by 2050 commitment. This work wouldn't have been possible without my dedicated adviser and researcher, Sam Batt. I say thank you to Sam, who was instrumental in educating me, as well as in guiding our efforts. Sam's hard work and expertise ensured that we remained focused on the science and delivered meaningful outcomes for the reef. The reef, like so much of our environment, is a legacy that we must protect for future generations. I leave this place knowing that we have made significant strides. But, of course, like everything else, there is always more work to be done. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another significant achievement was the establishment of a northern Australian cyclone reinsurance pool, which I'm proud to have brought to fruition. It's backed by a $10 billion government guarantee. The pool offers a solution aimed at reducing insurance costs for homeowners, small businesses and strata properties in high-risk regions. For too long the cost of insuring properties in northern Australia has been unsustainable, forcing many to go without proper coverage. While the cyclone reinsurance pool is a major step forward, it will require ongoing reviews, refinements and support to ensure it continues to deliver for those it's designed to help. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of causes that have defined my time in the parliament. One of those has been my advocacy for medical cannabis. Some of you may recall in 2014, on a Channel 7 Sunday night program, there was a story featuring Lucy Haslam and her late son, Dan, and the challenge they faced in accessing medical cannabis to support him in his terminal cancer treatment. They were really, truly, national pioneers in this area. After watching that program, I reached out to Lucy and became very firmly committed to that cause. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another was my journey was advocating for the LGBTQI community. This journey began in the late 1990s when a young naval officer from HMS Cairns approached me with concerns about discrimination he faced because of his sexual orientation. He'd been promoted and was ready to be transferred. They were taking him, all of his furniture, his dog, his budgerigar, his car and his boat, but they wouldn't take his partner because they were a same-sex couple. I was outraged; I couldn't believe it was true. I went and saw the then minister, Robert Hill, and he fixed it. I thought everything was fixed and done, but, of course, there was still a lot to do. I then found out—and I vividly remember—the story of John Challis and his partner, Arthur Cheeseman. John was a retired public servant with a defined benefit pension—some of you may or may not know what they are—and Arthur was a retired pharmacist who'd worked during a time before superannuation was widely adopted. The couple had been together in a loving, totally monogamous and committed relationship for over 50 years, but, because they were a same-sex couple, Arthur was not entitled to John's superannuation benefits should anything have happened to him. Together, they had a modest apartment in Sydney, and, again, if something had happened to either one of them, other family members could've disputed their estate. This held profound implications for both gentlemen and could've resulted in their homes being taken away from them, with a significant reduction in their retirement income should either of them pass away. This injustice, and many like it, continued to drive me to push for the removal of the legal and financial discrimination against same-sex couples. Even in my absence from this place, I was proud to see that the legislation I had been working on for so many years for the removal of discrimination went through the federal parliament unopposed in 2008, supported by both the then prime minister Kevin Rudd and opposition leader Brendan Nelson.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I just alluded to, and as many of you would know, I voluntarily retired from this place in 2007. I made this decision so that I could fulfil a commitment I made to my son when he was quite young: that when he became a teenager he could come and live with his dad—it was dad's time—so that I could spend quality time with him in his teenage years. I never expected him to remember it, but, unfortunately, he did. When he turned 13, and I got a phone call from his mother saying, 'Are you ready to take your son?' I had to say yes. He's sitting in the gallery here—right there, the fellow with no hair and the beard!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a very, very difficult decision at the time because I had a lot of work that I hadn't finished. But I believed that it was the right thing to do: to walk away and leave this place behind me, with the work that was left. But I've got to tell you, it was the best decision I ever made, in all the time I was in politics. Thank you, Jacob, for not forgetting that promise that I'd made to you. I certainly cherished the time that we had together. I'm still proud that I could fulfil that promise to Jake. It was Jake who actually convinced me to recontest Leichhardt in 2010, as he was getting ready to head off to university. And, of course, I successfully did that at the 2010 election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Arriving back in Canberra in 2010, I was proud of the fact that I was not only the first Liberal member for Leichhardt; I had now been elected twice over. I was informed by the then speaker of the House, Harry Jenkins, that I had, in fact, set another record, insofar as I was the first member of the federal parliament since Federation to have voluntarily retired from politics then recontested the same seat for the same party and won. I can now proudly add a third record to that list. I am now rapidly approaching 26 years served in the parliament and I am now, by a margin of over a decade, the longest-serving member for Leichhardt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once I'd got my feet firmly back under the desk, I was determined to pick up where I'd left off and to continue my advocacy efforts for removing discrimination against the gay community. However, this was in 2010, and both Prime Minister Julia Gillard and opposition leader Tony Abbott had both individually committed to not dealing with the matter of marriage equality for the entire term of 2010 to 2013. While I was prepared to respect the leaders' position, I made it very, very clear to Tony that I would honour his commitment in the current term, but I asked him not to make the same commitment in the next parliamentary term, and, to Tony's credit, he gave me that commitment and he definitely kept it. I say, thank you very much for that, Tony Abbott.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I served as the chief opposition whip from 2010 to 2013—a whipette, down there with Nola, who was one of my whips as well. That period of time provided me with an opportunity for my first significant piece of collaboration. I worked closely with Graham Perrett, sitting over here, and Sarah Hanson-Young, and together we established the first ever parliamentary friendship group for the LGBTIQ community of any parliament in the world. I'm proud to say that, in 2024, I remain the only remaining founding parliamentary co-chair of that group, which is still very active to this day. I'm sure they will continue their important advocacy efforts, even after I finish in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At 10.13 am on 4 December 2017, I had the privilege of introducing the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 into this place. At 6 pm on Thursday 7 December, the bill passed through the chamber, and the rest is recent history. I say to those who stood beside me, both inside and outside this chamber: thank you. Together, we made history. Initially, I did not agree with the postal plebiscite process at the time, but I thank our leader for that, because I'd tried to do it once before, unsuccessfully, and Peter came to me and said, 'What about this as a way?' and I said, 'We'll try it.' It was his idea; he went with it and got it up. While, as I said, I didn't agree with it at the time—I thought we could just go to a conscience vote—I'm certainly glad that we did it now. I do believe it was the right decision—thank you, Peter—because there have been absolutely no challenges to the legislation. What we've seen is very strong acceptance throughout the Australian community. Today in Australia, I'm proud to say, we do not have gay marriage; we simply have marriage. In Australia, I'm proud to say, we don't discriminate, and I think our society is a better place for that fact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a brief footnote to the chapter, the gentlemen John Challis and Arthur Cheeseman, whom I referred to earlier, were able to marry. I'm very happy and proud that we were able to enable them to do that. They did that five years before Arthur's passing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On another one of my campaigns—I think this next story might illustrate to members that if you focus and persist, you can move all sorts of mountains. After the passing of my very dear friend and colleague Don Randall in July 2015, I felt that it would be an appropriate and fitting tribute for members who passed away while serving in office that they be commemorated within the parliamentary precinct. Given Don's love of roses, I put forward a proposal for a portion of the rose garden at the entrance of the House of Representatives—it was known as the Zonta garden—to be dedicated for those members who died in office. At the time I thought it was a very fitting and worthy idea; however, I soon learnt that even the gardens within the parliamentary precinct are in fact heritage listed and were not for change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Persistence—I was persistent, I was determined and eventually it paid off. I would like to thank the former Speaker Tony Smith, who worked with me and assisted in making it possible. It only took about 18 months, but we now have a beautiful rose garden at the House of Reps entrance, dedicated to members who passed away in office. I was fortunate enough also to have even convinced them to agree to plant some of Don's favourite roses: the Dolly Partons and the Double Delights. I won't say why they were Don's favourites, but nevertheless they were. I actually visited the garden this Thursday, and they look absolutely magnificent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For those people who frown on plagiarism, on this occasion I'm happy to endorse the Senate's recent decision to install a memorial plaque in the same garden, recognising senators who have also passed away in office. I would encourage members, if you haven't had the opportunity of seeing what's been achieved at this beautiful garden, to go down and have a look, and enjoy the serenity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to say that, when members leave this place, there's often unfinished business and sometimes even regrets, and I do have one regret. After 25 years of working to give my community north of the Daintree River an option for mains-equivalent renewable power, the project is at a crossroads. It's been a long time coming; the money for the project was set aside prior to the 2022 election. There has been an enormous amount of work done in the community, led for many years by Russell and Teresa O'Doherty and strongly supported by Richard Schoenemann and Phil Keogan from Volt Advisory. Over time, the project has been able to achieve all the necessary approvals and the permits for construction, and they now hold all the necessary licences to proceed. This is quite extraordinary given where the area is. They did this in record time. The project is nestled between two World Heritage listed areas: the Daintree Rainforest and the Great Barrier Reef.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally they've secured excellent, credible, experienced investors for the project. But unfortunately our region experienced Cyclone Jasper at Christmas last year. It was absolutely devastating and impacted the commencement of the project. We're only now, nearly 12 months on, getting access to the site. The impending wet season, due to permits from the Wet Tropics Management Authority, means that we couldn't start working on the commencement of the project until at least after the wet season in April next year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the natural disaster, it seemed like the current government was on board. We had environment minister Plibersek proudly declaring on Facebook, 'We have ticked off a solar project that will power the entire Daintree community. The project alone will prevent four million litres of diesel from being burnt.' The project's proponents were deeply engaged with the  Kuku Yalanji traditional owners, and they were brought on as a major partner for the construction of this renewable grid. Even better still, the Kuku Yalanji traditional owners were going to own the grid and be the operator, the wholesaler and the retailer. We were all set up for a unique and inspiring project that would be Australia's first Indigenous majority-owned renewable electricity grid. This was going to facilitate the opportunity for the  Kuku Yalanji people to start bringing home families that had been displaced from the area many years before and, ultimately, help them to build homes on their traditional lands.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But Mr Bowen, his department and his bureaucrats have done everything in their power to prevent this project from going ahead. They bluntly refused to release the money that had been set aside by previous governments. It is an absolute disgrace and, in my view, an act of political bastardry. The irony of this situation is we have had the Prime Minister at Garma Festival declaring that his government is committed to, as a matter of priority, unlocking opportunities for Indigenous communities to be involved and to participate in the development of renewable energy projects right around Australia. But his own energy minister seems to be intent on undermining a fantastic project, ultimately ruining the Indigenous community's vision of self-determination and economic empowerment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has spent millions of dollars on the Voice referendum but, at the same time, has ignored the voices that they claim they wanted to listen to. Quite frankly, it is a disgrace. Indigenous communities don't need slogans and they don't need hand-wringing; they need partnerships and a government that supports their aspirations. I say to Minister Bowen: do the right thing, listen to the voices of the Kuku Yalanji people, the voices of the very senior elders like Aunty Francis and Aunty Kath Walker, get out of their road, stop playing politics, release the funding and let them get on with the job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate I have been proud to secure funding for many projects that have transformed the area, from the Cairns Esplanade boardwalk to the peninsula development along with JCU medical, dental and veterinary schools and the upcoming university hospital to name just a few. These projects continue to have lasting impact on our community. But one of the causes closest to my heart has been securing the recognition for the Torres Strait Infantry Battalion. Their service during the Second World War went unacknowledged for far too long. Thanks to the tireless efforts of people like Uncle Etti Pau, Vanessa See Kee and my 'three generals' Serico Stephen, Carulas Isua, Waraka Adidi. In 2001, we finally were able to secure the recognition these brave soldiers deserved, with the Pacific Star Medal finally granted 54 years after their service. The last two of the 880 Torres Strait Islanders that served in the Torres Strait Light Infantry Battalion, Mebai Warusam, Awati Mau passed away within a week of each other. They enlisted together on Saibai Island and served together. Sadly, their passing brings to a close a unique chapter of our history. The legacy of their service lives on and I am deeply honoured to have played a role in ensuring that their service has been given the recognition this truly deserved. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also ensured that the Australian War Memorial has received the memorial videos which I had commissioned for both Mebai and Awati's funeral. They are part of the Etti Pau collection on the Torres Strait Light Infantry Battalion in the War Memorial.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Reflecting on the Torres Strait, I would be remiss if I didn't note the importance of a major infrastructure program. In 1998, Australian and Queensland governments came together to address infrastructure needs in the Torres Strait and the Northern Peninsula area through what they call the MIP. The initiative focused on delivering essential environmental health infrastructure including fresh water supply sewerage systems, waste management, road sealing and more. Helping to advocate and secure that funding for the MIP has made one of the most impactful differences for this region. I'm very proud of my involvement. Over the years, more than $300 million has been invested, transforming these communities and significantly improving health and living conditions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The relationships that I've built over many years have been some of the most rewarding aspects of this journey, and I'm deeply grateful for the friendships and bonds that have stood the test of time, transitioning the political divide. There are people like my good mate Brendon Nelson. Patty Secker was another one of the whips when I was the chief whip. Donny Randall is no longer with us. Nicky Dondas, then there's Jane Prentice, Jimmy Lloyd and Patty Dodson, my mate from Broome. There's Teresa Gambaro, Bob Baldwin, Joel Fitzgibbon and Steven Georganas, who was sitting in a seat here earlier on. There's Maria Vamvakinou, Kay Hull, Russell Broadbent and Warren Snowdon. That's just to name a couple! They've been mates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And, of course, there's you, Mr Speaker. For anybody who's going to go on delegations, if the Speaker is leading those delegations, go with him. He is brilliant, and he has become a very, very good friend. I'm not sucking up to you too much. Nevertheless, I am stating a matter of fact. Thank you very much indeed for your friendship.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All these have been dear friends whose friendship I have maintained over many years. There are others here, including Scotty Buchholz, who is sitting over there, nodding his head at the moment. It's been great. Thank you all for being part of the journey with me. The camaraderie that we've shared has made this experience all the richer. I respect all those friendships, and I will carry them with me long after I've left this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks to both the Liberal and the National parties and, more recently, the LNP. All those amazing members and volunteers and supporters over nine election cycles have provided amazing support to me. Each and every one of you can take credit for the success of those campaigns. I won't start listing names; there are just simply too many. I'll just say thank you to all of you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks to my staff. I have a couple sitting up here in the gallery at the moment. There have been many over the years. Thank you for all of your contributions. You've kept the wheels turning. I couldn't have done it without your hard work and dedication. The overwhelming success that we've had across the electorate is because of the work that you guys do and, while I've been the recipient of much of that credit—I keep saying this—you are the ones that actually make the magic happen. I couldn't have done it without your hard work and your dedication.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks to my current team. Natasha Sambo has been with me over 14 years. Rosie Korman, who's sitting up there in the gallery, has been with me for over 10 years. Sam Batt has been in the electorate office for eight years. Tanya, who is up here, has been with me for over seven years. Then, of course, there's Zac Webster, Karina Hussey and Tay Laifoo, who's the newest starter. Thank you for everything you've done for me and for the electorate. Of course, I cannot leave without mentioning Tamara Srhoj here. Although she has moved from my office, she has been amazing, and I have to say thank you very much. She was a very important part of my team for many, many years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks to my family, particularly my wonderful sons, Jason, who's not here, and Jacob, who surprised me today. He blew me away when he walked into my office. Thanks to my beautiful daughter Mackenzie Lee. Your love and support have been the foundation that has kept me going through tough times. Serving in the parliament comes with many sacrifices—which we all know—none more so than the time spent away from our loved ones. I couldn't have done any of this without your encouragement and your support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I prepare to step away from this place, there's just one thing I'd like to say to a lot of the newer members here. You will note that I was actually on the executive for eight years. I was the chief whip for three years. But for a long period of time I chose not to be involved in the executive because I had things that I wanted to do. Unlike the other side, we can reserve our right. I couldn't have done the work that I did with gay reform et cetera had I been a member of the executive. I was able to do that by staying as a humble backbencher. Those changes have changed the country, and I'm very, very proud of that. Remember that when you are tacking out your political career.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I prepare to walk away from this place, I do so with a heart full of pride and with a deep love for my community. My hope is that the work we've done together—the big things and small things—will have a lasting impact on Far North Queensland. Leichhardt will always be my home, and, while I'm no longer your representative in the chamber, I'll always be there to advocate for the region. I look forward to what the future holds in Far North Queensland, and I know that the next generation of leaders will continue the work we started.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've often said that my career has been a storied one, full of challenges, triumphs and a few laughs along the way. I've had the privilege of being a part of some of the greatest national policy shifts in Australia's history, whether it be the gun law reform, introduction of the GST, the establishment of the Future Fund or paying off our national debt in 2007. When the government changed, we didn't owe a cracker to the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Although we've changed dramatically since then, with the GFC, COVID and a couple of Labor governments in between, the point is I was and still am very proud to be part of a government that really flexed its economic prowess and has put us in a great position to respond to the challenges that came from the GFC and, of course, from the pandemic. It enabled us to adequately support the economy and, particularly in my patch, we were able to deploy targeted support to a range of tourism entities that needed the financial life support. Whether it was JobSeeker or JobKeeper, zoo and aquarium support packages, large tourism operator support packages, the TTNQ-specific package or chartering airfreight for live coral trout and crayfish export, the extensive array of support kept our region alive. Some of those packages were actually born out of my office. I want to give thanks to the then minister Simon Birmingham, who came up and worked with me, and, of course, Prime Minister Scott Morrison. That work allowed us to recover from the COVID crisis and has helped us to emerge from the global crisis as one of the strongest economies in the developed world at this time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've secured millions of dollars of funding commitments and support for my region. I've advocated for equality and strong environmental policy. Often, I've often found myself in politically challenging circumstances, but I wouldn't change a thing. I say unequivocally it's been one hell of a journey. I reckon it's not too bad for a 14-year-old toilet cleaner from the Mareeba Railway Station.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, I remind people that this is merely a retirement from politics and from political life. I'll still be around. There are plenty of things that I've got left to do. I will be maintaining my fierce advocacy for the eradication of tuberculosis, so I'll be continuing my longstanding relationship with the Global TB Caucus.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will also continue my work with another passion of mine, the National Threatened Species Institute, working closely with my dear friends Peter and Val Gowland up there and their son Daniel, breeding threatened native species, particularly small mammals and birds, for release back into the wild. I'm proud to say that we've been incredibly successful in these endeavours. We have a number of successful releases of captive-bred new holland mice and smoky mice back into the wild. We're now one of the largest breeders of orange bellied parrots in the country, and we have the only eastern ground parrots in captivity in the world. After 2½ years, they're absolutely thriving, and we're looking forward to the pitter-patter of small feet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to give special thanks to the House of Reps staff, the attendants, the cleaners, the Comcar drivers and all those that help make our great democracy function. Thank you to you all for your assistance over many, many years. It's been a pleasure getting to know you all and working together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll conclude by thanking the people of Leichhardt again for their overwhelming and unwavering support and the faith that they've placed in me. There is a part of me that will miss this place and the work that we've done here, but I'm certainly looking forward to the next chapter of my life. I wish you all the very best. Take care of each other, and never forget the privilege it is to serve in this place.</span>

                  <a href="00AKI" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DUTTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dickson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:14</span>):  on indulgence—I want to say to the member for Leichhardt that that was a fairly sanitised version of his contribution to the party room, I might say. My recollection is somewhat different. Entschy was a case study in tenacity and the ability to stay on message and to demonstrate passion about what was important to him—he named a few of those topics, starting with mental health—and he did not give up. He didn't give up in relation to same-sex marriage. He didn't give up in relation to insurance for Far North Queensland. He didn't give up in relation to many other issues where he saw injustice and where he had a desire to try and make a difference to the people of Far North Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't speak on behalf of all my predecessors, but on behalf, I'm sure, of John Howard and also Brendan Nelson, Warren Entsch was a tour de force in the Howard years. He had a particularly forceful way in the party room, as I say, and John Howard felt that. It was as a result of his advocacy that he did make a very significant contribution. Similarly, Entschie, I might say your loyalty to Brendan Nelson was a hallmark of your character. You stood by him particularly at a time when he wasn't treated very well in this place. I know that he will never, ever forget that, and I'm sure he would want me to mention that today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just finally, Warren Entsch came into this place with a CV that has never and will never be matched in the history or future of this country. When he came to this chamber and into this parliament having been a crocodile wrestler, a bull rider, a cattle producer—which he was too modest to mention before—and many other things in between, you knew it was going to be a pretty interesting ride. Entschie, for all of those who've worked very closely with you and have respected you during work on same-sex marriage and migration matters as well, where you wore your heart on your sleeve and really put in effort for people who otherwise wouldn't have enjoyed time this country that they deserved, and for the people of Leichhardt and Far North Queensland, you really have been an exemplar. You've been a great ambassador of our party, and I'm sure we will continue to work with you in the next phase of your life. You have been a wonderful member of parliament, and we wish you health and every success in the future.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:18</span>):  While he's still here, I just pass on my best wishes to the member for Leichhardt in his future endeavours. I'm sure there will be some great opportunities in front of you Warren, so all the best. It's been fun working with you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spoken before in support of the government's reforms to the difficult area of aged care. During our nine long years in opposition, I was a frequent speaker on the former coalition government's failure to act on the issues in aged care that were outlined in the royal commission's interim report, which was bluntly titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect</span>. The royal commission's reports detail substandard care ranging from food and medication management to skincare. Respondents spoke of the mismanagement of health conditions such as dementia, and they also spoke about abuse, including physical and sexual abuse and quite arbitrary restrictive practices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is just a small snapshot of why the royal commission's report had 148 recommendations. It was clear to everyone that the aged-care sector needed a dramatic overhaul to improve the quality of participant care. That report told us that, as a country, we had really let our older Australians down. As a nation, to do so is unforgivable, especially considering what that generation did for Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the years since the <span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect</span> report was tabled, 136 recommendations have been addressed. I just want to remind everyone that 94 of these recommendations have been implemented by the Albanese government. One of the first acts of the 47th parliament in 2022 was passing aged-care legislation that responded to the royal commission. As a government we understand that we must have an aged-care system that upholds the rights of older Australians receiving aged-care services. Our system must be ambitious and it must be infused with kindness and dignity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thus I'm here today to speak in support of the Aged Care (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024, and I commend the minister for the important work that she is doing. This bill will support the operation of the Aged Care Bill 2024, which will commence from 1 July next year and deliver a rights based aged-care system. This legislation is a once-in-a-generation reform that will shape the way we support people to live independently and with dignity as they age. As the Minister for Aged Care said when she was introducing this bill, the government recognise that everyone will need support to understand what the new changes in this bill will mean for them, what they will need to do and when they will need to do it. That means that the government will support older people, providers and workers to prepare for the changes arising from the new act by providing clarity on what is new, what is changing and what is staying the same. The government is preparing an aged care transition taskforce to help providers manage implementation challenges, including ICT, education and compliance. Eligible providers will also be able to apply for up to $10,000 to assist with the cost of any IT changes needed to prepare for 1 July next year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will place high-quality, safe and compassionate care and services for older people at the centre of the system. The bill includes provisions that will ensure that individuals can move as seamlessly as possible from the 1997 act, the Commonwealth Home Support Program and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Flexible Aged Care Program to the new act. This bill also includes provisions which will deem approved providers to be registered providers under the new act. It will smooth the transition process for providers and ensure that they can continue to provide services to older people uninterrupted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also includes technical provisions to clarify how provider obligations, governance arrangements, regulatory powers, information management and decision reviews will transition to the new act. It also implements a crucial lawmaking power to allow transition to be managed in a carefully considered way. The scale of this reform means we need to be able to act quickly during transition to address challenges and unforeseen impacts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill repeals the Aged Care Act 1997, the Aged Care Quality And Safety Commission Act 2018 and the Aged Care (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997. From its commencement, it will make the Aged Care Act 2024 the Commonwealth's primary aged-care legislation and pave the way for the future of aged care—and probably put a few lawyers out of work! These reforms build on the work that the government has already done to improve the quality of aged care and to increase the wages of our aged-care workers. We know from the royal commission that workers in this industry were systematically underpaid and undervalued. The low wages and poor employment conditions meant that it was hard for the sector to attract and keep well-skilled people. It also led to unacceptable staffing levels, which in turn led to cases of substandard care. We all know from our elderly friends and family how important it is to have continuity of care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the Albanese government's approaches to aged care has been to recognise the value of aged-care workers, which will hopefully help with retention, and we have done so not just by kind words but by investing $15 billion in pay rises to these workers. This aged-care bill also prioritises the training of well-skilled workers to deliver high-quality care, including specialised dementia care, a tsunami that is difficult to face. It also introduces new worker-screening measures, which is an important step towards professionalising the workforce through positive registration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've met many dedicated and professional aged-care workers when visiting aged care homes in my electorate and also last year when they were caring for my father. It's important to remember that the workers in this industry care for our aged parents and relatives. They provide the professional support that families cannot. They are there when we cannot be. They provide a unique level of care, and all of us who have had a parent or relative in aged care are filled with immense gratitude for the care these workers provide.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is also going to deliver a rights based aged-care system, with a new program that will support older people to live independently in their own homes for as long as possible. We know that older Australians want freedom, support and, importantly, the choice to stay in their home and in the community they know and love. I know from my own father's circumstances that he wanted to stay in his home, but unfortunately the medical situation was such that we had to move him, and to this day I still think that that move broke his heart and led to a premature death. Nevertheless, across our country right now there are families having those difficult discussions about when or if their loved ones should be moving to an aged-care facility. The reality is that in some cases moving to an aged-care facility can exacerbate the situation and result in the person's health deteriorating, like in the case of my father, Brian Perrett. That is a dilemma that many families face. Not one person wants to see their family member decline because they need to be in a centre where they can access more care. Not one family wants to experience that for their loved one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our $4.3 billion investment in Support at Home will deliver better and more tailored support for more people, with eight levels of ongoing care instead of the current four. It will also cut wait times to receive those in-home aged-care services, giving more chances to keep people ageing in place. It will also mean that those in need of walkers and wheelchairs should gain faster access to this technology. There will also be an increase to the maximum level of support. That will rise from $61,000 to $78,000. In addition Support at Home will provide palliative care support to make sure that older people can spend their final weeks in their home surrounded by their family, friends and neighbours.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We went to the 2022 election promising to lift the standard in aged care, and I believe that we are delivering on this commitment. We've made aged care more transparent with star ratings for residential care. This has helped older people and their families be empowered to make more informed decisions about the care facility that they're entering or already living in. The statement of rights outlines what older people can and should expect from aged care. This bill will ensure that all older Australians in the aged-care system will continue to receive high-quality care, and I particularly thank all those who help provide that care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Minister for Aged Care said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The passage of the aged-care bill and its consequential provisions has the potential to provide a new and enduring foundation for the Australian aged-care system from 1 July 2025 and for years to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been an incredible body of work done by the minister and others, and I thank them for what they have done and how they will make so many Australians' lives easier. We owe it to older Australians and all who rely on aged care now to get this done. We owe it to the growing number of people who will rely on the system in the future. It is how we judge ourselves as a nation. Let's make sure that it's a system that has at its core freedom, kindness and dignity. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:28</span>):  With the passage of the Albanese government's Aged Care Bill through the Senate, the coalition has upheld our commitment to a rights based framework for older Australians to guarantee a world-class aged-care system into the future. The Aged Care (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024 makes technical transitional and consequential provisions to support the commencement of the Aged Care Bill 2024. This legislation contains three schedules. Schedule 1 amends the Crimes Act, the Freedom of Information Act and the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act to align the aged-care worker screening requirements with the established disability and childcare requirements. Schedule 2 transfers administrative and legal requirements to ensure existing services delivered under the old act are conveyed into the Aged Care Bill. Schedule 3 repeals existing aged-care legislation from 1 July 2025, including the Aged Care Act 1997, the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Act 2018 and the Aged Care (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although these technical changes are required, what is most disappointing about this bill is the fact it lacks clear transitional arrangements to support the sector to implement the government's Aged Care Bill. Throughout the important Senate inquiry into the Aged Care Bill, witnesses consistently gave evidence that the absence of a clear transition or implementation plan will make the implementation timeframes, particularly for the new Support at Home program, unachievable. This could negatively impact the care that can be delivered for older Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An overwhelming number of witnesses emphasised the lack of information in the Aged Care Bill, combined with the uncertainty about the content of subordinate legislation and delegated instruments, making it exceedingly difficult for stakeholders to prepare for the upcoming changes. Mr Tom Symondson, CEO of the peak body for aged care providers Aged &amp; Community Care Providers Association, stated that there are serious concerns across the sector regarding the preparedness for implementation and the need for 'a sensible transition'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, it is not only providers who recognise how crucial it is to understand the transitional arrangements before these changes can be implemented. During a lived experience panel, older Australian Mr Peter W, who lives with heart failure and severe respiratory disease, stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Providers, financiers and those ensuring in-house governance cannot prepare new systems without a profound understanding of all the rules comprising grant subsidies that will not be fully available until February 2025. The earliest that Support at Home can start is 1 July 2026, not 2025. So don't rush. Let's get it right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this government continue to ignore the voices of the older Australians that their Aged Care Bill seeks to support. This government continue to put an election cycle before the needs of older Australians and the broader aged-care sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has become overwhelmingly clear that transitional and implementation arrangements must be in place to mitigate the legitimate risk of unintended consequences from the Aged Care Bill coming into effect on 1 July 2025. The coalition will continue to call on this government to address the need for transitional provisions. That is why the opposition last week in the Senate moved an amendment that sought to include transitional arrangements within the Aged Care Bill. In doing so, we sought to ensure that the government put in place clear implementation provisions and grace periods for up to 12 months from the date this legislation comes into effect. It would have ensured the significant package of reforms could be implemented without perverse impacts for older Australians and the sector. Worryingly, the government did not support these amendments. Labor voted against the inclusion of a transitional provision and, in doing so, they voted against ensuring providers are prepared by training staff, adapting budgets and IT upgrades.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to ensure that unique operations of small, individual and regional providers have a clear transition timeline so that they can adapt while maintaining high standards of care. And while the bill establishes the framework for transitional rules to modify provisions of the new act for a period of 12 months, there is no guarantee that the minister will actually provide for any transitional arrangements. We do not believe that transitional provisions should be optional, particularly when it comes to reform of this size. They should be mandatory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will continue to stand up for the sector, which has made it loud and clear that transitional provisions must be in place. We believe there must be an obligation on the minister to prescribe transitional rules. Because while the government believes there is a one-size-fits-all policy option to implementing its reforms, the coalition knows that's not what it looks like on the ground. Given the diverse landscape of the aged-care sector, it is vital that policy decisions reflect the realities faced by all types of providers, particularly those in regional areas that may experience unique challenges.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the coalition, we will always stand up for older Australians living in the bush to ensure they are not forced to move thousands of kilometres away, leaving their loved ones behind, because of this government's rigid regulations. The government must ensure changes are not stressful for the community and are easily understood by the residents within aged care. That's why we also need flexibility in legislation to ensure it is appropriate for aged care right across Australia, not just those in inner-city suburbs. And that's why, most importantly, transitional provisions must be in place to implement the aged-care bill in a way that recognises the diverse landscape of the aged-care sector across our nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition will support this bill in line with our commitment to the new rights based framework for our aged-care sector, but we condemn the Albanese government for putting at risk older Australians and the aged-care sector by neglecting to provide a clear transition period.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BROADBENT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:35</span>):  Thank you for the opportunity to speak on aged care once again, after many, many times. I support the member for Barker's remarks in full, in total, absolutely. Personally, I don't have a problem with where the Aged Care (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill is headed, and the coalition have already announced that they will be letting this bill go through on the voices. Having said that, I have a major problem with the implementation of the bill and the processes we've come to, to this point.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last thing Prime Minister John Howard said to me before his government was defeated and he was defeated was, 'Russell, don't come and ask me for more money for aged care,' because the exponential increase of moneys put into aged care from the time I was first elected in 1990 until this time has been astronomical. So every government has had to increase the funds it outlaid on aged care. But I would put this to you: the implementation has always been the problem, and it is a problem today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">John and Betty came into my office. He's now in his 90s and is living at home with his wife. All he wants is his lawn mowed, nothing else. He has a package, but the package can't be implemented because the agency that has the package hasn't got the staff to do it. We found out recently with another inquiry we had that the agency that is charged with the responsibility of delivering the package has 88 people on its waiting list to get their lawns mowed or their gutters cleaned or whatever it is; there are 88 people just for lawns. It may not seem like a big thing to get your lawn cut, and, yes, his son comes in sometimes and does it, but there are other times John would like the place looking nice. We as a government have outlaid funds for them to do that, which was the old HACC, the Home and Community Care, program. That program has been transferred into private hands, and the private people are in it for profit; therefore, there are less funds for the end users.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm disappointed that I asked for a meeting with just an advisor to the minister at the start of this session, and nobody has come back to me from the minister's office. My question is this: if the provider is allocated that particular individual as a client of theirs, are they paid an administrative fee for the 88 people on their books who are not receiving the benefit? If someone has been given an aged-care package which has been agreed to by the government, the government thinks it's done the right thing; it has put the packages out there for the people—'Look what we've delivered'—yet the end user is not getting the service that the government believes it has provided.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not my only request of providers. I've actually had them in my office, and they've said: 'Everything's fine. We're getting around to it. We'll get there. We'll do it when we get the staff'. One provider said, 'But we don't really provide into your area,' but they have the responsibility for our area, for Gippsland. They don't have the people in Gippsland to do the jobs that need doing for the people that live there, in my area. But the government believes that they've provided the packages. The government's done the right thing; it's provided the package. But where's the connection with the government response? One of the things I spoke to former prime minister Scott Morrison about was the number of people that have been taken out of the department that used to provide a direct service for troubleshooting in aged care. They're no longer there. A member of parliament like me gets an 1800 number to ring, or they're told to ring the minister's office, or they get a ministerial response, which can take ages. These people need the help now, not in the future sometime when someone gets around to it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you have been given a package and that's been given to a provider to deliver, I want to know whether—I say again—that provider is getting an administrative payment for that package when they are actually not delivering the service. That's my message today. How can we as parliamentarians be responsible for government outlays, which the government has outlaid in good faith, right across this nation, so people can still live in their homes? Direct aged care in the home could save the government millions. Those people could still live at home and operate because we could make every service we have available to them, which would make their lives in old age better than they otherwise would be. But if those providers are receiving a benefit from government without providing the service, that has to stop, and it has to stop today. If, after a reasonable period—say, a month—they've been unable to provide the service, that package has to be withdrawn and given to another provider who will deliver the service. I don't think that's unreasonable. You can't keep someone's package in your hands if you are receiving a benefit—and I'm guessing they are, for the package—and not deliver the service. That's my point today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that every member of this House cares about older Australians, none more so than myself. I started volunteering and fundraising for an aged-care facility, and we called the program 'A cry from the heart'. We raised the money and built an aged-care centre that's connected to our hospital. It's not new for me. It's been ongoing. I won't give up. I will continue. Thank you very much.</span>

Dr Haines will join us shortly when she is available and I will conclude my remarks. We currently have a significant challenge in and around migration. The challenge is one that resonates not only with traditional considerations around migration but also with the economic situation that we are dealing with. Over the course of the last two years, we have seen significant challenges around the number of people arriving as net migration as put upward pressure, if you like, on inflation, which is resonating significantly. With that, I am grateful to my friend, who has indicated she might assist the House as we wait for Dr Haines.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:46</span>):  I thank the honourable member for Barker for allowing me time to get to the chamber; it is very kind of you. I stand to oppose the Migration Amendment (Prohibiting Items in Immigration Detention Facilities) Bill 2024, which gives the minister the power to declare an item a prohibited item, introduces sniffer dogs into detention facilities and creates Australian-made Guantanamo Bay-esque detention camps. From the outset, it is worth pointing out that this is not a new bill; rather, it is a rerun of the Morrison government's proposal to ban immigration detainees from accessing mobile phones, and is indicative of an appalling race to the bottom. This is the fourth time this bill has been produced since 2017, when the then immigration minister Peter Dutton introduced it on behalf of the coalition government. It was then reintroduced in 2019 and again in 2020 yet each time it has failed to pass the House due to a lack of support, including from the then opposition, the Labor Party. While many have feared that Labor has been inching closer to the coalition on immigration policy, the introduction of this legislation shows they are not even trying to hide that fact anymore, moving what is essentially a cut-and-paste of Peter Dutton's previously failed migration strategy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill amends the Migration Act to allow the minister to determine that an item is a prohibited thing in relation to immigration detention facilities or persons in detention. These broad and discretionary powers would allow the minister to determine any item, from a mobile phone to a SIM card to a stuffed toy, as a prohibit item if the minister was satisfied that it would pose a risk to the health, safety or security of a person in a facility or the order a facility. For example, there may come a day when the minister decides reading glasses should be prohibited, as this item could potentially be used to make some sort of weapon, even without proof there was ever an intention of the owner to do so. They might decide to confiscate shoelaces or they might decide to confiscate medicines. Scarily, all of these things were routinely confiscated back in 2014, but, thanks to the diligence of many working in the human rights space, these gross abuses were identified and the system was shamed into compassion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the government now argues Border Force needs these powers, the truth is we already have laws and policies to deal with the issues the government seeks to address via this bill. These include extensive search and seizure powers under the Migration Act, common law duty of care to ensure the safety of people detained, and the ability of police to investigate any suspected illegal activity. In this context, I would argue law enforcement officers are the most appropriate executers as of these powers and it is not appropriate to delegate them to those working in and around detention facilities. Detention offices can and do work with police when incidents arise because it is rightly the role of police to investigate suspected misconduct, not Border Force, not employees of the private company Serco and not those employed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From a human rights perspective, this legislation also sets a dangerous precedent that ultimately could be applied elsewhere in society in the future, and, while this government may say this is an absurd statement, history is littered with societies that have initially made a law to support an exception to the rule, only to find in future years that the exception slips and it is applied to everyone. The bill also strengthens the powers to search for, screen, seize and retain prohibited and controlled items without a warrant and will allow for searches within centres, including the use of detector dogs to search the premises. While the government claim they've safeguarded the interests of detainees by making minor changes to the 2020 version of this bill, these changes are indeed minor and do not address the key concerns raised earlier.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Specifically the bill inserts three new sections to the Morrison government's 2020 version: sections 251AA, 251AB and 251AC, plus some minor legislative notes. These changes include a requirement that an authorised officer search for, screen for or seize a prohibited thing only if the officer believes on reasonable grounds that such a search or seizure is necessary. Yet this is an extremely broad test, which will be easily met and may be applied to everyone currently held in detention regardless of whether they have a prior criminal record or not, essentially applying a general threat of punitive measures to all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill does provide for access to an alternative means of communication when a communications device is seized, but the safeguard leaves detainees at the mercy of their guards and facilities when it comes to contacting loved ones, supporting people, legal advisers and the world in general. Additionally it isn't clear what this alternative means of communication would even entail. For instance the bill states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The alternative means of communication must reasonably be sufficient to enable the detainee to:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(a) communicate with a member of the family unit of the detainee; or</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(b) communicate with any person outside the immigration detention facility for the purposes of:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Does this mean a communications device that enables an asylum seeker to communicate with just one member of their family will be provided but not one that enables them to contact their support team or communicate with a lawyer, a government contact or a journalist? It would seem so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately little has changed since the 2020 version of this bill. Back then many now in the current government spoke against the bill. I thank them for that, as many of the points they raised are still valid and have not been addressed in this iteration. Indeed the member for Macnamara, the current Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, said in 2020 that the bill was 'not about a proportionate response from government but about cruelty and politics', while the member for Moreton said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is my view that a 'prohibited thing' should be defined in the legislation and brought before the parliament rather than snuck in via regulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I could not agree more with his assertion at that time. The member then went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the fact that they've brought a bill before the parliament that includes such outrageously nebulous and sweeping powers is proof that the current and former ministers can't effectively manage those in their care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile the member for Scullin said there was 'no justification for blanket prohibitions'. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To simply assert the changed composition of the cohort of people now in immigration detention is no justification for an across-the-board approach without any differentiation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Cooper said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Labor unequivocally do not support phones being removed from detainees who have done nothing wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, then, does not address these issues, as mobile phones can still be removed from detainees who have done nothing wrong, the minister is again using the changed composition of the cohort of people in immigration detention as a justification for an across-the-board approach, a prohibited thing is still not defined in this legislation and it would seem that this proposal is still fundamentally about politics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In his second reading speech, the minister said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill responds to calls for action from the Australian Border Force, as well as external parties including the Australian Human Rights Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet this assertion is at the very least cheeky in that he is referring to the Human Rights Commission's report into conditions at a particular facility, the Yongah Hill Immigration Detention Centre. While the Human Rights Commission report did raise serious concerns over safety and care at Yongah Hill, it clearly stated that these concerns will not be resolved solely through tighter security measures. Rather the Human Rights Commissioner, Lorraine Finlay, who attended the facility and conducted the report, gave a far more nuanced assessment of the situation. She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The cohort of people entering immigration detention has changed significantly over the years. Drug infiltration and substance misuse is a multi-faceted and complex issue, one which cannot simply be resolved through tighter security measures. Access to essential health services, rehabilitation and meaningful activity must be urgently addressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That report then went on to make 33 recommendations to the Department of Home Affairs, of which the department accepted or partially agreed to 20 and disagreed with seven, with the remaining six requiring government consideration. The report also recommended that the government replace the current system of mandatory immigration detention with a case-by-case assessment process that takes individual circumstances into consideration. The government didn't accept that recommendation, instead noting that it requires government consideration and stating that assessments are already completed as fast as possible to 'facilitate the shortest possible timeframe for detaining people in immigration detention facilities'. If this is the case, why is the average time spent in immigration detention in Australia 565 days, compared to 49 days in the United States of America and 16 days in Canada?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To the commission's recommendation that the department review its operational instructions to focus on reducing the adverse impact on privacy and dignity of people subject to searches, the government responded that they had already address that recommendation. Similarly, to the recommendation that the department increase the provision of counselling and rehabilitation services and education to minimise harm and reduce demand for alcohol and other drugs, the department said that they had already addressed that recommendation. To the recommendation that the department review its policy on access to recognised programs of study or vocational training, with a view to enhancing opportunities for rehabilitation and reintegration, the department disagreed with the recommendation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to stand in this place and say that he's introducing this piece of punitive legislation in part as a response to calls from the Human Rights Commission is a selective appropriation of a very small part of what could have been a landmark report, had the government chosen to listen to and act on all of the recommendations. Ultimately, in relation to search powers, the Human Rights Commission was clear. They said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government should reform the search powers available to detention centre staff to allow for targeted personal searches and room searches to be conducted where there is reasonable suspicion that drugs are being concealed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The recommendation was really clear. It was to identify the concealment of drugs, not to remove mobile phones.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They go on to reiterate that, should enhanced search powers be made available to centre staff, any use of these powers should be adequately reported and periodically reviewed to identify and rectify any systemic improvements to the use of force in immigration detention. They then specifically state that the recommendation to reform search powers will not lead to any meaningful increase in safety without there being a more significant investment in engaging more people in detention in drug and alcohol counselling, harm minimisation, access to treatment and rehabilitation, and further education to highlight and discourage risky behaviours associated with drug use.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, they argued that it would be these investments that would have greater benefits for the behavioural management of the whole centre, rather than enhanced search powers or drug prevalence testing. Yet, conveniently, the government doesn't seem to have read that part. Instead, we have a repackaged Morrison-era migration policy that aims to remove one of the only lifelines for people in immigration detention to communicate with family, friends and the outside world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You can't help but wonder if there's a larger agenda here, particularly as mobile phones have been instrumental in documenting abuse and safety concerns within the detention centres and have given a voice to those living in these facilities. Removing them risks oppressing a detainee's ability to talk to journalists and advocates about the conditions in these facilities. For example, Behrouz Boochani, who spent seven years in immigration detention on Manus Island, used a mobile phone to document his experience, He said that mobile phones were a lifeline for detainees to communicate with family and lawyers. Similarly, the Biloela family used mobile phones when they were deported late at night to contact supporters and journalists, who in turn contacted lawyers, leading to an emergency injunction that saw their plane turned back midflight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many other uses of mobile phones in detention facilities, from corresponding with legal professionals to learning English, accessing personal photographs, accessing medical advice, viewing entertainment or exercise routines, and reading the news. Cutting people off would only make an already inhumane system even crueller. Ultimately, having advocated in this area now for almost a decade, I have to believe that, as a nation and a community, we are better than this. Our government should be creating laws that ensure those in immigration detention are treated with dignity, are processed in a timely manner and do not suffer in dangerous environments. The first step should be the implementation of all the Human Rights Commission's recommendations on reforming immigration detention. The second step should be a royal commission into our treatment of asylum seekers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather than engaging in a race to the bottom on immigration, I call on this government to implement positive reforms that end the cruelty and human rights violations that have characterised Australia's detention regime since the 1990s. With just one week left in parliament, this is the second bill that this government is seeking to rush through that will limit people's human rights, and this bill will not make people living in detention, or detention centres themselves, safer. It will, however, make an already cruel system even crueller.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wouldn't have supported this bill when it was introduced by the Morrison government in 2020, and I will not support this version moved by the Albanese government. I say to this government: people expected better of you.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282335" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HAINES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:59</span>):  This bill, the Migration Amendment (Prohibiting Items in Immigration Detention Facilities) Bill 2024, seeks to resurrect a bill introduced by the previous coalition government. I make note of the words of the member for North Sydney and her detailed analysis of what we were presented with this morning when we had an eight o'clock briefing about this piece of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill seeks to allow the minister to determine, via a disallowable instrument, that an item is a 'prohibited thing' in relation to immigration detention facilities if the minister is satisfied that the thing is 'unlawful to possess' or if the thing would pose 'a risk to the health, safety or security' of a person in a facility, or 'the order of a facility'. The bill also strengthens Australian Border Force powers to search for, screen, seize and retain prohibited items when they believe, on reasonable grounds, that such search and seizure powers are necessary to prevent or lessen the risk to the health, safety or security of people in detention. This includes allowing Border Force officials to use detector dogs in searches.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does this bill do? The bill effectively gives the minister broad and discretionary powers to list things like phones and SIM cards as prohibited items. Secondly, it gives Australian Border Force officials working in detention centres powers to search for and seize these items from detainees if they reasonably believe it's necessary to prevent a risk to the safety of other people in detention, both detainees and workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this bill sounds familiar, it's because we have seen it before—not from a Labor government but from the former coalition Morrison government. Indeed, it was debated in 2020. I opposed that very similar bill then in 2020, and I oppose the bill before us today for similar reasons, which I'll address shortly. But before I do that, I want to note that in 2020 Labor opposed the bill. So why, you are likely wondering, are they now supporting it? Why the change of heart?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister is at pains to say that this bill is now necessary because the cohort in detention has shifted away from asylum seekers towards people who've had their visas cancelled on character grounds, many of whom have serious criminal histories. The government says that about 90 per cent of those in detention have a criminal history including a history of violent and drug related crimes. They say that these people are creating a prisonlike culture in immigration detention including a notable increase in drug trafficking and substance misuse, and regular threats of violence against other detainees. The Australian Border Force says that people in detention have been using encrypted messaging services to run organised criminal activities and that they've gone to the minister multiple times, apparently, to be given expanded powers to respond to this activity including powers to seize people's phones.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government say they've changed the coalitions previous bill to ensure that there are appropriate safeguards to allow detainees to access alternative means of communication when their mobile phones have been seized. This was the major reason they voted against the bill, and they say this concern has now been addressed in the bill before us. I understand that there should be measures to prevent drug trafficking and other criminal activity in detention—of course I do. Both detainees and those working in detention should be safe. Of course they should. But I have serious concerns about this bill presented to us today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, I am deeply concerned about the speed in which this government has rushed through this legislation. When I'm deciding whether to oppose or support a bill I ask, 'Is it good governance?' Good governance means good process. It means proper time for scrutiny, for consultation and even for negotiation. In the last sitting fortnight of the year the government have introduced the bill and have allowed one day of parliamentary debate. I only received a half-hour briefing from the minister this morning on the bill. It's not gone through the Senate inquiry, and I haven't had the time to consult with legal experts—including human rights experts, and refugee and asylum seeker lawyers—to determine exactly what this new bill does and to determine its impact on those in immigration detention. I need to know what the impacts of the bill are that I'm required to vote on. I can't support a bill where the government has not allowed adequate scrutiny for me to understand this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, I hold substantial worries about the broad and discretionary ministerial powers created under this bill. New section 251A of the bill, which allows the minister to determine a prohibited thing, is a very broad power. It means the minister could, and will, determine that mobile phone SIM cards and internet-capable devices are prohibited items. These items are lifelines for people held in immigration detention. They allow people to contact their families, to have access to lawyers and to have access to the media, not just for support but to uncover what conditions are like in these facilities. Giving the minister powers to prevent this access appears to me to be ministerial overreach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I quote Behrouz Boochani here, who spent seven years in immigration detention in Manus Island—the magnificent author, multi-award-winning journalist and filmmaker, who wrote the incredible <span style="font-style:italic;">No Friend But the Mountains</span>. If it were not for that phone, we would never have heard his voice. He used his phone to document his experience in many ways. One thing he said was that a phone allows people 'to communicate with their families, to be in touch with friends and also have access to lawyers'. He says: 'I used my phone to write about the system, to expose the system.' This incredible man wrote poetry in there. One extraordinary article he wrote was about the murder of his friend Reza Barati and the poem that he wrote for Reza on his phone, 'Our Mothers, a poem for Reza'. This is a man who won the Victorian Premier's prize for literature and so many other awards. There will be no more Behrouz Boochanis in our detention centres under this law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill risks greatly curtailing this right to access the outside world, and I am deeply concerned about it. I had the great honour of meeting with Behrouz Boochani, here, in this parliament—extraordinary, really. The irony of meeting him here, in February a couple of years ago, was not lost on me. What a powerful voice—a voice that would be silenced by this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government says the bill has adequate safeguards in place to ensure a detainee's right to communicate freely continues to be met. These include ensuring alternative means of communication are provided, where a phone has been confiscated, and ensuring that a phone can only be confiscated if an officer believes 'on reasonable grounds' that such search or seizure is necessary to prevent a risk to the health, safety or security of people in detention, or to the 'good order' of the facility—whatever that is defined as.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have two problems with these safeguards. First, we simply don't know what alternative means of communication will be provided. Are we talking about a landline, a fax? Likely, yes—hardly the equivalent of mobile phones and the internet, which are incredibly important accountability tools for sharing information, videos and photos about the poor conditions and mistreatment in detention. And we know there's mistreatment. The safeguards in this bill are simply not sufficient to ensure that this accountability can happen in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, I'm concerned about what 'good order' of the facility means. I understand it's not defined in legislation. I'm again concerned that this could result in an overreach of the powers because it gives the minister and officers significant discretion to determine what constitutes 'order' and to either list an item as prohibited or exercise search and seizure powers. It could mean that detainees' phones are confiscated to prevent riots or other forms of unrest that we know happen when conditions deteriorate and people feel completely powerless to have their voices heard. Rather than improving these conditions, the powers under this bill could just make these conditions worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third reason I oppose this bill is because, put simply, immigration detention is not prison. I quote barrister and Western Sydney university immigration law lecturer Dr Jason Donnelly, who says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Detention centres are for an administrative function, they are not prisons and if they are indeed a risk and if there's evidence they've committed a criminal offence then they'd be dealt with through Australia's criminal legal system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that police retain their powers to search for and seize items like phones and drugs that might put the safety of those in detention at risk. These powers already exist. We should not need to give them to border officers too.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here I quote, just as the member for North Sydney did, what some Labor members said in 2020 about this bill, or a very similar bill—when they spoke against, essentially, the same bill. The member for Makin said, at the time—and I was here:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Most of the things that the government wants to ban or confiscate are already illegal … and, as such, would be covered by existing state or federal laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If phones are being used for criminal activity, I believe that authorities would already have the ability to confiscate them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask members of the government now: what is different? Why does this statement from a member of your own government no longer seem to apply? It's another way this government seems to be competing with the opposition in their efforts to be the most hardline when it comes to immigration detention, to continue the race to the bottom on immigration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fourth reason I oppose the bill is the blanket nature in which it operates. Again, I'll quote a Labor member from 2020 when they opposed a similar bill. The member for Scullin, now the Minister for Skills and Training, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To simply assert the changed composition of the cohort of people now in immigration detention is no justification for an across-the-board approach without any differentiation. The minister says that these powers are required because, in his words, 'a large proportion of people in detention have criminal histories,' but that can be no justification for blanket prohibitions—for not treating people as individuals on their own terms and for not recognising the particular circumstances of medical transferees, asylum seekers and people who've overstayed their visas, for example.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He should be giving a speech today—exactly the same thing applies. Again, I ask the government, including the Minister for Skills and Training: what is so different now to make your government not just support but also introduce such a bill? The minister for immigration in his second reading speech said that this bill is so urgent now because of the change to the cohort of people in immigration detention. That's exactly what the coalition said in 2020, and Labor rightly called them out on it. To just take up this same argument four years later is, frankly, hypocritical.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to raise concerns about the government's utter failure to address the conditions in immigration detention, beyond the punitive measures in this bill. In his second reading speech, the minister said that this bill gives effect to one of the recommendations—one—of the Australian Human Rights Commission's report into the Yongah Hill Immigration Detention Centre near Perth. That report flagged serious concerns over safety and care at that immigration detention centre and made a recommendation to expand the search powers of staff. The government helpfully used that AHRC report to justify this bill, but what they failed to do is address any of the other 32 recommendations in the report. Recommendations included replacing the current system of mandatory detention completely and ensuring detention is used only as a last resort. Another one said that the department should increase the provision of counselling, rehabilitation services and education to minimise harm and reduce demand for alcohol and other drugs within the detained population at the centre. Another one was that the department should improve health services, including referrals and screening for mental health and cognitive disability, and there were many more. But, when asked this morning what the status of all these other recommendations made by the Human Rights Commission is, the minister responded that he didn't know. To me, this goes to show that this government is not taking a humane human rights approach to those in immigration detention. Instead, it is continuing punitive measures in a place that is not a prison.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to finish by quoting my own 2020 speech on the very similar bill introduced by the then coalition government. I can't believe I'm saying it again, but here I am. I said then:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I rise to express deep and sincere concerns about the Migration Amendment (Prohibiting Items in Immigration Detention Facilities) Bill 2020, the lack of evidence upon which it stands and the disturbing signal it sends about our collective values. I stand to give voice to the people from my electorate of Indi who have implored me to speak in this place about bills such as this. More than that, though, I stand to give voice to the very people who are rendered voiceless by bills such as this, bills which seek to take away not just a phone but what last shred of connection they have to a world outside the darkness they find themselves in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I stand by those words today, just as I stood by those words then. I am deeply, deeply troubled by this legislation and deeply disappointed in this government for bringing it to the House in the manner in which it has.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="182468" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THISTLETHWAITE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Immigration</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:16</span>):  The TAFE system is the largest educational institution in Australia. It's a publicly funded and publicly administered technical and further education institution that has served our nation well. It's older than the university system. They were established in the 19th century originally as schools of technology and the arts. Then, post the World War, they transitioned into the technical colleges as we know them today. TAFE has been a hallmark of Australia's apprenticeship and trainee system, which has served our nation well. It's a system that has generated international acclaim and has been studied and replicated in other developed nations as the gold standard for training apprentices and people in technical trades.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, like most nations at the moment, we have a shortage of skills. This shortage of skills is a handbrake on economic growth and growing productivity. In the current environment, where we have that shortage of skills, TAFE comes to the fore, because TAFE is the public education system through which we train our apprentice carpenters, plumbers, builders—apprentices for all sorts of different technical and trades based occupations. They all train through the TAFE system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we want to make sure we can build the houses of the future to meet the challenges that we have around supply, we need to make sure that we're training more apprentices in the TAFE system with those qualifications. And that is exactly what the Free TAFE Bill is about. It's about recognising that the TAFE system will meet the challenge of training the next generation of tradies. It's also about locking in accessibility to TAFE for those who want to study there in the future. We've had great success with the policies that were introduced by the Albanese government of fee-free TAFE in certain areas, predominantly where we've had skills shortages. We're now extending that and making it permanent because it has been delivering better results for the Australian economy and better training outcomes for those who want to take on technical and further education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's fee-free TAFE ensures that young Australians have access to quality training without the burden of a debt holding them back. In an environment with a tight cost of living, the decision whether or not you can pay the rent, afford groceries and undertake tertiary education is a reasonable one. For many young Australians the cost and the burden associated with taking on additional training may be too much. Well, this government removes that burden and that cost through this legislation. That will create opportunities for young Australians to study, to get those qualifications and to have good jobs and a brighter future. Many of them will go on to establish businesses of their own and employ other Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the community that I represent, we have Randwick TAFE. It's been an institution when it comes to training young apprentices and trainees in a whole host of industries in the eastern suburbs of Sydney for many, many decades. Despite the previous Liberal government's attempts to rationalise and to reduce the number of courses that were available at Randwick TAFE, we're seeing a resurgence in available opportunities and courses for young people to study. It's where students develop their skills and secure their future, and under our legislation they won't have to worry about a heavy debt burden weighing them down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why we're taking this next step of making fee-free TAFE permanent. Through this legislation we'll guarantee 100,000 fee-free TAFE places across Australia every year. That builds on the government's partnership with the states and territories which delivered 180,000 fee-free TAFE places in 2023. The reason why we're doing it is that the results have been good and the results have demonstrated that the policy is working as it was intended to and returning dividends for the Australian people and for industry. More than 500,000 Australians have already enrolled in fee-free TAFE courses, and fee-free TAFE is reaching the people who need it most, with 170,000 young Australians, 124,000 jobseekers and 30,000 First Nations Australians getting a start through TAFE. Sixty per cent of these places have been taken up by women and a third by people in regional and remote Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We talk about trying to produce outcomes that help with the skills shortage and that provide training and opportunities for women, for First Nations Australians and for people living in the regions, and this policy is delivering that. That's why we're investing further in it. The numbers tell a powerful story. Fee-free TAFE is breaking down barriers to education and creating life-changing opportunities. It's remarkable and it's almost unbelievable that the opposition would oppose a policy such as this, particularly in the environment of a skills shortage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition's record on TAFE shows their complete lack of understanding of its value to the Australian people. Their sneering at vocational education reveals an ideology that is out of touch with everyday Australians. If they had their way, access to TAFE would be cut, leaving many locked out of the skills and qualifications they need to secure well-paid jobs. We saw this happening the last time they were in government: a disregard for the vocational education and training system. I see this in New South Wales, in the state that I am from, where the previous Liberal government ripped the heart out of proper funding for public vocational education and training through the TAFE colleges. We saw a rationalisation of courses at various institutions that resulted in a decrease in the number of people taking on apprenticeships and completing them, and we're all paying the price for that now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're paying the price through skills shortages in vital trades across the country, particularly the building trades. We wonder why we've got a shortage of housing in Australia and why the costs of building housing have increased so dramatically. It's because we haven't trained enough Australians over the last decade to hold those essential skills that are vital to building housing and indeed the infrastructure that will support population expansion throughout the country. So businesses have been forced to look overseas for workers because Australians weren't given the skills that they needed. That's what we've seen. Under the previous government, we saw a reduction in the number of people taking on apprenticeships and traineeships and an increase in the number of skilled workers imported into the country to fill those gaps, and we're in the process of trying to reverse that—trying to get it moving the other way, with an increase in the number of people taking on trades and a reduction in the numbers and the need for imported overseas labour. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we're making sure that every Australian gets access to the education and training that they deserve. We're investing in the skills needed to grow our economy while tackling workforce shortages in critical industries, and our Free TAFE Bill 2024 will help secure this future. It commits the Commonwealth to ongoing support for fee-free TAFE across the states and territories. It's not about locking the states into a rigid system. Instead, it builds on the strong partnerships we've developed in ensuring that fee free TAFE is tailored to meet those local and national needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It isn't just about education. It's about building a better future—removing financial barriers for Australians, particularly those who face economic disadvantage; providing cost-of-living relief for young Australians in particular, but also for older Australians who take on additional studies later in life and for families who need it most during a cost-of-living crunch; and delivering a coordinated response to workforce shortages in industries like health care, construction and renewable energy. Fee-free TAFE has already changed hundreds of thousands of lives. In just over 18 months, 508,000 Australians have enrolled, and they're in critical industries that will support economic growth into the future and are creating secure, well-paid jobs for Australians in priority areas. It's not just about investment in individuals; it's an investment, really, in future growth for our economy. We promised fee-free TAFE, and it's now here to stay. With this legislation, we are making a permanent commitment to ensuring that all Australians can access education and training.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's nothing further I need to say, funnily enough, because this bill is so good it speaks for itself. I commend it to the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms McKENZIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:29</span>):  As we begin the final sitting week of the year, which may well be the final sitting week of the 47th Parliament, there is a moment for reflection and gratitude. For many outside this place, it has been a very hard year. I see it and I hear it when walking along our retail and industrial zones across the Mornington Peninsula. A few weeks ago in Rye, a store owner selling sports and fishing gear said he was 50 per cent down on where he would normally be this time of year. Another explained to me business was slow, too slow to justify taking on new staff, while being mindful the summer months would be as demanding and crushing as ever albeit on winter staff ratios. Others have closed their doors for good, like our much-loved local boutique, Fashion by Bronwyn in Somerville. Bron started her boutique in March 1980 and finally closed her doors in June this year. About a year ago she sent me an email in which she said: 'In the late eighties we had that recession. I remember clearly what it was like—high interest rates and cost-of-living increases. Many people lost their houses, jobs and businesses, and you could not sell a house for months. I had to put my staff off and work six days a week just to pay the overheads. In the end, people were just so angry that we had the change of government, when the best prime minister we have ever had—John Howard—came to power. Gradually, in the nineties the economy improved and, as we know, he remained in power for many years. At the present time, I feel like we are going full circle. Business has dried up and people are tightening the belt to pay their mortgages and bills. I know I am saying what you already know but what a sad state of affairs our beautiful country is in.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed. In Flinders I have the most resilient community on earth and also the most generous. My community is made up of volunteers. It's in their blood, whether it is Rotary, Lions, Mens Shed, RSLs, local markets, art shows, footy, netball, cricket, basketball, baseball and soccer clubs, the sailing and bowling and petanque clubs—volunteerism, turn-upism, make-a-contributionism, having-a-go-ism is who we are in Flinders. We have the good fortune to live also in the most beautiful part of the world, with koalas, echidnas, banjo sharks, giant stingrays, weedy sea dragons and spider crabs likely to greet you on an afternoon walk or a morning swim. It is good for the mind and good for the soul to live amongst this nature. I was reminded of this on the weekend when I attended the Christmas celebration of the Mornington Peninsula koala conservation group, which this year, through the thick of winter, planted 25,000 trees to keep koalas content in our trees throughout the year. I thank this beautiful group and its leader, Dirk Jansen, for their tireless commitment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there's one man in this Christmas message that I want to specially want to recognise tonight. In my parting message to the Peninsula for this year to celebrate the end of the year from this place, this chamber, and that man is John Prentice, president of the Sorrento Portsea RSL. On Saturday night at the RSL's thank you party for members and volunteers, John Prentice passed the presidency baton to Peter Remevicus after more than a decade leading our club. John turned 79 this year. He is a retired civil engineer and a National Service Vietnam vet. John was awarded life membership of the RSL more than a decade ago in recognition of his efforts in resurrecting the Sorrento Portsea RSL sub branch following its closure due to uneconomic operations in late 2007.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When John took over the RSL it had less than 100 members. On Saturday night we celebrated more than one thousand members. Under John's leadership, the Sorrento Portsea facility has become a thriving, multi-engaged community facility that serves the entire southern Mornington Peninsula. The RSL hosts music events, from the weekly Tom Cat's performance to Fleetwood Mac and INXS revival tribute bands. It welcomes the Southern Peninsula Probus Club and has had many a celebration of its dear members' lives. The sub branch supports local schools and provides bursaries to high performing primary school children and it willingly supports state wide causes like the 2019-20 bushfires and the 2022 Rochester floods. This little RSL is now the largest by turnover and membership in category B licenced without poker machines in the Victorian RSL network. It's 1,048 members isn't bad for a township that has just over 2,000 permanent residents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John and his wife, Jenny's, efforts have been hands-on and sustained and considerably above and beyond what anyone could expect of unremunerated volunteers. John's efforts are all the more remarkable given his ongoing battle with cancer and associated frequent chemotherapy treatments since he was first diagnosed more than a decade ago. In a time when there are equal challenges in my family, can I say it was so great to see him in all his Hawaiian shirt glory on Saturday night. He's a fine example of everything that is so good about the Mornington Peninsula—no self-indulgence, just getting on with the job of bringing world-recognised talent to our little community and making it better, not just by his presence and toil but by his very spirit. May it continue long in our midst. Merry Christmas, John and Jenny Prentice, and Merry Christmas Mornington Peninsula.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LIM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:34</span>):  I love doorknocking. To me, it is the best barometer to understand the issues and challenges that matter most to my community. As I've doorknocked hundreds and hundreds of homes from Canning Vale to Bicton, here is a question I often get asked: 'Sam, what have you done from the last two years?' Well, here's my book, my homework. I will always give it to them and say, 'Please have a read.' I give them this book. I am so proud to serve the community of Tangney, and for the past two years I have delivered many positive changes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tangney is one of the most diverse communities in Australia. With more than 160 different ancestries, this multiculturalism deserves to be nurtured. I have delivered on commitments including a $1 million contribution to the Perth Hindu Temple in Canning Vale so it can grow and expand. I've also delivered a $1.75 million contribution towards the construction of the new Chung Wah Community Centre. Community language learning in Tangney is thriving. As someone who speaks to my children and grandchildren in our home language of Chinese Mandarin, I'm so proud of the teachers and parents and children who are committed to learning some of our community's many languages. Grants were given to 13 community language schools to serve more than 1,400 students in Tangney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The environment is a top concern. I have schoolchildren writing to me with their bold ideas and community groups focused on different areas of climate action. We have invested $10 million to better protect and preserve the Canning, Southern and Wungong Rivers, with a further $3.5 million invested to protect the ecological health of the Swan-Canning Estuary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For many parents, including myself, education is everything. The agreement with the WA Labor government to invest an additional $1.6 billion to fully fund all WA public schools is so important. In Tangney, our Labor government has made additional investments in local schools for upgraded facilities. One school that received an upgrade is Applecross Senior High School, which also won the 2024 WA Education Award for excellence in teaching and learning for a secondary school. I recently celebrated World Teacher's Day at Applecross Senior High School. It's clear from the teachers, support staff, parents and leadership to the dedicated students that this award is well-deserved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Community is at the heart of Tangney. More than $120,000 in volunteer grants has been delivered to 46 not-for-profit organisations across Tangney. These grants assist sports clubs, church groups, service clubs like the Lions and St Vincent de Paul. The Melville Community Men's Shed is about to undergo renovation with a $250,000 investment. The Men's Shed has been pivotal for addressing mental health and fostering connection.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that community sport is essential for connection and wellbeing. I have delivered on lighting upgrades for Melville City Hockey Club to help the club have adequate facilities to play at night. The resurfacing of the netball courts at Karoonda Reserve for the Tingara Netball Club helps many of the women and girls playing netball. There are new cricket nets for the Applecross Cricket Club and new shade sails for Murdoch University Melville Cricket Club. The new glass panels for the squash court at Blue Gum Park Tennis Club in Brentwood are especially exciting given the club's junior success.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is, of course, more to do, and, just as I have every day, I look forward to continuing to work hard to serve and deliver for the people of Tangney.</span>

Since late 2021, this idea has gained significant support, and, as the member for Durack, I have been a very strong advocate for this vision since its inception and I remain convinced that a jetty would be a game changer for Geraldton.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Geraldton is much more than just any old coastal city. It's a vital hub for regional industries, like mining, fishing, grain and sheep production. It is also a key player in Western Australia's tourism landscape, serving as the gateway to the stunning north-west and the incredible Abrolhos Islands, a pristine natural wonder that many consider our crown jewel. Geraldton is a city on the rise. Since the pandemic, more Australians have sought the benefits of regional living, and Geraldton has been leading the way. In fact, recent data from the Regional Australia Institute showed it was the fastest growing regional city in the country during the 2022-23 period.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With this rapid growth, of course, comes an opportunity and a responsibility to invest in infrastructure that will enhance both the lifestyle of our residents and the appeal of our city as a destination. A jetty for Geraldton is one such investment, and the overwhelming community support for this project is undeniable, with the Jetty for Geraldton community Facebook group amassing 7,000 followers and growing. Their passion for a jetty has energised residents across Geraldton and the surrounding area. This is not just some pipe dream; it is a practical, achievable vision that would provide significant benefits to both locals and visitors. The draft designs for the jetty show that it has been carefully planned to be environmentally sensitive, ensuring it will complement the natural beauty of our coastline while creating a legacy that future generations can enjoy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A jetty provides something for everybody—a place for families to walk, fish or just watch the sunset. Geraldton has the best sunsets, let me assure you, Deputy Speaker. It would be somewhere for teenagers to swim and gather safely with their friends or for older residents just to go for stroll, socialise and take in the coastal beauty. For those who may not be able to swim, including perhaps those with a disability, it's a way to connect with the water in a safe and accessible way. Beyond its social value, a jetty would be a powerful driver of tourism. Geraldton already has much to offer visitors, but this would add something truly special to our city, and, with our amazing foreshore, the jetty would be the icing on the cake.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Across Australia, jetties are proven attractions that draw people in, from locals enjoying the ocean breeze to tourists seeking that perfect photo opportunity. Busselton, in the electorate of my dear friend the member for Forrest, Nola Marino, have a shining example in their city. Their iconic jetty has been a key driver of local business and tourism. Having met regularly with the Jetty for Geraldton community group, I've seen their dedication and their belief in this project's ability to transform Geraldton. Their leader, local Mark O'Brien, is to be commended for his vision, passion and drive. The concept here is clear: the jetty would encourage greater outdoor engagement, strengthen the bonds within our community and create new opportunities for tourism growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very pleased the City of Greater Geraldton recently committed $50,000 for an initial feasibility study. Of course, this is a key step to making this community vision a reality. In fact, tomorrow afternoon, the council will consider their jetty business case options analysis report for the first time, the outcome of which will shape the project's future. The council's report also states that a jetty would contribute to increasing the liveability of Geraldton and that it would support the community and our youth by promoting physical and mental wellbeing. These are just some of the benefits outlined within the City of Greater Geraldton's report.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A jetty for Geraldton is an opportunity to create something lasting and meaningful for Geraldton. I'm determined to continue my fight for this project, because I believe in its potential to bring people together, boost our economy and make Geraldton an even better place to live and visit for generations to come. Quite simply, Geraldton deserves better.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gorton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:44</span>):  A former member of this place, Pete Steedman, passed away on 10 July. He was 80 years old. In 1983, Pete was elected as member for Casey and was part of the first Hawke government that sat in Old Parliament House. As I missed the opportunity to speak on his condolence motion, I wanted to record my sympathies and sincere condolences to his family and his many friends. I also wanted to place in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> a record of his achievements. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was fortunate enough to attend and speak at a large gathering at Victorian Trades Hall on Saturday 7 September to celebrate his life. On the day, I reflected on the influence that Pete had had upon the people around him, upon the labour movement and upon the Labor Party. But his political activism started well before his arrival in Canberra. In fact, he was first known for being editor of Monash University's student newspaper, <span style="font-style:italic;">Lot's Wife</span>, in the mid-1960s.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">

                  </a>  Hear, hear!</span>
              </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr O'CONNOR:</span>
                  </a>  That's right. There are a couple of alumni here. This was, of course, during the early days of Monash University and during the emergence of social movements and the growing opposition to the Vietnam War. Whether it was protesting against conscription for young men or fighting for Indigenous land rights, Pete was at the forefront of many of these social movement activities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At Trades Hall in September, Gareth Evans, a senior cabinet minister in the Hawke and Keating governments, was in attendance. He recounted his success in convincing Pete to move to the University of Melbourne and become editor of its student newspaper, <span style="font-style:italic;">Fa</span><span style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">rago</span>. So he had the quinella—the only person to hold the editorial roles of both universities. Later on, of course, he became managing editor of <span style="font-style:italic;">Oz</span> magazine, which was subject to prosecution in London for what were then seen to be obscenities. It's a good reminder of how repressive things were back in those days. These experiences sharpened Pete's journalistic and political skills, which he used so effectively for the rest of his life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But he was a victim of the fickle fate of politics, losing the 1984 election, owing in particular to a brutal redistribution of his seat. He then moved on to assist the Municipal Employees' Union, where I got to know him relatively well. He was a really important conduit for the union in engaging with the federal government. At the time, we had just won a work value case for home carers, but we needed Commonwealth funding. Through the efforts of Pete Steedman, I managed, at the age of 25, to meet Paul Keating in the Old Parliament House in 1987, which was a great bonus for the members of that union, the home-care workers who were being paid so little.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, that echoes what we do now: we increase and improve wages for low-paid workers and then make sure the Commonwealth funds them. That's exactly what Keating did, but it was in large part due to Pete Steedman's advocacy, which I won't forget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="86256" type="MemberInterjecting">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">Mr Hill:</span>
                  </a>  You're running out of time to talk about his house parties.</span>
              </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr O'CONNOR:</span>
                  </a>  Some of the best parties that were ever conducted in my lifetime were held at his place in Hurstbridge, which he had purchased from David Williamson, the playwright. We used to have these Guy Fawkes days where from 60 and up to 100 people would turn up. Starting at lunchtime, they would culminate in a bonfire and fireworks display. There'd be an effigy, and the effigy was never representative of Guy Fawkes. It was always a political rival who had crossed Pete that year. They were remarkable days. We had a wonderful time with Pete and Julie and his family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a sad day when Pete passed, but he had a glorious life and he did some remarkable things, including establishing Ausmusic to cultivate, promote and elevate local Australian music. Every November is Ausmusic month, and we can thank Pete Steedman, and others, for ensuring that. He got together the musicians and strategic minds of the likes of Michael Gudinski and really elevated that. Pete was a remarkable character. They broke the mould when they made him, but he will always be remembered as a decent, remarkable Labor man.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265991" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LLEW O'BRIEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wide Bay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:49</span>):  The year 2024 is almost over, and, looking back on the year that's been, one of the biggest highlights for Wide Bay, and one that will save lives, is the long-awaited opening of the Gympie Bypass. The new 26-kilometre corridor completes the Cooroy to Curra four-lane upgrade and transforms one of the deadliest sections of the Bruce Highway into one of the safest. But there is still much to do, and we need to extend that four-lane divided highway north of Curra to Maryborough. I'll be working with the new LNP state government to get cracking on the Tiaro Bypass and everything in between.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">2024 has been a tough year for Wide Bay's community service and sporting groups, with rising costs having an impact on their capacity to deliver programs and services which so many people rely on. With the Labor government slashing the funding and opportunities for not-for-profit organisations, programs like the volunteer grants are vital. The volunteer grants program supports the work volunteers undertake in the community, providing funding for equipment and training to make their work easier, safer and more enjoyable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Local organisations like the Gympie and Pomona and District Meals on Wheels, Gympie Medical Transport and the Volunteer Coast Guard at Tin Can Bay received grants to provide fuel reimbursements for their volunteers, who use their own vehicles to help others. The Proud Marys, Curra Country Club, Murgon Mustangs Junior Rugby League and the South Burnett PCYC used their funds to train and upskill their volunteers and conduct child safety background checks. The Cherbourg Ration Shed used their grant to purchase sewing and craft equipment to create artwork that continues to tell the story of life in Cherbourg under the Aboriginal protection act. Riding for the Disabled Maryborough are building a ramp for their riders to use when mounting and dismounting. The Baddow Scout Group bought a branded marquee, and the Gympie Pistol Club purchased a ride-on mower. A number of organisations—like the Cooroora Historical Society, the Maryborough Military Aviation Museum, the Noosa District Basketball Association, the Creative Country Association, Kandanga Cemetery, the Widgee District Hall &amp; Recreation Association, the Bauple Band Hall, Maryborough Regional Arts Council, Friends of Amamoor and the Maryborough Speedway—used their grants to purchase furniture, computers, tools, and safety and maintenance equipment to support the great work that they do for the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The volunteers and staff at the Wide Bay RSL sub-branch also do an incredible job supporting veterans and their families. I congratulate the Murgon and Gympie sub-branches on receiving funding from the Veteran Wellbeing Grants Program during 2024. The Murgon veterans drop-in centre, which was funded as an election commitment of mine in 2019, is upgrading its outdoor area, which will be great for those who utilise the facility.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:53</span>):  Next month, December this year, marks 50 years since Cyclone Tracy devastated Darwin on 24 December and in the early hours of Christmas Day in 1974. It killed at least 66 people and destroyed more than 70 per cent of Darwin's buildings, including 80 per cent of its homes. It was our worst peacetime disaster in modern times until the devastating Black Saturday bushfires in 2009. It was also the largest peacetime evacuation in Australia's history. Over 25,000 people were evacuated by air, and more than 7,000 Territorians left by road. One week later, only 10,000 people remained in Darwin, and the Darwin community rallied together to start cleaning up and rebuilding the city. Our Australian Defence Force was a part of this response and relief work, as Dr Tom Lewis has written about in his new book called <span style="font-style:italic;">Cyclone Warriors</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the start of the cyclone season this month, this anniversary serves as a stark reminder of the need for robust disaster preparedness and response measures, many of which were established in the wake of Cyclone Tracy. It's a reminder to have your family plan ready to go and a good emergency cyclone kit also at the ready.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 50th anniversary of Cyclone Tracy is a significant national event. Despite being 50 years ago, it is still very raw in the Darwin community for those that were there and survived that night. That's why I'm working with the Northern Territory government, the City of Darwin and the broader community to commemorate this event, and that's why the Albanese Labor government committed $600,000 to deliver a permanent memorial at East Point, with the Remembering Cyclone Tracy group, to mark the anniversary but also a contribution towards a commemorative installation at Bundilla.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been some disquiet about the design of the City of Darwin project, and I acknowledge there is a variety of views how best to mark the event. This is the 50th anniversary, after all, of a very traumatic event which no physical memorial could ever really truly reflect. But I will continue to support the telling of stories and significant places, like the bent-in-half and twisted power poles at Casuarina secondary college, which are a profound reminder of the fury of the wind that night—that the wind could bend iron power poles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">East Point will have a dedicated space for the memorial by the water where Cyclone Tracy made landfall. To mark this chapter in our history, that will be a place where survivors and their families can visit to remember, reflect and heal. This, coupled with the new exhibition at the Museum and Art Gallery of the NT, will be a place where visitors and new Territorians can learn about this tragedy and pay their respects. The updated exhibition is opening on 7 December.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With others, I approached the Royal Australian Mint to commission a commemorative coin to mark the 50th anniversary of Cyclone Tracy. They would not agree to do so, unfortunately, arguing that it was only a Northern Territory issue rather than a national event. That is wrong, wrong, wrong! In 1974, Australia faced a series of natural disasters. They were absolutely unprecedented at the time and they culminated in Cyclone Tracy on Christmas Eve. At the beginning of that year, the east coast was battered by torrential rain, with 6,700 homes in Brisbane inundated with water, and the 1974 bushfire season was the worst Australia had faced in 30 years. So not only was Tracy a national event in that the nation responded and took people from Darwin into their homes all around the country but also it changed the way in which the Commonwealth responded to natural disasters. It really was a national event. The Whitlam government created the Darwin reconstruction authority to rebuild Darwin. It was planned to take five years, but Territorians cracked on and got it done in three years. This leadership means most buildings in Darwin are now built to withstand a category 5 cyclone. It certainly was an event of national significance and, with the help of the people of Australia, we rebuilt Darwin to be the incredible place it is today.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="144732" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PAYNE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:59</span>):  I rise to support the Free TAFE Bill because I know that TAFE changes lives. TAFE is the beating heart of Australia's vocational education and skills training. Its importance cannot be overstated. It is a powerhouse of opportunity, equipping millions of Australians with the practical skills and qualifications that they need to thrive in the workforce. For the nation, TAFE creates a highly skilled population, making an invaluable contribution to our nation's economy and society. In a world that is rapidly changing, with new technologies reshaping industries, our TAFE system is critical. It equips Australians with the expertise and adaptability to meet the challenges of the future head on. Whether it's training our healthcare workers, electricians, mechanics, hospitality staff or IT professionals, TAFE creates the skilled workforce that keeps our country running and competitive on the global stage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill expands our government's commitment to the skills sector. It is transformational. It will support the delivery of at least 100,000 full-time places across Australia each year from 2027, when the current fee-free TAFE agreement ends. It cements TAFE at the heart of the vocational education and training sector. Its practical impact is profound. It removes financial barriers to education and training, particularly for those experiencing economic disadvantage. It targets areas of high workforce demand, emerging skills needs and national and state or territory priorities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since we introduced fee-free TAFE 18 months ago, we've seen 508,000 enrolments in the program. This is a testament to its popularity, necessity and success. Ongoing fee-free TAFE will offer greater certainty to students, employers and industry, as well as the states and territories. At a time when cost-of-living pressures are real for so many Australians, this bill provides relief by removing the financial barriers that prevent people from accessing education and training. Fee-free TAFE is popular. Fee-free TAFE is working. And, under Labor, fee-free TAFE will continue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A few weeks ago, the Minister for Skills and Training and I visited the Canberra Institute of Technology, CIT, campus in Bruce, here in my electorate of Canberra. We met nursing and early childhood education students benefiting from their fee-free courses. Their passion for learning and their excitement for their future careers was truly inspiring. The difference fee-free TAFE has made to them is incredible, and we're making the decision that this will continue for the long term. We met a refugee from Afghanistan who was building a new life through TAFE. We heard from a Navy veteran who was retraining for a civilian career. We spoke with young Australians brimming with optimism about their future. This is what fee-free TAFE is about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to take this moment to talk a little bit about CIT here in Canberra. Last year, CIT marked 95 years of education in our city. It was founded in 1928 as the Telopea Park technical trades school and, at the time, was opened by the Prime Minister, Stanley Bruce. Today, almost a century on, CIT spans five campuses, is the peak public vocational education and training provider in the ACT and educates around 20,000 students every year. With two Labor governments, both here in this place and in the territory, it is an exciting time to be involved in vocational education and training.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we came to government, we acted fast to implement the landmark 12-month skills agreement. The ACT government was quick to sign on, leading to an injection of more than $16.5 million into the ACT skills and training sector. This initially supported more than 2,500 fee-free TAFE places at CIT. Another 4,400 students enrolled in these fee-free courses in the last financial year, with almost another 4,000 places available in the next few years, when the measures proposed in the bill would take effect. That represents an additional $8.86 million from 2024 to 2026. I am genuinely so proud of the huge take-up of fee-free TAFE in my electorate. For the students, this represents savings of thousands of dollars every year, along with lifelong skills which will set them up for the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also incredibly proud to stand alongside the former minister for skills, the member for Gorton, Brendan O'Connor, and ACT Minister Chris Steel to announce, at CIT, the first TAFE centre of excellence in the country. This centre of excellence is for electric vehicles and is already providing world-class training for the EV jobs of the future. This is building on the existing success of CIT's electrical vehicle training hub at the Fyshwick campus here in my electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the take-up of EVs increases, it's so important that we have the workforce that is able to service and maintain them. The Canberra TAFE centre of excellence at CIT is educating that workforce right now, providing fantastic skills training right here in Canberra thanks to the Albanese government's commitment to skills and training. This TAFE centre of excellence at CIT in Canberra is bringing in students from all around the country who want to take advantage of this incredible training hub for those jobs of the future in electric vehicles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is interesting and disappointing, although not surprising, is the reaction to this bill from those opposite. It's hardly a shock that they're opposing this bill; it is literally all they do in this place. They genuinely must be the least constructive opposition in history. You would think, though, on a bill that would make vocational education accessible to more Australians that they might take a different approach. The coalition love to pretend they're on the side of tradies, and they love to pretend that they're here to fight for battlers, but, when push comes to shove, they revert to type and act as a blocker to the economic prosperity, education and life-changing impacts of Australians who have benefited from the policies of the Albanese Labor government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The deputy leader of the Liberal Party called investment in our TAFE sector 'wasteful spending'. I wonder if she would be so bold as to say that to the faces of the hundreds of thousands of students enrolled in one of these popular courses in the incredibly important skills areas for our economy. I wonder if she would say that to the educators, the councils or the communities that TAFEs support around the nation. But it is true to form, given the decade of neglect, cuts and indifference to TAFE that the Liberals presided over.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Something I wasn't expecting, though, was the mental gymnastics that some of those opposite would perform to mock and criticise my constituents in order to oppose the bill. I happened to catch some of the member for Nicholls's contribution on this bill. He said that Canberra is a taxpayer funded region and that people here are paid for by his constituents. He said that his constituents make their own money through their efforts, whereas mine apparently don't. I would never attack the member for Nicholls's constituents, but, unfortunately, this is something I see all the time as the member for Canberra, particularly from those opposite. It's somehow an attack on government because public servants live here and because we are the nation's capital and it's a pretty easy win to criticise our city and our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very proud of what is happening with TAFE, or CIT as it's known in Canberra, and the huge take-up that we have seen in this city around our fee-free TAFE. That will be continuing because TAFE breaks down barriers. Whether you're from rural or regional Australia, whether you're looking to retrain after a job loss or whether you're a school leaver who might not see university as the right fit for you, TAFE offers you a path to success. It empowers women, people with disabilities and those from disadvantaged backgrounds to fully participate in the economy. The Australian economy relies on skilled workers. From the construction industry to renewable energy, from aged care to advanced manufacturing, so many industries are powered by people who have honed their craft through vocational training.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Investing in TAFE is not just about investing in education; it's about investing in Australia's future economic prosperity. Every dollar spent on skills training has a multiplier effect, boosting productivity, innovation and competitiveness. By expanding our commitment to fee-free TAFE, we're addressing skills shortages. By expanding funding, improving facilities and supporting Australians undertaking their apprenticeships, we can fill critical gaps in industries like nursing, early childhood education, engineering and green energy. TAFE graduates are job ready from day one, capable of meeting the demands of the workforce with hands-on experience and practical know-how. Labor backs them, Labor backs opportunity, Labor backs our skills sector and Labor backs TAFE—including our CIT here in Canberra.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, it was truly wonderful to meet some students when I visited CIT in Bruce a few weeks ago with the Minister for Skills and Training to hear about the difference fee-free TAFE was making to them. As I mentioned, one woman we met was a refugee from Afghanistan undertaking a degree in early childhood education. We saw how she was able to work in the community in this in-demand area. Again, Labor has supported recognition and a proper pay rise for these highly skilled and dedicated early childhood educators, which is long overdue. As a mother with children in early childhood education, I am in awe of the job they do every day. This enabled her to undertake that important education and to pursue a career in that area. Another woman we met was a refugee from Sudan who was also undertaking an early childhood education degree.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also met some nursing students. One was a former Navy officer wanting to retrain in nursing. The fee-free TAFE had made that a reality for her. As a single parent, not having to pay those fees was really helpful for her to be able to undertake that degree. It was really inspiring to meet with some of the teachers at the Bruce campus of CIT as well and hear about the great opportunities for education there, the equipment used to teach nursing. It was all very good to see that we are getting behind these important educational institutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also had the pleasure to several times visit the electric vehicle training hub at the Fyshwick campus of CIT and talk to mechanics who were training in electric vehicles and hear in particular about the safety element. As we see more and more electric vehicles on the road, we will need to have people trained in how to deal with accidents or malfunctions, as well as mechanics to service and repair those vehicles, including heavy vehicles. We met a mixture of students there, some young people beginning in these areas that they were so passionate about, and established mechanics learning these new skills as our economy transitions towards more electric vehicles being sold. The ACT has some of the highest take-up of electric vehicles in the country, so it is fitting that we have this hub here. As I said, it is building on what our wonderful CIT, the Canberra Institute of Technology, was already doing. I was proud that the Albanese Labor government chose for this to be the first national TAFE centre of excellence in the country—right here in Canberra.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm really proud that our government is backing TAFE, including CIT here in Canberra. I know that fee-free TAFE will change so many lives, enabling people who may not have been able to afford these opportunities to undertake them. That is the transformative power of education, and Labor will always want to make it as accessible as we can to everyone. This is what fee-free TAFE is about, and I'm really pleased it would continue under a re-elected Labor government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take this quick opportunity to acknowledge the incredible work of the member for Gorton, the former minister for skills, who began work on fee-free TAFE when he was minister and delivered it. He has made such an incredible contribution to this parliament and will be much missed, as he is retiring at the next election.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:29</span>):  In a year plagued with cost-of-living issues, persistent inflation and record high energy bills, our community in Fowler continues to move forward, even though this government continually forget us. Our community in Fowler is one of the most multiculturally diverse electorates in the country, with 67 per cent speaking a language other than English at home and 54.7 per cent having been born overseas, many having come to Australia with the aim of providing their families with greater opportunities and better access to education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the many students in Fowler, 18 December is a day that will officially represent the conclusion of their high school journey. Whilst many will go on to university, it's also important to consider the many students who will pursue different pathways, such as vocational training in the manufacturing and construction industries. Having gone through the pressures of high school exams and the transition to university myself, I want to wish all students in Fowler and across the state the best of luck with their exam results and leave you all with a short message. Your results do not define who you are and what you will go on to achieve. Whatever the outcome on the 18th, don't be disheartened, and continue to do your best.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Continuing on the theme of the role education plays in Fowler, November saw the 50th anniversary of the Diqlat Assyrian School. The school has been a longstanding pillar of the Assyrian-Australian committee, providing assistance and education to students over the course of 50 years. It was an honour to be part of the celebrations, seeing past and present teachers who've dedicated themselves to preserving the Assyrian language and culture. I'd like to thank Dr Ben Daoud, President of the Assyrian Australian Association, for including me in this significant celebration, and I wish them all the best in their future endeavours.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also recently joined the celebrations of the Iraq community in Fowler, further highlighting the diverse communities that reside in the electorate. It was an honour to come together and celebrate Iraqi  culture, traditions and people. I am continually proud of our amazing community. Thank you to Laith Al Uboodi for reaching out to my office and including me in the celebration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my community of Fowler, Christmas lights have started to twinkle and shape across many homes, and I'm sure many members have started to hear all the wonderful Christmas tunes playing in stores. In what has been a challenging year for many residents of Fowler, Christmas is an opportunity for families to come together and celebrate togetherness. For many, the ongoing cost-of-living crisis will make Christmas a tough time of the year. You're not alone. For the many Christians in Fowler, Christmas is a time to celebrate the gift of the Christ child. It is important to remember that the Christmas period is not about the gifts we may or may not receive but, rather, cherishing time with our loved ones whilst reflecting on the year that has passed. I would like to wish all my constituents in Fowler a very Merry Christmas and extend a very Merry Christmas to my fellow parliamentarians as well as their staff and  constituents across the country.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WATTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gellibrand</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:32</span>):  The Albanese government's No. 1 priority is taking pressure off households and helping people in Melbourne's west with the cost of living. Over the last two years we've already delivered tax cuts for every Australian, provided $300 in energy bill relief to every household, revived bulk-billing and saved Australians $1 billion through cheaper medicines. Next year we're committed to going further. A re-elected Labor government will cut student debt by 20 per cent—that's 20 per cent for everyone with a HECS debt, Australia wide. This will be additional cost-of-living relief for the three million Australians who have student debt, including more than 21,000 people in our community in Melbourne's west.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our changes will put $680 a year back in the pocket of the average graduate who has a HECS debt and cut $5,500 off the average debt. Labor wants Australians to earn more and keep more of what they earn and to reduce the debt they owe. These changes don't just help young people who are considering study or those who are currently at university; they help anyone who has a HECS debt, regardless of when they last studied. The impacts are tangible and mean more money in the pockets of more people in Melbourne's west.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will also raise the repayment threshold and lower the rate of repayments, because you shouldn't have to start paying off your student debt until you're earning a decent wage. This plan to slash student debt will work alongside other Labor measures to help make housing affordable for working people. We know that home loan lenders can take student debt into account when determining how much they can borrow, and this can hold people back from buying a home. By reducing existing debt levels and repayments, we're improving the ability of young Australians to save and to break into the housing market. The Albanese government's plan is about pragmatic change to take pressure off households in Melbourne's west and remove barriers to homeownership. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

It's about giving people a fair go. This is what Labor governments do—helping people under pressure while also building Australia's future. The Albanese Labor government is about ensuring that no-one is held back and no-one is left behind, and our student-debt reforms are delivering on this promise.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:35</span>):  I rise today to talk about the impact that the perilous state of the Victorian state Labor government's finances is having on Western Victoria. It is a telltale lesson as to why governments have to be able to manage money, because if they cannot then the sad reality is that it impacts people and it impacts people on the ground. The sad reality, when it comes to this Victorian state Labor government, is that it's impacting those in regional and rural Victoria more than anywhere else—and they have to stop their neglect. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen it play out in road funding. The fact that they've cut road maintenance funding by 95 per cent over the last couple of years is nothing short of a disgrace. The state of the roads is deteriorating before our eyes as a result. But it's not only roads where we're starting to see it; we're also starting to see its impact on our local health services. The figures that came out last week, which show that the pressure on hospitals' budgets continues to grow and that many of our hospitals, including in south-western Victoria, are now running in the red, show how badly this government has mishandled projects and, in particular, mishandled money. It is having a real impact, because when your roads deteriorate and your health network deteriorates it means pain for people, pain for families and pain for what they have to pay, whether it be for getting tyres and rims fixed or in trying to find other ways to get the health care they need. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not only through that that we're seeing it; we're also seeing it in delays when it comes to projects—delays when it comes to fixing roundabouts, delays when it comes to doing community projects which will benefit the community. We're starting to see things like the Twelve Apostles Precinct run year upon year upon year late because this government cannot manage these projects and cannot manage the money around them. From a federal government point of view, we gave over $110 million towards the Twelve Apostles Precinct, and still the action the state government has taken on that has been minimal. They have to get their act in order. </span>

Established in 2011, the college has come ahead in leaps and bounds since their move to the new purpose-built facility in Zillmere in 2017. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased recently to represent Minister for Education Jason Clare at the official opening of Jabiru's new flexible learning and visual art spaces and outdoor learning area, which was delivered thanks to $900,000 in funding from the Albanese Labor government via the Capital Grants Program. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year Minister Clare and I dropped into Jabiru for a visit. Staff and students were able to showcase the school's unique model of secondary education, which focuses on delivering a safe and creative learning community where young people from diverse backgrounds can access a quality education. A lot of work has gone into this project, which has delivered the conversion of ground-floor space to a visual arts studio, a general learning area, withdrawal spaces and a learning commons, as well as a covered outdoor learning area and a kiln shelter. These new facilities will provide school staff, teachers and students at Jabiru with better, more modern spaces in which to work, teach and learn. The Albanese Labor government strongly believes in providing the best possible resources so that local students can realise their potential and develop the skills they need to go on to further study or to find a job.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

David and Frances have worked tirelessly to create a safe, vibrant and caring school community, and I'd like to acknowledge their dedication and service to young north siders and wish them every success for the future.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the same week, I was also able to attend the St Joseph's Nudgee College awards night, the Sandgate District State High School annual awards and the St Patrick's College night of excellence. In addition to celebrating the outstanding achievements of north-side students, we also farewelled the St Patrick's College principal, Mr Chris Mayse, who is retiring after leading the college for the past 10 years. Mr Mayse, thank you for your service to the St Pat's community and for your personal mentoring of me. I wish you very well in your retirement.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, with my remaining time and, I'm sure, with the support of the members for Blair and Freemantle, I would like to send a massive congratulations to the world champions our ParaMatildas. The ParaMatildas secured a historic win at the International Federation of Cerebral Palsy Football, the IFCPF, Women's World Cup. The ParaMatildas are actually our first national football side ever to become world champions, and I'm sure everybody in this chamber sends with me our very best congratulations. Thank you for making us so very happy over the weekend.</span>

At the big end of town, these entities have been causing physical, emotional and financial harm to Australians, and they are running rife under this hapless Labor government. Shoulder to shoulder with thousands of locals, I led the charge against the former Sunshine Coast Council and vested interests when they wanted to build a casino on the Sunshine Coast.</span>

As the former chair of the finance and corporations committee, I chaired an inquiry into the use of credit cards and digital wallets for online gambling, calling on the government to ban their use in online wagering, gaming and gambling services. In short, you shouldn't be able to do online what you can't do in the real world. The member for Clark and I have various opinions on many things, but on this we agreed when we called for action on loot boxes on gaming platforms, which research shows are driving up dangerous gambling behaviours amongst young people and adults alike.</span>

Two in five Australians admit to gambling at least once a week. Concerningly, about one in six Australians aged 16 to 17 participate in under-age gambling—a number which almost triples for those aged 18 to 19. This comes at a cost of $25 billion a year to punters.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:44</span>):  Last Friday, I had the honour of attending the Fremantle Community Legal Centre's white ribbon event at Walyalup Koort in the city of Fremantle to stand against the scourge of men's violence against women and to support its elimination. It's unacceptable for women in Australia and elsewhere that the threat of physical and sexual violence perpetrated by men is never far away. On the flagstones in the entry hall, white crosses stood in rows to mark squares of laminated testimony that carried the stories of murdered women. For all of those crosses, it wasn't a field of pain and loss that stretched back several years; many of the stories were from August, September, October and November 2024.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today is the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. It serves as a reminder that the struggle for women's basic rights remains acute and desperate. It's an opportunity to remember that the work required to eliminate violence against women is an effort that needs all of us all of the time. It's genuinely shocking to think that men's violence contributes to more death, disability and illness in women aged between 15 and 44 in Australia than any other preventable risk factor. On average, one woman is murdered by her partner each week, and for First Nations women in Western Australia alone as many as one in two women has experienced violence and abuse. It's unacceptable, yet virtually every family will have had some experience of this deep societal disease. It's vital therefore that we lift our effort to challenge and change this awful state of affairs in every possible dimension in our culture, in the services that support women who experience violence and in our law enforcement and criminal justice systems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge the staff and leadership of the Fremantle Community Legal Centre for their life-saving work. I'm glad to be a member of a government that recognises the incredible contribution these centres make in the cause of safety, peace and justice for Australian women. In September, the Albanese government announced an investment of $3.9 billion to back those services through the new National Access to Justice Partnership. Ending violence against women and children has rightly been a top of the list priority for the Albanese Labor government. Indeed, we've invested more than $3.4 billion in initiatives to support the National Plan to End Violence Against Women and Children from 2022 to 2032. We've legislated so that, for the first time, workers in Australia have an entitlement to 10 days paid family and domestic violence leave. We've made sure the Housing Australia Future Fund will deliver an additional 4,000 dwellings for women and children fleeing violence, and we've funded the Leaving Violence program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gender based violence is a national crisis that requires attention and action at every level so that women and children in Australia can feel safe everywhere.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:47</span>):  I rise to acknowledge and thank the men and women of New South Wales State Emergency Service. These people are volunteers. They have to go through significant training, and it's particularly relevant that I am speaking about them at a time when we are unfortunately heading again into the bushfire season and storm season. Our SES volunteers are often the first on the spot to assist our firies with bushfires, they rescue people in storms, they are out there in all of the elements, and they are volunteers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to speak particularly about three of the great local SES units I have in my electorate of Hughes. First of all, there is the SES unit at Heathcote. Recently, on 12 October, I attended their women-helping-women workshop day where it was all the women SES volunteers. It was also attended by Debbie Platz, who was then the Acting Deputy Commissioner of Operations for the New South Wales SES. On this day, they were showing local women how to build their resilience to properly prepare their homes and respond to storms and severe weather. Often, we leave it in the hands of our men to go up and clean out the gutters and various things. I know that I certainly do in my household. This was very helpful, particularly for women who might be on their own or whose partner may not be able to climb up ladders and things like that. So it was a very helpful day, and it was nice to see the sisterhood there supporting each other. Inspector Gunnar Hardy, the Unit Commander of Liverpool SES, very kindly came out to my EO on 15 November, just recently, with Chris Hack, the Senior Coordinator for Planning and Community, and showed my staff exactly what the unit is doing to get ready for the bushfire season and the upcoming storm season so that we can best help constituents if they do contact us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last, but certainly not least, I went out to one of Campbelltown SES Unit's training and muster meetings on 22 October 2024 and met with Inspector Nathan McClelland, who's a unit commander, and Michael van Vree, the deputy unit commander, and about 80 very dedicated SES volunteers who are undergoing their training sessions. So I just want to thank all of the men and women in our SES services across our state.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:50</span>):  This week is National Asbestos Awareness Week—a week dedicated to continuing the campaign in raising awareness about the dangers of the use of asbestos and now silica. Asbestos related diseases kill something like 4,000 Australians every year. Around 700 of those are from mesothelioma. Mesothelioma alone costed the health system an estimated $33.7 million in 2021, with the cost of asbestosis estimated at $14 million. Although asbestos was banned more than 20 years ago, the number of cases being diagnosed every year continues to rise and the fact remains that one in three Australian houses, particularly those built between 1950 and 1980, still contains asbestos. Even more concerning is the fact that a number of countries that know full well of the dangers of asbestos continue to use the product. Countries like Indonesia, India, China, Russia, Brazil and others continue to use it each and every day. Across the world, the figures are hard to estimate, but I have seen figures of over 250,000 for the number of people dying from asbestos related diseases.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Silicosis is now the new asbestosis, and it leaves a very similar trail with respect to the number of Australians who are living with and dying from it. At least 579 Australians are living with this illness, and it has already caused the death of many others. Even more concerning, sadly, is that each and every day thousands of other Australian workers are working with the product—sometimes knowingly and sometimes unknowingly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the campaign to raise awareness about the dangers of asbestos and now silica, this Friday, the Asbestos Victims Association of South Australia will be holding a commemorative service, as they have done every year since 2005, at Pitman Park in Salisbury. As part of the service, they lay out on the lawns adjacent to the memorial stone a cross for everyone that we know has died from asbestos in recent years. Every year, the number of crosses continues to rise and now runs into the several hundreds. A similar service will be held by the Asbestos Diseases Society of South Australia on Thursday at the Jack Watkins Memorial Park, at Kilburn, where they will highlight the number of deaths attributed to asbestos and now silica. I again say to people that might be listening to or reading this speech that asbestos is dangerous. If you know of it, follow the guidelines with respect to dealing with it, and I say to governments of all persuasions that we need to continue not only the fight to stop the use of it but also the research into medical cures for it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Years ago, we first arrived at Mount Arapiles with just a tent and the excitement of finally living close to the cliffs we had dreamed of climbing. We set up at the Pines, where we quickly found ourselves embraced by a community of fellow climbers and outdoor enthusiasts. The local town of Natimuk soon became part of that dream, and we transitioned from the Pines to a rental home in Natimuk, bringing not just our passion for climbing, but our professions as a nurse and a counsellor. For many of us, this place is more than just a landmark—it's a part of who we are.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="13050" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ALY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Early Childhood Education and Minister for Youth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:56</span>):  I rise today to congratulate Brother Thomas Oliver Pickett, better known as Brother Olly, on being named the Senior Australian of the Year for Western Australia. As the member for Cowan, I've had the distinct honour of working alongside some of the most exceptional individuals—people whose dedication and passion for our community are nothing short of inspiring. These are individuals who work tirelessly to support the most vulnerable among us, day in and day out, with an unwavering commitment and enthusiasm. They don't do it for recognition and they don't do it for personal gain. They do it because they care. They care for those who can't care for themselves. They care for those in vulnerable situations and, most importantly, they care for the dignity and the respect of others. They do all of this with humility, with selflessness and with a heart full of compassion. Brother Olly Pickett is one of those extraordinary individuals, and this is a well-deserved recognition of the tireless work that he has done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1996, Brother Olly co-founded Wheelchairs for Kids, an organisation committed to providing adjustable wheelchairs and occupational therapy expertise to children in developing countries. Since then, more than—wait for it—61,000 custom-built wheelchairs have been gifted to children across 81 developing countries as well as to remote Australian First Nations communities. All of this has been made possible from right in the heart of Cowan in Wangara, which I'm proud to say is a suburb that will soon be back within the electorate of Cowan next year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What makes Wheelchairs for Kids even more remarkable is its foundation of volunteers. There are more than 250 people volunteering their time in the workshops—and, if anyone has ever visited a Wheelchairs for Kids workshop in Wangara, it is absolutely amazing to see the evolution of one of these wheelchairs that gets shipped over to children in developing countries. There are over 550 other people who volunteer, from local community groups sewing wheelchair covers, crocheting rugs—one of my favourite things—and making soft toys. It's become one of Western Australia's largest volunteer-driven charities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The success of Wheelchairs for Kids is a testament to Brother Olly's philosophy—if you're passionate about something you can make it happen. He's 83 years old, but I've got to tell you: I wish I had his boundless energy, even at my age! His boundless energy and passion continue to inspire hundreds of volunteers who share his vision. Thank you and congratulations, Brother Olly, on this well-deserved accolade.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Productivity is about doing more with less, meeting our needs with fewer working hours and fewer resources. It's not necessarily about consuming more goods; in fact, most of our economy and about 80 per cent of our jobs are now in services. But it is about working smarter, not harder, to improve our standard of living. In the last decade productivity growth has been the slowest in 60 years: about 1.1 per cent per year compared to an average of 1.8 per cent for the 60 years before that. Australia has dropped from sixth in the OECD productivity rankings in 1970 to 16. Some sectors are worse than others. Productivity in the construction sector has actually declined about 12 per cent over the past decade. This is partially driven by restrictive work practices and a lack of investment in innovation. This contributes to our housing problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no sign that productivity will get better without intervention. Last year the government revised down its annual productivity growth assumption from 1.5 per cent to 1.2 per cent, reflecting the slowdown in productivity over the past two decades. This means lower living standards for all Australians and less ability to fund and deliver the services the community expects. We can expect further productivity headwinds, with climate change creating more extreme weather events, geopolitical tensions driving more trade barriers for less-efficient resource allocation and demographic changes driving the need for less productive care services. For a long time, every generation has expected to be a bit better off than the one before, but this is no longer true.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are lots of factors that affect productivity. Much of the industrial world is facing similar challenges. Despite technology changes over the last 15 years seeming pretty radical, they are not translating to greater growth the way railroads and indoor plumbing did. It's harder to achieve productivity growth in services, and, as we get richer and older, services, including care, make up more of our economy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of these factors are outside government control, but we need government to take a long-term perspective and pull all the available levers to ensure productivity growth so that young Australians can look forward with the same optimism as previous generations. With little genuine economic reform for 25 years, we've relied heavily on increased demand and prices for our commodities rather than adding to our economic complexity or focusing on productivity. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are overdue for a broad tax reform discussion to ensure our tax system is fit for purpose for the next generation. Depoliticising tax reform will be key, and we need appropriate and trusted institutions to contribute to this. Luckily, we already have the Productivity Commission, so it's important that we actually listen to and respond to its advice. Government needs to be held to account when it comes to recommendations from independent experts. As taxpayers, we all pay for them, so we should be making the most of their advice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Productivity Commission does a five-yearly productivity inquiry and presented its last report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Advancing </span><span style="font-style:italic;">prosperity</span>, in March last year. This report is 1,000 pages long and provides 29 reform directives. On education, there are recommendations about the use of technology, access to best-practice resources, innovative school models, lifelong learning and student transitions to work. On migration, there are recommendations about better targeting the skilled migration system and reducing qualification barriers faced by skilled migrants. On Workplace Relations, there are recommendations about simplification and modernisation. Technology -related recommendations include internet access, cybersecurity, government data use and better diffusion of new knowledge, especially in the care economy. Business dynamism could be improved through competition tax, trade and regulation reform. Looking to the government's own activities, the report says infrastructure should be subject to cost benefit-analysis, health funding should incentivise innovation, and data and foreign expertise should be used to drive best-practice service delivery. When it comes to decarbonising, climate risks should be disclosed on property sales, adaptation-related infrastructure should be subjected to cost-benefit analysis, the safeguard mechanism should be expanded to cover the whole economy and the integrity of carbon offsets should be improved. These are all worthy recommendations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To show that it's serious about tackling Australia's productivity challenge, I call on the government to publish a formal response to the recommendations in the Productivity Commission report and commit to implementation. Voters are genuinely interested in leaders who take a long-term view, and this is a great opportunity to demonstrate a commitment to looking beyond an election cycle.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr MULINO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:04</span>):  Nobel Prize winner Paul Krugman once said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Productivity isn't everything, but, in the long run, it is almost everything.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This does reflect the fact that we need to focus on productivity growth if we're going to lift living standards in the long run and if we're going to put ourselves in position to deal with some of the first-order challenges that our society faces. To that extent, I agree with some of the underlying sentiments of the motion that has been put before us today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Productivity is absolutely key to our economic agenda and more broadly. As the previous speaker, the member for Curtin, alluded to, productivity is important in many ways. Firstly, multifactor productivity growth is critical to ensure that we get more out of an existing set of inputs. It's also obviously critical to innovation. It's important not just that we get more outputs out of a given set of inputs but that we actually create new outputs and new services. That's why it's so important to look at the context in which this government assumed office after the last election. We came to office after a decade, leading up to 2020, in which productivity growth had been the lowest it had been for over 60 years—1.1 per cent compared to 1.8 per cent over 60 years leading up to 2019 and 2020. Indeed, the trajectory of productivity growth was so bad that productivity growth had fallen for five consecutive years in the lead up to the pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Right from the beginning, this government has seen turning around productivity growth as absolute central. But, as almost all macroeconomists would agree, turning around productivity growth takes time. There's typically a lagged effect between investing in the economy, changing regulation and seeing productivity growth come through in the statistics. We will see that again this time, but this government has invested in a range of important policy reforms that will pay off in important ways.  Indeed, to make reference to the PC reform agenda that the previous speaker alluded to, many of the government's priority areas for reform overlap with those areas identified by the Productivity Commission. So I want to talk on the five pillars that this government has used as a frame for its productivity agenda. I won't have time to run through all of the various components, of course, but these will point to the fact this government is turning productivity growth around and that it is doing so on a very broad basis. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first of those pillars is that we need a more dynamic, competitive and resilient economy, and if I might say—somewhat self-indulgently—the committee chair and I, with the House economics committee, looked at this in great detail. Some of the recommendations that came out of our competition and economic dynamism review are now coming to fruition—reforms of mergers laws, reforms in relation to noncompete clauses. There are others in this chamber who signed up to some of those recommendations. I think those recommendations will have a real impact to strengthen and streamline approval processes and remove 500 nuisance tariffs. There are significant number of reforms already underway being implemented in the parliament at this very time, which will have a significant effect on productivity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a range of reforms right from day 1. Indeed, some of the very first laws passed by the parliament in this term related to the skilled and adaptable workforce, which is the second of the five pillars: university reforms, fee-free TAFE, and a record investment in skills. Many of these reforms are about fairness, but they are also about productivity. There are also number of reforms in relation to the third of the five pillars: harnessing data and the digital economy, expanding the NBN into digital areas, and having a range of digital apprenticeships. That's something that I am seeing in my own electorate. There's investing in the net zero transformation, which is something many in this chamber at this point in time would agree with. That is critical for protecting our environment and society but will also have productivity benefits. Then there's the ageing population and care economy, which is a huge and growing part of our economy. We have put in place a number of reforms through the NDIS and its sustainability through more aged care services at home. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is turning productivity around. It does take some time for it to come through in the official statistics, but it will be reflected in the statistics, because we have reforms right across the economy and our society. This will benefit us in terms of both our quality of life and our economic statistics. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="286042" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SPENDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:10</span>):  Australia prides itself on being the lucky country, the land of the fair go, but since the end of the mining boom, Australia's economic certainty has been less self-assured. We're not making the businesses and innovation that will drive the next golden era of growth. Business investment is down, particularly in non-mining sectors, where it has fallen from nine per cent of GDP to four per cent of GDP over the last 30 years. As a result, Australia has had the worst decade for productivity in the last 60 years and Treasury has downgraded our long-term productivity assumption.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Productivity is the key to growing prosperity and living standards. Over the last 40 years, productivity growth has been responsible for 80 per cent of real wages growth—not to mention that, in a cost-of-living crisis, boosting productivity is the only sustainable way to both lower prices and increase real wages. And people are noticing this gap in productivity. Only eight per cent of the country, according to a recent Redbridge Group poll, believe that the standard of living in Australia will be better for the next generation. This is unprecedented. At the heart of this is our failure to address productivity. We need strong economic reform to drive productivity. While I respect the contribution that the government has made in this term, it is nowhere near enough. When I speak to businesses and I look at the productivity report, there are four key areas: we need reform of the tax system, we need to make it simpler to do business, we need to ramp up innovation and we need to make our tax dollars work better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, on tax: with the last major reform of our tax system introduced in 2000, nearly one in three Australians have never seen a substantial change to the way that tax is collected. In that time, the shape of our economy has transformed and our society has fundamentally shifted. We need reform in the tax system, both to avoid taxes that distort the economy, such as stamp duty, and to create a tax system that incentivises the changes we know we want to make, such as increasing investment in our economy, as well as boosting aspiration and work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, we need to make Australia the best place to start and grow a business. Every government promises to cut red tape but underdelivers. We're adding greater regulation—we're very good at that, in this House, but we are not very good at removing it. I speak to medical researchers who spend a quarter of their time writing grant applications, childcare workers who spend less time with the kids because of their burden of paperwork, and clean energy companies waiting seven years for a windfarm approval.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of this also relates to the industrial relations burden on businesses, and policy setting that has become overly politicised in this country, swinging like a pendulum depending on who is in power. Research conducted by the e61 Institute shows that it has led to perverse outcomes on business decisions, including driving casualisation in the workforce and an increase in capital investment instead of investment in people. In the construction industry alone, productivity has declined by 18 per cent on a per-hours-worked basis since 2012. We need genuine review of workplace settings and an increased threshold at which these laws apply, particularly in terms of the effect on small and young businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, we need to ramp up innovation. Australia is a more challenging place for companies to go from startup to scale-up relative to our peers. On a per capita basis, Australia has half the early-stage investment funding available compared to the UK, and around a third compared to the US. This is despite having the third-largest pension scheme in the world. We've come a long way in this last decade, but data from the Reserve Bank of Australia shows that it is international investors, not domestic, who are doing the heavy lifting. The proportion of early-stage investment made from superannuation has declined from 60 per cent to 30 per cent in the last decade. This has several causes, but, principally, we need to look at: RG 97; Your Future, Your Super; and some of those incentives around early-stage investment, as well as how we make sure that contracts—particularly government contracts—are also open to young, innovative Australian firms, so they can bring the best of world-class innovation to Australia, not just overseas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, government is responsible for around 40 per cent of spending in this country and, frankly, government spending is a major drain on our productivity growth. This has to be an area of greater scrutiny, making our tax dollar work better. I think the place to start, time and time again, is infrastructure spending. We spend billions of dollars a year in this space, but we are losing $30 billion at the current rate on cost overruns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, finally, I urge the Treasurer and the government to come back to us honestly about the Productivity Commission's report on advancing prosperity and tell us which ones they're going to back, because these policy settings are not nice-to-haves. If we do not get this right, the economic opportunities that we took for granted won't be available to our children.</span>

                  <a href="300122" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hawke</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:15</span>):  I share the concerns the member for Curtin raises in this motion regarding productivity growth. But I respectfully disagree with the motion's description of some of the drivers. I think the long-term realisation of productivity growth in our country will come down to a range of complex and interrelational factors that will play out over the long term.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Albanese Labor government came to office, productivity had already been in freefall for a considerable period of time. In the June quarter of 2022, productivity experienced the largest quarterly decline in 45 years—a staggering 2.4 per cent drop. And over the previous decade productivity growth fell to its slowest rate in 60 years, averaging just 1.1 per cent annually. This was of course no accident. It was the direct result of deliberate policy choices by the coalition—choices that suppressed wages, undermined job security and ignored the need for investment in the skills and industries of the future of our economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government believes in a different approach. We understand that investing in workers is not just about fairness; it is also key to lifting productivity and driving sustainable economic growth. When workers are paid fairly, when their jobs are secure and when their workplaces are safe and supportive, they are healthier, happier and more productive. Fair wages and secure jobs reduce turnover, saving businesses the cost of recruitment and training. Workers who have access to paid leave, manageable hours and safe working conditions perform better and innovate more effectively.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By investing in workers, we're investing in the foundations of a strong and resilient economy. The Albanese government's commitment to this principle is reflected in our workplace relations reforms. We're ensuring that all workers have access to minimum standards and that wage growth is not just a hope but a reality for all workers. We're supporting collective bargaining, creating pathways to secure employment and addressing longstanding inequities such as the gender pay gap. Unlike the opposition, who prefer to pit workers against one another in a race to the bottom, the Albanese Labor government are focused on lifting everyone up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Improving productivity is not just about policies for today. It requires a forward-looking strategy that ensures that the workforce is equipped for the challenges and opportunities of the future. That is why our government has made skills and training a cornerstone of our economic agenda. By expanding free TAFE and increasing support for apprentices in critical industries such as construction, aged care and clean energy, we're building a pipeline of skilled workers who will drive growth and innovation. Investing in skills directly addresses one of the most significant barriers to productivity. When businesses cannot find workers who have the right expertise, projects are delayed, costs rise and economic opportunities are lost. By equipping workers with the skills they need to excel in high-demand industries, we're ensuring that businesses can operate at full capacity, take on new challenges and adapt to a rapidly changing local economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By breaking down barriers for women in traditionally male dominated trades we're also expanding the talent pool, ensuring that industries can access the best and brightest minds, regardless of gender. This not only strengthens workforce participation but also fosters diversity, which has been shown to improve problem solving and innovation within teams.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's economic success also depends on creating an environment where businesses can thrive. This includes reducing compliance burdens by abolishing unnecessary tariffs, streamlining environmental approvals and modernising merger regulations. We're also fostering investment in emerging industries where Australia has a natural advantage, such as renewable energy, advanced manufacturing and critical minerals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government understands that better pay and conditions are not just good for workers but also good for our economy. Fair treatment of workers leads to better retention, higher engagement and greater innovation. These are the building blocks of a productive and prosperous society. However, rebuilding productivity after a decade of neglect will take time. It will take more than one term of government to undo the damage caused by those opposite. But we are making progress. Business investment is now above levels seen during the mining boom. And we're creating the conditions for long-term sustainable growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Improving productivity is about shaping an economy where the efforts of workers, businesses and industries are translated into tangible benefits: higher wages, stronger economic growth and better living standards for all Australians. The Albanese Labor government is focused on addressing the structural challenges that have held Australia back for far too long. By targeting the root causes of sluggish productivity and prioritising strategic long-term investments, we are working to ensure that the benefits of a stronger economy are felt by all Australians.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I found a lump in my breast in late 1995 at the age of 25, I went straight to my local bulk-billing GP that morning, and she gave me a referral for a mammogram and ultrasound the following week. I was so grateful to have Medicare to help pay for these tests and to be able to see my GP on the same day I found the lump. I was a casual call centre worker, living in a share house at that time, so I didn't have much money to spare. When the test confirmed the lump as suspicious, I was booked in to see a breast specialist, where she conducted a fine-needle aspiration, and the next day I found out that lump was cancer. The following week, I went to hospital for a lumpectomy and lymph node removal. If I had lived in a country that didn't have universal health care like our Medicare, I'd be in a very bad way financially. The financial burden in some countries without universal health care can cause much worse outcomes too. That is why strengthening Medicare is so important to me and is something I support wholeheartedly for all Australians.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is the party of Medicare. It is in our DNA, and strengthening it is our top priority. At the last federal election, we said that there was no higher priority for Labor in the health portfolio than strengthening Medicare and rebuilding general practice. On the other hand, when the current opposition leader was the health minister, he put a six-year freeze on Medicare rebates, which then prompted the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners to take the extraordinary step of calling on GPs across the country to stop bulk billing in order to maintain the viability of general practice. Again, at the time of the last election, the Hon. Mark Butler said that general practice was in the 'most parlous state in the 40-year history of Medicare'.</span>

                  </a>  I'm terribly sorry. The Hon. Peter Dutton, the now current opposition leader—I think I did call him by his correct title. This is precisely why the Albanese Labor government invested in Medicare by tripling the bulk-billing incentive from 1 November last year in the largest investment in bulk-billing history. In this year's budget, the Albanese Labor government provided $2.8 billion to continue to strengthen Medicare. This is in addition to the historic $6.1 billion investment in Medicare in the 2023-24 budget.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another fantastic investment in health care our government has achieved are the Medicare urgent care clinics. We have opened 77 clinics across Australia and that figure includes 19 of the 29 clinics announced in this year's budgets. These clinics make an enormous difference for patients and ease the pressure on busy hospital emergency departments. They operate fully bulk billed, are open seven days a week, with extended hours and accept walk-in patients—no appointment necessary.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been almost 860,000 visits to these clinics across Australia, and they've all been completely bulk billed. In my electorate of Aston, there have been over 2,400 visits to the one in Bayswater since it began operating as an urgent care clinic in September this year. We know the opposition have never supported these clinics, because they have never supported Medicare. The Hon. Angus Taylor has made it clear that these Medicare Urgent Care Clinics—</span>

                  </a>  Angus Taylor, the shadow Treasurer, has made it clear these Medicare urgent care clinics are on the chopping block, and they will close.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WARE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:25</span>):  I was here for the motion brought by the member for Aston and to hear her speech, which I found quite incredible on a number of levels. I know the member for Aston is a relatively new member, but it's always interesting, unfortunately, when members stand up and simply read out party talking points. It doesn't make for a great speech, particularly when quite a bit of it was disingenuous. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I move, first of all, to the first part of this motion that's been brought by the member for Aston. It says: 'The government is strengthening Medicare and delivering cost-of-living relief to Australians. It includes a record investment in bulk-billing.' That has not occurred in the seat of Hughes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of the 25 practices in my electorate with comparable data between 2019 and 2024—this is coming from the Parliamentary Library; it's not coming from party talking points—only four now continue to be bulk-bill only. That change has been since this Albanese Labor government came in saying, 'There's nothing more important than Medicare.' That change has occurred in the 2½ years since this government has been in. Three of the practices that were previously bulk-billing have moved to mixed billing. This means that, generally, only children and pensioners are bulk-billed. Ten practices have continued to offer mixed billing, three have moved from mixed billing to fees applying for all services, three have remained simply as 'fees applied' and one previously listed as 'other' is now described as mixed billing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have had a massive decline in bulk-billing in the electorate of Hughes, and I have written to the Minister for Health and Aged Care about this. I invite him to come down and meet with these bulk-billing practices, because the GPs in my electorate of Hughes are furious on behalf of their patients. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a shame that the member for Aston hasn't stayed for her own motion. The third part of her motion says that she welcomes the influx of new doctors entering the workforce. Let me tell you what has happened in my electorate at Wattle Grove family practice. It's a family practice located out at Holsworthy, with over 3,000 patients on its books. The minister has now changed the classification of that practice from outer metropolitan to inner metropolitan, which means that this practice has now lost a registrar and cannot get the registrar back. We've gone from four doctors there down to three. That occurred in August, and I started writing to the minister about this. I thank particularly the advocacy of Dr John Stanford, who is the practice manager at Wattle Grove family practice, and also the over 500 people of south-west Sydney that have written to me and signed a petition about this issue. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't think that those 500 people agree that the Albanese Labor government has strengthened Medicare. They certainly haven't invested in Medicare. They have not invested in public health in my electorate, and that is proven. The minister for health has refused to assist to re-classify Wattle Grove family practice so that we can get that additional doctor. So, when I hear that the member for Aston has been able to have an increase in doctors in her electorate, I can't help but ask: is it the case that the health minister assisted the electorate of Aston because Aston is now represented by a Labor member of parliament? If not, why will he not assist the people in my electorate? </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="296272" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MILLER-FROST</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:30</span>):  The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said, to paraphrase, that you only value things you pay for. But I have news for her and for the Liberal Party. Australians value Medicare. They value our health system, they value access to a GP, they value access to hospitals, particularly in an emergency, and they value access to affordable medicines through the PBS. Despite the challenges of our health system, it is without a doubt first class in terms of affordability and access, and definitely in terms of quality. You wouldn't want to be sick anywhere else in the world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is the party of Medicare. It was first introduced through Prime Minister Gough Whitlam's government as Medibank, then abolished by the subsequent Liberal government—as it would seem all Liberal governments do not value the public good of universal health care—then reintroduced as Medicare by the Hawke government. It is a fundamental part of the Australian way of life. It has improved the overall health of the country, has increased our life expectancy and has eliminated medical related bankruptcies. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But that hasn't stopped the Liberals and Nationals trying to undermine it. Who can forget when the now opposition leader, Peter Dutton, was health minister? He tried to introduce a GP copayment; when Labor blocked in the Senate, he froze Medicare rates to try to force GPs to stop bulk-billing. He cut $50 billion from public hospitals and $200 million from emergency departments. He tried to force the introduction of fees to attend a hospital emergency department. He tried to add $5 to every prescription, which would have meant a significant impost on many people who rely on multiple regular medications to manage their health conditions. In comparison, we have cut the price of prescriptions, frozen PBS prices and introduced 60-day prescriptions to further cut the cost to patients—moves he tried to block. He abolished Health Workforce Australia, which the AMA said would undermine capacity to ensure that Australia has the right number of doctors in the right places. Sure enough, that's exactly what happened. No wonder he was voted by doctors as the worst health minister ever. In comparison, we have tripled the bulk-billing incentive, which has resulted in a four per cent increase in bulk-billed consults across South Australia, including in my electorate of Boothby.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's 2024-25 budget provides $2.8 billion to continue to strengthen Medicare on top of the historic $6.1 billion investment in Medicare in the previous year. In 2023, we delivered the biggest indexation boost for Medicare in 30 years. This year, we delivered the second largest increase, with almost $900 million in additional funding for Medicare. This government has delivered more than double the amount of indexation to Medicare than the previous government did in almost a decade. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What a surprise! This has resulted in more junior doctors deciding to become GPs, up by 25 per cent. In the last two years, 17,846 new medical practitioners registered to practise in Australia. That is more than at any time in the last decade under those opposite. It turns out doctors want to work in the interesting and vital area of general practice if they can see it's financially sustainable. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the election commitments I was most pleased about at the last election, having worked in the health sector, was the announcement of 50 Medicare urgent care clinics across Australia, including one in Marion in my electorate. Since then, they have been such a raging success that we've opened 77 Medicare urgent care clinics. The Marion urgent care clinic has been open for just over a year now and has had more than 12,000 patients through its doors. Those are 12,000 people who were too sick or too injured to wait for their normal GP but not bad enough to go to an emergency department, people who instead got seen at the urgent care clinic instead of presenting to the hospital ED.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You would think that this amazing success story making a direct benefit to the health of Australians would be something we could agree on in a bipartisan matter. But no—the shadow Treasurer has made it very clear that, if a Dutton government is elected next year, the urgent care clinics are on the chopping block. They are making a deliberate decision to force Australians to choose between turning up to overcrowded emergency departments, making wait times even worse, and waiting to get an appointment with a GP even if they are injured on the weekend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is the party of Medicare. We know how important this is to the Australian way of life. You can't risk a Dutton led government with the health system led by the man voted worst health minister ever.</span>

I relish the opportunity to highlight the significant ways Medicare is failing rural, regional and remote Australians under the Albanese government. Regional health is in crisis, particularly when it comes to workforce. A lack of workforce means everyday people cannot get the care they need in the right place or at the right time. An independently commissioned report published last year found a $6.55-billion-a-year deficit in healthcare spending for rural Australians. That is $848 per person per year not being spent on health care in the regions compared to the cities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The gap is largely due to rural Australians' lack of access to primary care. It's not because rural people don't need the care; research shows very clearly that rural people live more years with illness or disability and die younger than their metropolitan counterparts. Life expectancy, for example, is highest in Sydney and lowest in outback Northern Territory, with a difference of 13.6 years for men and 12.7 years for women. This is outrageous. The Albanese Labor government should focus on rectifying the inequity in our regional health system, not maintaining their tunnel vision on voters in inner and outer metropolitan Australia and overinflating the success of their current policies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government's tunnel vision is illustrated by changes made to the distribution priority area in 2022. The ill-considered changes quickly resulted in movement of doctors from regional towns like Mildura and Horsham to larger inner regional cities or metropolitan cities. Labor's DPA change made the original health crisis worse, not better. I have called repeatedly for these changes to be reversed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another failing of this Labor government has been the introduction and rollout of urgent care clinics. These clinics are designed to help Labor state governments with overloaded emergency departments and failed primary care clinics. UCC's rob Peter to pay Paul by draining the workforce from private GP clinics to better-paid taxpayer funded positions in UCC's. The differential in pay and conditions between state funded health services and Medicare funded primary care is an ongoing issue in regional health, worsening workforce shortages around the country. The distribution of UCCs also favours Labor held electorates, with coalition held electorates in both cities and rural areas missing out. In fact, 66 per cent of all UCC's are in Labor held seats; who would imagine? UCC's outside the capital cities are highly skewed towards large regional centres such as Labor held Bendigo and Ballarat and of little benefit to people living in the large swathes of our country outside these areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has also hung its hat on the effectiveness of the changes to the rural bulk-billing incentive, yet Labor changes have been described as tinkering around the edges, given they only apply to children under 16 years and those with concession cards. Under Prime Minister Albanese, bulk-billing rates dropped from 88.8 per cent under the coalition in 2021 to 77.4 per cent for the year 2023-24. Hence, these changes have not met their aim of improving access to primary care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said my maiden speech in 2019, a person's postcode should not determine their health status, but, for people in Mallee, it absolutely does. I thank doctors and health professionals in Mallee and in rural areas around the country for their dedication and hard work in providing high-quality health care to their communities. We must support our health workforce to do this often-thankless work by ensuring that regional health is high on the agenda and that Medicare funding for rural people is appropriate to the size and nature of the challenges experienced. Only a coalition government will be focused on the needs of people all over this wonderful country. Thank you.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GARLAND</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:40</span>):  I think the extraordinary attack we just heard on urgent care clinics should give us all pause for thought to recognise that these urgent care clinics are under real risk from the coalition at the next election. I know the people in my community and the people who use the urgent care clinics in Chisholm—we've got one in Mount Waverley—should be quite concerned about what a government led by the worst health minister in Australia's history would do to our community's health. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We said at the election that there was no higher priority for Labor in the health portfolio than strengthening Medicare and rebuilding general practice. I grew up in a household where my parents ran general practices. So, it is so dear to my heart that Australians have access to health care when they need it, regardless of how much money they might have to pay. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our budget from this year provides $2.8 billion to continue to strengthen Medicare. Of course, Medicare is a Labor invention, and we are proud of it. This $2.8 billion that we're going to use to continue to strengthen Medicare is in addition to what was an historic $6.1 billion investment in Medicare in last year's budget. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reforms we're introducing respond to the recommendations of the Strengthening Medicare Taskforce, taking the key steps needed to address the many pressing challenges in our healthcare system and making sure that it is a system that can be sustained for years to come. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government has delivered more than double the amount of indexation to Medicare than the previous government did in almost a decade. What a waste of time that was. We know the financial viability of general practice as we went into the last election was in serious trouble. There was a six-year freeze on Medicare rebates that started when the now Leader of the Opposition was health minister. That is a damning record. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners took the step of calling on every GP in the country to stop bulk-billing to maintain the viability of general practice. What a parlous state our health system was placed in under the now Leader of the Opposition when he was health minister. </span>
              </p>

                  </a>  Absolutely Australia's worst, I hear from my friend, who is a doctor and would know a thing or two about health care. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, strengthening general practice and Medicare is not the only thing our government is doing to protect and enhance the health of Australians. We went into the election promising that we would make medicines cheaper, and we're delivering on that promise. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is quite amazing that people in my electorate have saved over $7 million since we introduced 60-day scripts. This is money back into the pockets of households when they really need that extra money. It's freeing up appointments at general practices right across my community and right across the country. And I know that through our investments in Medicare and the changes we've made to bulk-billing we've had almost 31,000 additional visits to bulk-billing GPs. We know nationally, too, that we've seen a huge boost. In my home state of Victoria, we've had an additional 1.4 million visits to GPs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think we should be concerned, as I said at the start of this contribution, about what would happen to our healthcare system if Australia's worst health minister ever got anywhere near becoming Prime Minister. We know there is an ideological dislike, hatred and loathing for Medicare. We saw that previous Liberal governments axed universal schemes like Medibank. So, there is form here. As they say, the greatest predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour, so we should all be very concerned about what will happen to Medicare and what will happen to our broader healthcare system if those opposite ever get the chance to be in government again. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:44</span>):  It's a great privilege to rise today and speak on this motion that was moved by the member for Aston—and I'll get to some of her contribution shortly. But let's be absolutely clear: this motion is an attack on the Leader of the Opposition and a desperate revival of the 'Mediscare' campaign that we saw in 2016. The coalition has a proud track record in relation to government investment in the health of our nation, including in Medicare, and it's important to use this opportunity to state some of the facts about how the coalition actually run health in Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, what we've seen today is essentially a desperate attempt to resuscitate that disgraced 'Mediscare' campaign. What actually happened when the coalition was in government was that we increased hospital funding from $13.3 billion to $22.7 billion; we had $537 billion in the forward estimates, which included things like a $7.3 billion increase in Medicare and a $10.1 billion increase in aged care; and we added and amended 2,800 PBS medicines. And whilst the Leader of the Opposition was the health minister—which the current Labor government like to refer to quite frequently—one of the key things that he did was start the Medical Research Future Fund to the tune of $20 billion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another fun fact which is frequently overlooked by those opposite is that, whilst the Leader of the Opposition was the health minister, Medicare bulk-billing rates were actually at about 84 per cent. And, as we had confirmed in question time recently, under the previous coalition government bulk-billing rates actually reached 88 per cent. Incredibly—you wouldn't believe this—under the Labor government they are down to 77 per cent. So, whilst Labor talks a big game on managing Medicare and delivering health services, the numbers just don't stack up. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also interesting that they continue to refer to their Medicare urgent care clinics as one of the key planks in how they're increasing bulk-billing services. So I thought I'd use a little local example from the electorate of Fadden. It is in the suburb of Oxenford, which is tucked in neatly next to the M1 and is home to some of our favourite theme parks. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Oxenford you will find a Medicare urgent care clinic. But here's the thing. I remember something from some time ago. In November 2013 a previous Labor government opened the Gold Coast's first GP super clinic at Oxenford—miraculously! It is located at No. 2, Leo Graham Way, Oxenford. Now, that is incredible. You wouldn't think that, 10 years later, to the month, Health Minister Butler, in November 2023, would announce a Medicare urgent care clinic at No. 2 Leo Graham Way, Oxenford. There are striking similarities. They are in the same building. They do the same thing. They provide bulk-billing services with longer hours. What have we got? We have got a GP super clinic that was rebadged as a Medicare urgent care clinic. There has been no increase in patient numbers. This is the same service in the same building, which the health minister is dressing up as a new initiative to deliver on an election commitment. Actually, it is completely misleading the Australian people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has a proud record on health. With this motion, Labor are, typically, trying to search for a corflute slogan for the upcoming election. They should spend less time trying to attack the coalition and more time trying to fix the health system. Australians know the coalition can be trusted on health.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In December this year, next month, Royal Far West will be 100 years old. I can proudly say that its roots are firmly planted in the Parkes electorate. Reverend Drummond, who spent time himself recuperating in Manly all that time ago, thought, 'Wouldn't it be wonderful to bring children from the country to the coast, where they could get medical care and assistance—not only those children but their families as well?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first lot of children that came in from the country came from places like Brewarrina, Bourke and Cobar. One of the first establishments was an old railway carriage that was repurposed for use as a clinic in Cobar. So Royal Far West has a long and proud history in delivering care to children from remote parts of Australia, largely New South Wales, but it has now expanded into other areas. Originally, as children and families were brought in to their facility at Manly, they had an all-encompassing, all-round service that focused on not only the needs of the child but how the family could assist as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, with the growing need and the changes in technology, Royal Far West has now expanded, providing services over a much larger area to a larger number of schools. In 2019, Royal Far West was funded under the previous government, under Minister Hunt—the regional health minister—to expand their services under telecare. We are now seeing a significant number of children. Indeed, last year they supported 21,000 country children. While telecare and technology is not a complete replacement, it's certainly enabling them to reach a larger number of people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've actually sat in on some of the lessons. A great example of this is Narromine Public School, in my electorate, which has been doing this now for 10 years. There is a coordinator in the school. There is an occupational therapist, a speech therapist or whoever working on screen. What the therapist has is replicated in the school. We've seen, after the initial assessments done of the child, significant contribution. As we know—and my good friend and colleague opposite the member for Macarthur would know—the sooner an intervention can happen with a child the better chance we've got to get them on the straight and narrow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a concern, though, that the funding runs out next year, and I met with Royal Far West last week. They are concerned, because they are caught up in the electoral cycle as well. We've got an election coming up. There's uncertainty around that. Will there be a budget? Will there not be a budget? All of those things are concerning them. Now that they've got this up and running, if they had this funding cut, they would have to see a reduction of about 50 per cent in the number of students that they support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly, the purpose for me for bringing this motion to the House is not only to provide to the members and the House itself the importance of the Far West but also to highlight to the government of the day—and also the opposition as well if there's a change of government—the need for certainty around this funding for the Royal Far West. It does a wonderful job. It gets a lot of children in a practical and meaningful way and is making a huge change to what they're doing. Twenty per cent of the children who are under these programs are Indigenous and 50 per cent are under eight years old. That's exactly the time when this intervention wants to be. I recommend the motion to the House and strongly urge the government to look at the funding ongoing.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:55</span>):  I first of all thank the member for Parkes for bringing this motion. I also add that I'm very sad to see him leaving parliament at the end of this term. He's been a great addition to the parliament—in particular, his interest in rural and regional health has been really important, and I thank him for his service. On the health committee he's been a great asset, so I thank him for that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the Royal Far West very, very well. In fact, when I was a senior registrar at the children's hospital many, many years ago, my wife and I used to take kids who were staying at the Royal Far West out for day outings et cetera around Sydney. I remember one boy, Peter, a lovely, lovely kid with very unstable diabetes. People were frightened to take him away from health care, so my wife and I took him to lots of different places. We took him to the Easter show. We took him to Bondi Beach and all around the place. He was from Broken Hill and was staying in the Far West so that he could be treated at the children's hospital, then at Camperdown, for his diabetes, which, as I said, was quite unstable. He stayed there for many weeks at a time. He used to come every year. He came from a family at Broken Hill who struggled with his health care, and I think the Royal Far West really made a difference to his health care and the management of his diabetes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had another boy—quite a funny little boy—from Lismore, I remember, called Shane. Shane had something called Ondine's curse, which is a very rare condition: when he went to sleep, he'd stop breathing. It sounds quite odd, but that's what he had. He stayed at Far West quite a lot whilst his ventilator was being stabilised before he went back to Lismore. We took him out several times. We also took him to the Easter show.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another girl, called Melissa, had seizure disorder. I think she came from Dunedoo. She was at the Royal Far West while her epilepsy was being stabilised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The paediatrician at Manly, my old friend Alan Oldfield, who's no longer with us, used to help manage these kids in cooperation with their GP or paediatrician where they came from whilst they stayed in the Royal Far West. It was a great, great service. Clearly, the needs have changed a lot in the last 40 years since we cared for these kids. The government has provided significant funding for mental health support, particularly following the floods and bushfires that have beset our country in the last decade, particularly for support in communities for kids with developmental problems. As the member for Parkes had commented, once these kids are picked up—and, hopefully, picked up early—intervention makes a huge difference not only to their lives but to their families as well. The Royal Far West has been integral in that, trying to replicate services for kids from the bush compared to kids who lived in the inner cities and close to the major children's hospitals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's provided $20 million through the Royal Far West for the Community Health and Hospitals Program. We've provided telehealth services. I agree with the member for Parkes that it is important that this funding is committed to over the longer term so that ongoing services can be provided for those kids. We're very, very lucky to have a service like the Royal Far West system, and I, for one, will commit to getting the government to continue supporting Royal Far West in their expanded role to those communities that have been really severely affected by the natural disasters which, in this era of climate change, are not going to stop. They're going to continue. It is very important that Royal Far West continues in its fantastic work throughout our rural and regional communities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know, wherever we are in Australia, that the mental health system is facing huge challenges. Our government is committed to making sure we have fit-for-purpose and best-for-purpose services throughout the country, not just in the inner cities. Mental health reform was part of our last federal budget, and it will continue to be the focus of our future budget in 2025. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are very lucky to have a service like Royal Far West. I enjoyed very much the time I spent learning from them about how best to provide services to kids in our rural and regional areas. Long may it continue. I thank the member for Parkes for bringing this motion, and I commit to supporting it.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHESTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gippsland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:00</span>):  Like the member for Macarthur, I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the member for Parkes for bringing forward this very important motion but also acknowledge that he has announced his retirement. He gave a valedictory speech last week. Smalltown Australia does need big, strong, sensible voices, and the member for Parkes has been one throughout his career. It's also fitting that the member for Macarthur mentioned Broken Hill in his contribution, because not so long ago I was at a function with the member for Riverina, and he told the member for Parkes, 'Do you know, if Broken Hill was in my electorate, they'd just call it the Hill, because I would have fixed it by now!' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All dad jokes aside, the member for Parkes has served with great distinction in this place. He's been a friend and a trusted colleague, whose passion for rural and regional Australia knows no bounds. He has always been someone focused on practical and sensible outcomes. That's why this motion today fits very nicely with his entire mode of operation throughout his political career. At its heart, this motion is about helping young people achieve their full potential but also publicly acknowledging an organisation that has done more than just talk about the problem. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Royal Far West has been out there for 100 years now, making a difference in our rural and regional communities. Royal Far West has had 100 years of service to Australians. It has been able to overcome the tyranny of distance to provide those early intervention services which have made it easier for young people in our rural and regional communities to access services and to achieve their full potential. It's also particularly important to acknowledge, as the member for Parkes did, that it has helped to reduce the cost of living for families in those rural and remote communities, who are able to access services and facilities without always having to travel to metropolitan areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Royal Far West has demonstrated a capacity and capability, which is why it's so important that this government—and any future government—continues to invest in solutions that have been proven to work on the ground in rural and regional areas. There is an opportunity, particularly for us in our rural and remote communities, to provide services using technology in locations where we can't always attract the skilled specialist health staff we need. Nothing is better than having a skilled health provider treating people in our communities or going around schools and meeting young people, but if that's not available to us then we should be using technology in the same way that Royal Far West has been using technology through its National Paediatric Telecare Service. This is a great example of a local solution to a local problem which is being financed by the Commonwealth and which is really making a difference on the ground in rural and remote communities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would make one other point, and it's a shout-out to any young health professionals thinking about careers in rural and regional communities. Don't believe everything you read in the newspapers. Get out there and have a look and see what you can experience and the career fast track that exists in our rural and regional communities. You will get exposure to a whole range of issues, ailments and conditions that will fast-track your career. It's a great experience. Anyone in the health sector looking at a rural experience should consider moving to a rural and remote community and offering their services to communities that perhaps don't normally have access to those skilled health professionals. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It makes sense to invest in the continuation of the National Paediatric Telecare Service. As the member for Parkes indicated, early intervention has very clear benefits for the young person, their social achievements and their own personal achievements in life. But there are also economic benefits for the government. The savings that ensue from early intervention and the prevention of some longer-term issues are clearly evident in the reductions in costs for the government down the track. It is well known that Royal Far West provides outstanding services. It's also well known that in our rural and remote communities our children's health, education and wellbeing have some additional barriers. And the whole point of what Royal Far West has been doing, and what the member for Parkes has done throughout his entire parliamentary career, is to try to help young people in our communities achieve their full potential by improving access to services for them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The final point I would make is in relation to the ongoing funding model. The reason the member for Parkes has moved this motion is that the provision of certainty through the continuity of funding gives an organisation like Royal Far West the confidence to employ a workforce and have ongoing employment opportunities. When funding runs out on short-term contracts the workforce has to start looking around for a new job probably six to eight months before the contract even runs out, and they sometimes leave prematurely. So having that certainty and continuity will give confidence to Royal Far West and their workforce to continue to make a huge difference throughout rural and regional Australia, and I commend the member for Parkes for his motion. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DAVID SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bean</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:05</span>):  I'd also like to commend the member for Parkes for bringing this motion before the House. Royal Far West is a charity dedicated to improving the health and wellbeing of country children and has been doing so since 1924—almost a hundred years. Their work addresses service gaps and supports our most vulnerable families and communities to help students meet learning, wellbeing and engagement outcomes through unique, multidisciplinary and child-centred approaches that partner with families, schools and communities to provide truly integrated and collaborative wraparound care. RFW provides multidisciplinary allied health screening, assessment and therapy services for children up to 12 years old. It also provides capacity building services for parents, carers, teachers and local health professionals. And while the RFW traditionally operates from a hub in Manly, New South Wales, using telecare and working with local communities, RFW's services extend to rural and remote areas right across Australia. I note that, while RFW does not operate in or service the ACT or my electorate of Bean, it plays an important role across the region. And as a member of this national parliament I, and I believe all of us in this parliament, have an interest in appropriate and cost-effective services being delivered for all citizens across all parts of the nation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At this point I note and acknowledge the correspondence my office has received about this matter from the Catholic Education Office, Archdiocese of Canberra and Goulburn. The Catholic Education Office have communicated to me the important work done in remote communities like Lake Cargelligo and the critical difference they're making to some of our local First Nations communities. These representations have aided my understanding of the works that RFW does in the capital region and the issues around its future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm advised that since the COVID-19 pandemic RFW has shifted its footprint to delivering approximately 40 per cent of its clinical and service staff and services in communities across the four states. In 2023, they supported over 21,000 country children, parents and educators, of whom 30 per cent identified as First Nations Australians. Over the last seven years, since 2018-19, the Community Health and Hospitals Program provided RFW $19.7 million to expand their service and upgrade necessary infrastructure. This funding runs to 30 June 2025. The government also provided RFW with just over $300,000 in 2023 under an October 2022 budget allocation to support community sector organisations to manage the cost of staff wages and higher inflation. In addition to the CHHP, RFW received community recovery program and bushfire recovery program funding across six separate state and Commonwealth grants. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The mental health and wellbeing of all Australians is a priority for the Australian government, including for children and their families affected by disasters. I recognise the important work of Royal Far West, particularly their work supporting young people through periods of national disaster and recovery, and the pressure this places on their funding sources. The National Disaster Mental Health and Wellbeing Framework was released in 2023. The framework was developed in consultation with, and agreed by, state and territory governments. The framework aims to guide how governments and recovery partners consistently and sustainably support the delivery of mental health services and improve the wellbeing of affected individuals before, during and after disasters. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Department of Health and Aged Care is working closely with the National Emergency Management Agency to implement the framework. Under the framework, states and territories have the lead role in emergency planning and coordination. The government recognises the importance of locally led and delivered responses and that states and territories are best placed to identify the type and level of assistance to make available following a natural disaster.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's critical that organisations like Royal Far West are not forgotten in this work. At the national level, organisations like these can fall through the cracks despite the critical work they're doing. So I support the government continuing to work closely with Royal Far West, and we will, of course, engage in further discussions about their future and support further funding for RFW.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="219646" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:10</span>):  At the outset, I wish to heartily commend the member for Parkes for bringing forward this very important motion. Certainly, for a regional member—somebody who represents half of the landmass of New South Wales—health is critical. If you have a healthy electorate, you have a happy electorate. No-one knows this better than the member for Parkes, who has championed the cause of Royal Far West for as long as he has been in this place, since 2007, and, indeed, even long before that, when he was in local government and when he was just a concerned member of his country community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year, we celebrate 100 years of Royal Far West. I well recall when, on Monday 17 December 2018, as Deputy Prime Minister, I attended the opening of the Centre for Country Kids, the state-of-the-art facility that Royal Far West opened at Manly. I was there with: Gladys Berejiklian, the then New South Wales premier; the then New South Wales governor, David Hurley; and many, many others. Most importantly, whilst they were august, distinguished and honoured guests, it was the kids who we were there for—it was the kids who were the most vital guests at that particular function.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I said at the time—and I don't usually quote myself, but this is just for the record:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">For generations, Royal Far West at Manly has held a special place in the hearts of country families when it comes to making sure distance is no barrier to accessing integrated health, education and mental support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The expansion of this wonderful facility means Royal Far West can support even more country children and their families and provide the support, respite and care they need. Children in the regions are the future of our communities—The Liberals and Nationals Government is proud its investment supports Royal Far West to ensure country children access the same services their city counterparts and are given every opportunity to thrive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what Royal Far West is about. That's what that $10 million investment was all about. I don't think it matters what side of the House you are on. This is important. This is proper. This is right. When you see that 190,000 children in rural and remote Australia have health and developmental needs that are not being met, you understand, you appreciate, just how important Royal Far West is. They support, as we've heard, children's developmental, mental and behavioural health so they can reach their full potential.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All politics is local. I know that, even in my own sprawling electorate—it is not quite as large as that of the member for Parkes, I appreciate—14 schools have 120 students benefitting from the services that Royal Far West provides each week. Of the Royal Far West services, it's really important to note that 93 per cent of educators were very satisfied with the service, 87 per cent of children achieved or exceeded the goals they had been set, 97 per cent of educators said they were more confident supporting the children they work with and 94 per cent said they would want to receive services in the future. They're telling statistics and they do tell a story of how vital this service is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the member for Parkes and others have spoken too, in this debate, about how ongoing funding is essential—is crucial—because it will provide certainty for staff. When you get staff in remote areas, they do need that certainty. They want to have a reason to stay in that community, to provide for the children who most need the services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the beginning of the National Paediatric Telecare Service funding in 2020, the service has supported more than 30,000 beneficiaries, expanded into four states—New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia—and partnered with a 152 schools and 64 early learning centres. It's something that sits at the heart of what Royal Far West does. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We support it. We want it to continue. We want it to expand. If you look, for example, at Royal Far West's innovative pilot program Better Learning Better Lives, which ran in five rural and remote schools—Trundle Central School; Rainbow P-12 College; Our Lady of Sacred Heart, Springsure; Clermont State School; and Middleton Public School—some 560 children benefited from the project.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the results are there. The service is there. We just have to have the political will to make it happen. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:15</span>):  I too commend the member for Parkes for bringing this motion forward. The health and wellbeing of those in rural and remote communities is absolutely paramount. In particular, we need to make sure that people can get the services they need when they need them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to make a comment on what the member for Gippsland was saying before he left the Federation Chamber—that students should really consider a career, particularly in a medical field, in regional, rural or remote communities. I've practised in hospitals in those settings, and you see a wide range of presentations. You become operationally and clinically independent. You also provide lifesaving and preventive care for people in communities in which health care can be quite scarce. So I want to agree with the member for Gippsland that people should definitely consider a career in regional, rural or remote healthcare settings. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Royal Far West is a charity that is dedicated to improving the health and wellbeing of country children. It was established long ago, in 1924. It provides multidisciplinary allied health screening and assessment and therapy for children up to 12 years old. The early screening and detection of pathology in younger years is so important. If it is not identified and treated, it can have huge ramifications for people as they enter their adolescence and their adult life. And it can not only have an impact on their health; it can also have an impact on their ability to study or enter the workforce, on their social interactions with other people and on how they interact in the community. So it's so important that we nip these issues in the bud early on so that they aren't exacerbated and become a significant problem into the future. That's what Royal Far West does. And it's not only in the allied health space. As the member for Riverina also pointed out, it provides capacity-building services for parents and carers, for teachers and for local health professionals. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Traditionally Royal Far West has operated from a hub in New South Wales, in Manly, but, by using telecare, its services have extended into rural areas, in New South Wales, Queensland, WA and also Victoria. We have found that, since the COVID-19 pandemic, Royal Far West has shifted its footprint from its Sydney base. Approximately 40 per cent of clinical and service staff now work in communities across the four states it services, which I think is fantastic. That's a great thing. Providing telecare and telehealth services is one thing, and there are benefits from doing that, but having people in place, in situ, where they can provide that assistance on the ground to people is something that we need. As I said, whether it's allied health, teachers, parents and carers or support staff, it's vitally important for children in these regional, rural and remote communities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2023 Royal Far West supported over 21,000 country children, parents and educators, of whom 30 per cent identified as First Nations Australians. That's also an important thing to note. We know that our First Nations communities right across the country suffer from significantly worse health and social outcomes—I don't need to tell this chamber about that; a lot of our communities know that—so the support that Royal Far West is providing to these communities is absolutely necessary. We know that they also commenced telecare services in 2014 and $19.7 million over seven years has been provided through the Community Health and Hospitals Program in 2018 and 2019 to expand this service and upgrade necessary infrastructure. This funding run through to 30 June 2025.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has also provided Royal Far West with just on $350,000 in 2023 under the October 2022 budget—an allocation to support community sector organisations to manage the cost of staff wages and higher inflation as well. In addition to this Community Health and Hospitals Program, there has also been some community recovery program and bushfire recovery program support across Commonwealth grants.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion this morning is about the House acknowledging that the Albanese government is making sure that Australians can continue to pay with cash for essential items if they want to while also ensuring an orderly transition to the phasing out of cheques. Note that the government's plan will mandate that businesses must accept cash when selling essential items, with appropriate exemptions for small businesses, and ensure that cash can be used for essential purchases such as groceries and fuel so that those who rely on cash will not be left behind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Lalor, I welcome our action on this. We're acting because of what we know. We know that around 1.5 million adult Australians rely on cash to make more than 80 per cent of in-person payments. We also know the number of businesses refusing to accept cash is growing as cash use in Australia declines. Some of that decline is incremental; RBA data from 2022 shows that up to 94 per cent of businesses reported accepting cash for payments, and that's a decline from 99 per cent of businesses just prior to the COVID pandemic. That feels like a small number, but it translates into millions of Australians feeling that, given our economy and the way we use money, they're being left behind in the process. The RBA data also shows that around half of Australia's businesses plan to move away from cash payments in the near future. All of this means that we as members of parliament can all see that this is going to make some Australians very nervous, particularly where they are accustomed to using cash and they have faith in a system that they've known.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the demography here is that older Australians are those more likely to be concerned about this and less likely to have moved into non-cash arrangements in their personal lives. In my electorate there are 17,000 pensioners, if you look at those in that older category, and I believe that they deserve the right to depend on cash. The Albanese Labor government will ensure that no-one is left to fall through the cracks, implementing action to ensure that people can use cash for their purchases, particularly for essential purposes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know there's a place to cash in our society, and we can't deny older Australians this right. The announcement has been well received by both community groups and businesses as well as by individuals who simply prefer using cash in their transactions. Whether it's at the supermarket checkout or the local petrol station, when it comes down to the essentials, Australians will have the comfort of knowing they can pay in cash. This is incredibly important. We're doing this work to ensure that, for people in low-income or disadvantaged communities, who often face barriers to accessing digital banking, cash is available for them and available for use. This also allows those without smartphones or reliable internet access or bank accounts to purchase essentials.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If a storm hits, if we cut the power off, if the power gets cut off, if a bushfire breaks out, if we have to force families to evacuate or if telecommunication lines fail, it can leave people without access to banks. Part of this is how we ensure that those people can still access the essentials they need. We know that in recent years there have been two ways we can do this. In some instances, cash becomes primary; in other instances we actually need the capacity for government to pay into people's accounts electronically to ensure that they can do these things. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a world where we're potentially in transition, I think it's critical that we continue to ensure that members of our community can conduct their business in cash. Currently, there's not a legal requirement for businesses to do that. We're going to work through a consultation process, get the settings right and bring this before the House as soon as is practical to ensure that businesses have clarity about the future but also that we're looking after those people in our communities who want to use cash for their essentials. They deserve to be able to use cash for their essentials and should be able to rely on a government to make sure that's possible in the future. </span>

                  <a href="279991" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONAGHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:25</span>):  I'm pleased to rise on this motion about retaining cash. I thank the member for Lalor for moving it because I think it's very important. The member made a very good point in her speech: the people who are most concerned about this are older Australians. They have grown up dealing with cash. It's been easy and reliable. What is not easy and reliable for many of them is technology. They don't have the iPhone that they tap on and they're not necessarily across the internet or on NetBank or some other application. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I get emails on this every single day. When I walk through the streets or, as I was on the weekend, at the Dorrigo Show, people raise this issue saying, 'Pat, we've got to make sure that we keep cash.' It's that fear factor for older Australians. Over 30 per cent of my electorate are over the age of 65. It is time we had that conversation and that we legislate that cash must be able to be used for essential items. I understand why you can't use cash to go and buy a brand-new Mercedes—because the first thing you think about is organised crime—but for essential items there's a very good reason behind using it. I'll give you three examples. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, I went to Coles recently and there had been a blackout. In that shopping centre, they have two ATMs. The ATMs didn't work because there was no electricity. The Coles scanners didn't work and there was a sign out the front saying, 'We accept cash only.' I didn't have any cash on me, so I got back in the car and went home. These things are going to happen; you're going to have weather events. In the horrible floods that we saw, everything went down and general supermarkets were saying, 'We only accept cash,' but you couldn't get the cash out. You couldn't use cash unless you had some at home. You have to have a backup plan. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am really concerned about the banks. I say it all the time—I don't mean the people who work in the banks; I'm talking about the banking infrastructure or corporation itself—they are not our friends. I wish they'd stop trying to pretend they are our friends. They are money-making corporations and they will do what is necessary to increase their fees for their shareholders. Good on you, if you've got bank shareholdings in a self-managed super fund—that's great. But we need to look after the little people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A recent example is of a pensioner in my electorate who went in with $160 in cash and wanted to deposit it over the counter. They wouldn't take it because of anti-money laundering legislation. This is a little old lady. She didn't look like me, with a handlebar moustache: a Chopper Read lookalike for Movember. They wouldn't take it, yet they said to her, 'There's a machine out the front that you put your cash in and put your card in, and that'll transfer it into your bank account.' She didn't know how. I made the point that these people behind the counters might find that they're going to lose their jobs because of automation. What that person should have done was get up, walk around the counter and say, 'Here you go; I'll show you how to do it.' The concept that we are going to lose cash in the future is beyond the pale. We have to ensure that we have cash in our society, as a backup, for essential services only, and to ensure that our older Australians are able to rely on that system that they have known for many, many years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll make the final point in relation to anti-money-laundering. The concept that drug dealers and crime agencies deal only in cash is of the past. They're dealing in cryptocurrency now. So, the argument that we've got to get rid of cash to stop this is a falsehood. We have to look after our Australian citizens.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:30</span>):  I'm really pleased to be able to speak on this motion regarding the use of cash, because one of the things that I heard very loudly and clearly from the residents of Five Dock when I doorknocked them about a year ago was how disappointed they were that the Commonwealth Bank branch in Five Dock had been closed. They were disappointed that they weren't going to be able to get their banking services and weren't going to be able to get access to cash through ATMs, and there was real concern in the community. At the time, I wrote to the Commonwealth Bank and conveyed the concerns of the residents. Unfortunately, the bank said they would not be reinstating the branch but that many of the services were going to be available through Australia Post. I think this is part of steps the Commonwealth Bank is taking to close down some of these branches, which I think is really disappointing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things they failed to do, however, was to provide an ATM in the local community that could service people who need to get access to cash. After much campaigning from the local community, we recently were able to get an ATM reinstated in Five Dock. I thought at the time that it was going to be well received, but I didn't realise how well received. Again, I went gone doorknocking in Five Dock, and I happened to doorknock the friendliest street in Five Dock. All the residents were out on Tony's porch on the day that I went, chatting to each other. One of the things raised was the fact that an ATM had been reinstated in Five Dock. Tony, who is in his late 80s, was particularly keen, because he had become reliant on his wonderful neighbour, Jayten, in his 30s, to help him with online banking and was having to do much of the payments online. But what Tony really wanted to be able to do was access cash. So, I was really happy to meet with these residents and celebrate the reinstatement of the ATM in Five Dock.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that small story about the residents of Five Dock indicates how important cash is for many people in our community. Whilst of course we are moving to more digital payments and online purchasing, for many in the community cash is still critical for their purchases of essential items. So I'm very pleased that the government has now said that they will be mandating cash for essential items while making sure there are appropriate exemptions for small businesses. It is key that people like Tony and his mates in Five Dock can still purchase things with cash, especially essential items. And as we move towards more online and digital payment systems, one of the things that is really important is to ensure that there is a mechanism for people to pay for things without it attracting a fee. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm really pleased to be able to join my colleague Jerome Laxale, the member for Bennelong, in pushing a campaign to ensure that there is some form of payment—digital and online—that does not attract a fee. We're not talking about a couple of cents on your coffee in the morning; we are talking about extra dollars when you go to pay for your car registration or to buy a laptop for the kids. It adds up. These fees add up. There has to be some form of payment that does not attract a fee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased that the RBA is doing an inquiry into these payments to see whether or not there needs to be a fee-free, digital and online payment, and I know that the government has said that if the RBA are willing to go down this path, we would also be supporting that with legislation. This is important reform that is happening, because we need to be able to pay for things without there being a fee or being really hard to do so by paying for it with cash. Added to that, there is some reform that's happening within the New South Wales government to ensure that renters who have to pay their rent through an online mechanism are also not forced to pay an additional fee on top of that. This is a really sensible step. It's about ensuring that cash remains in our economy and that there are better and easier forms of payment.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:36</span>):  Let me acknowledge the presence in the chamber of the erstwhile member for Kennedy, who is about to deliver his 977th speech to this parliament—on this occasion about the importance of cash—and acknowledge his 50 years of parliamentary service, including since 1993 as the member for Kennedy. I'd like to thank him for what he has done not just for the people of Kennedy but, indeed, for this nation. Thank you, Bob.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation, this bill, this debate, this motion, is important, because people should be able to pay for things with cash. For many people, whatever legislation we put before the House, as far as finance and treasury laws et cetera are concerned, cash will always be king. It's of great concern to regional communities that we have so many regional bank closures. We need branches to stay open. We need to have the ability to be able to use cash. I'm sure the member for Kennedy agrees with that premise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had a woman in my electorate write to me the other day, concerned about the phasing out of cheques, because people like to hang onto traditional norms of payment. A little known fact is that you can go to the supermarket and pay for your groceries with stamps should that be your desire. They are legal tender, but you could imagine the looks you would get if you tried that on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard earlier from the member for Cowper about the woman in his electorate, who just wanted to cash in $160 worth of cash, to be able to get that back, and the difficulty she had doing just that. Businesspeople these days have had a number of bank closures, particularly in a community such as Junee, in my electorate, which is 42 kilometres from Wagga Wagga, as have Coolamon, Cootamundra, Cowra, Forbes, Grenfell, Lockhart, Parkes, Temora, Wagga Wagga and West Wyalong. It sounds like a line out of the song 'I've Been Everywhere'. Unfortunately it's, 'I've seen banking closures everywhere, man'. It does have an impact on businesses that accept cash. All businesses should accept cash. It's just not right that businesses in Australia do not. I appreciate that some businesses have got their own systems, but they should all accept cash.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I appreciated that the Senate inquiry into bank closures in regional Australia held a hearing at Junee on 21 September 2023. Junee has suffered from several bank closures in recent years, including having four banks once upon a time and probably even more, way back in the day. But three of those four banks, in more modern times, have now closed. Only the Commonwealth Bank remains. It was important for the inquiry to hear the concerns of local residents, particularly the then-mayor, Neil Smith. I know the current mayor, Bob Callow, shares the same concerns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Commonwealth Bank, at least, has put its plan to close the branch on hold and committed to maintaining all of its regional branches in Australia until the end of 2026. I say that's good and not before time. Many of these banks have done very nicely, thank you very much, out of country people—particularly out of our farmers, who've had big holdings. The banks have had the ability to use that money on the international monetary exchange and have been able to lend to customers and do all their banking services on the back of regional Australia providing the confidence and investment in those banks. Then, when the foot traffic suddenly isn't what it used to be, all of a sudden the banks say: 'Well, hang on a minute. Why do we need to keep that branch open?' Well, not everybody has an iPhone, believe it or not. Not everybody wants to do their banking on an iPhone, on a laptop, on an iPad or on a computer. Some people like to use cash. Some people like to go into bank branches. And it's incumbent upon these bank branches, which have done very nicely—thank you very much—out of regional Australia, to keep those branches open.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased that that Senate inquiry heard the evidence. I'm pleased that the Commonwealth Bank has got a stay of execution on some of their bank closures. I would urge and encourage banks to remain open in country Australia. I would urge and encourage the government to do everything it can to make sure that Australians can continue to pay with cash for essential items if they want to, as this motion says, while also ensuring an orderly transition to phase out cheques. Well, hang on a minute. We still need cheques in Australia. It's important. That's one part of this item that I do not agree with. Cash does need to remain in service for as long as we care to think about it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DZY" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:41</span>):  I rise to speak in support of this motion. It is a very important motion and has been a long time coming. We just heard the member for Riverina and previously the good member for northern Queensland talk about the importance of cash. It is important. Many people still use cash. Many of us are fine. We are fairly IT savvy and can do things quite easily on the computer, transfer money and pay bills et cetera, but the majority of Australians, especially the elderly and pensioners, still rely on cash. It is important that we have cash within our society, and it's important that people have access to cash to be able to go in and pay cash, as is their right, if they feel like it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think banks, for a number of years now, have been continuously making it harder and harder to either access cash, accept cash or pay with cash. They do so because it means less staff counting money and being tellers in branches, which therefore reduces their costs. If you have a look at the profits they make, we all know that they make billions and billions of dollars. Rightly so. They are businesses; they've got shareholders. But, at the same time, they have a responsibility to our society, they have a responsibility to our pensioners and they have a responsibility to people who perhaps, for whatever reason, don't have a smart phone or just want the right to pay in cash.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen branches close. We've seen ATMs pulled out of walls, making them harder to find. My own bank, where I live, has closed three branches in the last 18 months. I'm finding it harder, when I actually have to go in to physically do something, to find a branch to go in and talk to. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other day, I decided to go to the head office in King William Street in Adelaide, because I thought surely someone there would be able to assist with this issue that I had. I was told they couldn't, because they didn't have any tellers—just desks and service officers. It gives you an example of where banks are trying to take us and what the public wants.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, I was contacted by a constituent of mine, Mary, whom I wrote to the Treasurer on behalf of to tell him about the importance of cash. I'm pleased that he has listened and is going down this track. Mary, who has a Bakers Delight in one of the biggest shopping centres in South Australia, informed me she deals with a lot of cash; people come in and buy a coffee and a sandwich, and a lot of pensioners use her coffee shop. Recently, she went to the bank to deposit the takings of the day and to take out the cash flow for the next day and was told she could not have any cash flow, because they have stopped that service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She then had to ask around at the other banks within the same shopping centre, who all said: 'Yes, we'll give you cash, but you're not a client of this particular bank. You have to sign up with us.' You can imagine the rigmarole that would go with taking all her mortgages, all her payments and everything to a new bank. She then went back to her branch in the shopping centre and was informed there was a particular branch of the same bank seven kilometres away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She now has to make that trip seven kilometres every day, back and forth, to access cash that she needs. It's not a luxury; it is vital to her business to be able to give out change. She was recently informed that that service stopped at well at this other shopping centre that she travels to, so she is now looking around to see where else she can access cash for her business, for the people that pay cash and need change. You can see how important it is. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Coincidentally, this morning, one of my staffers took his son and a friend of that son to a concert at the entertainment centre. They went to line up to get food during the concert and were told that only cards would be accepted—not cash. This kid was lucky that he was with a family friend who paid for it, and then they gave him the money. This was a young kid who turned up with cash from his parents to buy something to eat at this concert and was told, 'We can't accept it.' That's not on. We need to ensure that cash is available and remains as part of our society, and people should have a choice. We all have a choice. If you want to do it electronically, you can; if you want to pay cash, you can. Sure, doing it electronically makes our lives simpler in many cases, but the reality is that banks are shying away from their responsibilities to service the Australian public and to ensure they offer banking services. </span>

                  <a href="HX4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KATTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:46</span>):  This issue was touched off by an altercation I had with the cafeteria in Parliament House: I produced cash, and the lady said, 'We don't take cash; I'm sorry.' I said, 'You have to take cash, because it's legal tender.' When the original legislation was introduced providing for legal tender and for the Australian printery to be able to print money, the legislation was really very clear-cut that it was to be legal tender. That meant that you had a debt because you ordered an ice cream and they gave you the ice cream, and they had to take the money that the government produced for that purpose. For the banks to arrogate that power to themselves and take it off the Australian people is absolutely outrageous. I was reading the Qantas lounge, and I recommend that every person in this parliament read it and see how much powerful people can manipulate and misuse power for their benefit and the detriment of the public. It most certainly has occurred in the case of the banks. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia had the worst depression of any country on earth; I'm not going to go into all the figures. Germany went to 32 per cent unemployment. We went to 32 per cent unemployment and stayed there because some imbecile decided the government shouldn't produce money. You'd have a depression, but there was already a depression, and it was made infinitely worse by the government not producing money. I don't want to get too complicated with economics here, but it is very simple. The honourable members on my right and on my left have given myriad cases where it's required you take cash, but let me give you two small cases. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Quamby races attract a couple thousand people. Some glitch in the system meant they had no internet service. How can you have a rodeo with 2,000 people to feed and not have made a provision for taking cash? A wonderful day was completely wrecked. Infinitely more importantly, if the bank is giving you great trouble, you are able to withdraw the cash and get away before they come after you with an axe. But infinitely more important than that: don't you realise that, if you don't have cash, you'll have to get permission off the bank to buy a loaf of bread?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All the speakers emphasise elderly people wanting to use cash. It's funny, but you get a lot of young people on the internet and coming up—they thump me on the arm—saying 'Cash, brother, cash!' Young people understand the necessity to have cash. The hide of powerful people in society saying: 'No! I will have control of what you spend your money on! I am the banks!' Well, look at your record in Australia, banks! It's been absolutely appalling: the GFC, the Great Depression, a hundred examples I could give you. But it is very simple: if there's no cash then you have to get permission off the banks to buy a loaf of bread. Think about that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we applaud the government for moving on this. Very seldom do I see a government do this after we pull a little stunt—well, we didn't pull a little stunt; I just wanted to pay by cash—and I pay great tribute to Milton Dick, who found out about the altercation and confrontation, came racing down and put his foot down very unequivocally: 'You will take cash!' <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="HWN" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr COULTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parkes</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:51</span>):  This motion is most appropriate. One of the issues that constantly comes to my three offices in western New South Wales is vacancies and the need for more health professionals. As of yesterday, it's been 17 years since I was elected. The Member for Blair and I turned up on the same day. There have always been attempts to look for a silver bullet—the quick answer to fixing these problems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to health, we've actually made it considerably worse. The idea of paying health professionals, whether they're doctors, nurses or in allied health, considerably more to go and work as locums has actually meant that it is now a pathway for people to choose as a career. I asked why someone would choose to go and hang up their shingle and work for 40 or 50 years as a local GP when they can fly in and fly out and earn considerably more money? The problem with that is that the standard of health is much lower. It doesn't matter how qualified that person is; health is all about relationships. It's all about having a person you know and can trust and having those critical discussions—end-of-life care, aged care and all of those things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I could point to the time when I was a regional health minister and working with the then Rural Health Commissioner, Professor Ruth Stewart. We worked with ACRRM and considerably increased the numbers of training places for the generalist pathway. Part of the problem was that general practitioners were getting trained in specific areas but they didn't have the qualifications to go into a rural region where they may have needed more skills in emergency medicine but also other skills such as in anaesthetics or obstetrics—something that could benefit a broader range of patients.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a reluctance to go out, but changing the John Flynn program from being a student experience to putting that money into more actual training places in regional areas has significantly given more people that opportunity to train in a regional area. We've also had a generalist training program for allied health so they can actually have a broader range. It makes a difference. When this government came in and changed the rules around distribution priority areas, just so people know, those that live in the peri-urban areas, that week my electorate lost six doctors from the most underprivileged needy communities in western New South Wales. It was done for a reason. That was put in place so doctors who had obligations to meet as part of their qualification to work in Australia would go to certain areas. Six doctors went to less underprivileged areas, peri-urban areas, areas on the coast. That issue itself has been overhanging regional areas. I just want to leave the message to this place that decisions here matter. Everyone thinks they live in the most disadvantaged part of Australia. Even people in the capital cities talk about their need for more doctors. That's fine, but don't take them from western New South Wales, where the need is the greatest. I commend Dr Webster on her motion and understand that regional health is very important.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVO" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:56</span>):  I rise to speak on this motion from the member for Mallee and acknowledge the importance of this issue in my electorate. The Albanese Labor government has put forward a range of measures to address health workforce shortages and improve health outcomes for people living in rural, remote and regional Australia, including my regional electorate of Blair, which takes in rural parts of Ipswich and the Somerset region. At the outset, the government funds more than $1.9 billion a year for programs to develop the workforce and support a more equitable distribution of health professionals to areas of need, especially regional and rural areas. Our first budget put in place a range of increased incentives for doctors to practice in rural and remote communities like that of the member who's bringing this motion. It is very significant and rewards doctors moving to regional Australia with the skills they need. We've already seen the benefits of this investment, with a significant increase in the number of junior doctors commencing as GP trainees in 2024. In fact the last two years have seen the biggest increase in doctor numbers in a decade. We've also seen extra training places from an oversubscribed rural generalist training scheme, building our rural workforce. That's not fixing every problem in every single community, but more doctors, bulk-billing, Medicare urgent care clinics and Medicare mental health centres, like in my community, are starting to turn around the challenges we inherited from the coalition, who saw bulk-billing go into freefall.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know there are a range of levers we need to pull, and we're doing so. For example, in the education portfolio we put in place some very significant HECS or HELP debt relief for medical and nursing graduates who move to regional Australia. We put in place a number of single-employer model trials to try and deal with the industrialised disadvantage that GP registrars face in regional communities compared to their hospital based counterparts as well. The $3.5 billion investment put in place 12 months ago to triple the bulk-billing incentive is benefiting regional Australia more than our cities. We know about 40 per cent of more than five million additional free visits to a doctor that took place over the last 12 months happened in regional Australia. Australians living in regional, rural and remote areas will benefit from the $213.6 million package in the 2024-25 budget, delivering cheaper medicines, more access to scans and other tests and more free mental health services and investments in the health workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I acknowledge that this is an ongoing challenge in my community. In August last year, I held a roundtable on regional health, in Fernvale in the Somerset region in my electorate, with the Assistant Minister for Rural and Regional Health. It was attended by a number of participants from a range of professional bodies, service providers and local community groups, including Services for Australian Rural and Remote Allied Health, SARRAH, which the member referred to in her motion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A key focus of the forum was allied health workforce shortages and service access issues, which have a real impact on people living in the Somerset region. One of the things we discussed was that the government had just announced a health workforce review to address these issues and to ensure we optimise our health professionals, including allied health professionals, in regional, rural and remote areas. That review recently concluded, and the government is now carefully considering its recommendations along with other primary health care and workforce reviews. We look forward to seeing the outcome of that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Certainly, as a regional MP, I have been advocating for better healthcare services in my electorate. I am pleased to say that we delivered a Medicare urgent care clinic and a Head to Health, or Medicare mental health centre, in Ipswich. These proved to be very popular and made a real difference for patients in Blair, including people from rural areas who come in to Ipswich to access these services. Recently, the Minister for Health and Aged Care and I visited both facilities. We heard that the Ipswich urgent care clinic has had 11,000 presentations since it opened in August last year, while the Medicare mental health centre has had 1,660 appointments since it opened in May. I want to thank Dr Ajit Bhalla and the ForHealth team at the urgent care clinic and the Open Minds team at the mental health centre for their outstanding work in boosting bulk-billing health services in Ipswich. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister also met Dr Tony Bayliss and his partner and wife, Dr Cath Hester, of the Colleges Crossing Family Practice. Tony is the chair of the Darling Downs West Moreton PHN, and Cath is the Queensland chair of the RACGP Queensland. They talked about the issues in regional and rural areas. I'm pleased that we've got great practitioners across my electorate who contribute in this way. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WALLACE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:01</span>):  Regional communities like mine are in a healthcare crisis, and Australians have had a gutful of this Labor government's cuts and clumsy mismanagement of the healthcare sector. More than a quarter of the Australian population lives in regional, rural or remote Australia. Nearly a quarter of those Australians are over 65 years of age, when we all know people require more health care. They are more likely to need access to acute critical and/or long-term health care as well as aged care, disability and practical support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite this demand on their services, communities like mine have a dire shortage of general practitioners and primary healthcare workers. High turnover, skyrocketing costs and poor infrastructure and connectivity mean that GPs can't afford to practise and can't afford to set up a clinic or keep their doors open. We know this all too well in Fisher. I cannot tell you the number of emails and phone calls that I've received from GPs screaming out for help—screaming out for more doctors—because they are overworked, and, quite frankly, they are at the end of their tether. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since my election in 2016, I've stood shoulder to shoulder with the Fisher community in the fight for better healthcare infrastructure. I fought for mental healthcare services, and I remain committed to establishing the Sunshine Coast as a mental healthcare hub. To that end, I delivered $4 million to set up a headspace in Caloundra, which is now 18 months—long—overdue. Despite the continued hassling and pressuring of this government, they're only just now starting to talk about opening next month, which is going to be 18 months late. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I secured $8.3 million to establish the national PTSD centre in Birtinya, Australia's first PTSD research centre. I secured $11.4 million to set up and fund youth mental health and suicide prevention work through the University of the Sunshine Coast Thompson Institute alongside Roy and Nola Thompson. I secured $7.3 million to set up and operate Australia's first residential eating disorder facility at Wandi Nerida. I also secured funding for eating disorder recovery coaches, youth mental health events, men's sheds, veterans' wellbeing and psychosocial care. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now in opposition I am fighting for Fisher families to access the healthcare services we need. I spoke up for the community of Montville, who desperately needed a doctor. Hundreds of hinterland locals signed my 'Montville needs a doctor' petition, calling for the government to reconsider the funding model they apply to GP funding. Our petition and requests fell on the deaf ears of this Labor government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We stood up to Labor's reckless attack on community pharmacies. Labor's botched changes to dispensing, discounting arrangements and reckless red tape pushed community pharmacies to the brink. In Fisher, the uncertainty and skyrocketing costs drove some doors to close. As the shadow assistant minister and member for Mallee said so well, 'Labor's scorched earth approach to regional Australia has left some regional towns with their pharmacist as their sole primary healthcare provider—that is, if they still have a pharmacy.' Thankfully, alongside community pharmacies, the coalition fought to negotiate a new eighth community pharmacy agreement with the government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But as always, the coalition has a plan to remedy Labor's regional health crisis. We will invest $400 million to incentivise and equip the next generation of GPs for regional communities. We'll slash the red tape and cut the taxes that are crippling healthcare providers. We'll restore the telehealth system that Labor has sought to dismantle, and we will once again double the number of psychologist visits available under Medicare. One of the first things this health minister did was to dismantle the number of visits a person could make to a psychologist. This Labor government cut the funding for people who are at their most vulnerable, people who need to go and see a psychologist. The health minister cut that funding, shamefully and disgracefully. It meant that tens if not hundreds of thousands of Australians could not access appropriate psychologist visits. We will fix that when we win government, God willing, and if the Australian community supports us next year. </span>

Health, as you know, is a topic close to my heart, and I am interested in pathways for more generalist doctors, because I, too, was a generalist doctor. I worked as a medical doctor specialising in general medicine. I was essentially what is called a specialist generalist, which means, like GPs throughout this country, I saw everything that came through the door—and I mean everything. I, too, have had the privilege during my training and my career to work in many regional towns throughout this country, from Rocky to Armidale, Warrnambool, Orange, Coffs Harbour, Lismore, Rockingham, Bunbury, Burnie—I could go on and on. But every major hospital where I have worked in a metropolitan area has always had deep connections into rural and regional communities, because these were our referral pathways, and we were there also to take on calls and support our GPs in those regions as well as the few specialist doctors out there. It is an enduring regret of mine that I didn't end up in rural or regional medicine, because I really loved it when I was a trainee doctor and medical student. I just ended up getting seduced by metropolitan big-hospital frenetic medicine, and I really wasn't deliberative enough when I was making the decision about where to train and what to specialise in. And I didn't have any mentors at the time who could point me in the right direction. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The time I spent in regional communities was incredibly rewarding. It was like nothing I have ever experienced in the city, and I do mean that. You were stopped at supermarkets and at the church. People were caring, they were grateful to have a medical student or doctor working in their town, and they were interested in your wellbeing. I still remember a GP I worked with who provided a bike to help me get from my accommodation to the practice. Everyone in the clinic knew I had this bicycle and would wonder whether it was okay and whether I needed anything more. The medicine was rewarding, as was the gratitude, which came in bucketloads, and it was genuine. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what we are doing to support our rural and regional communities? By and large, patients want to see a doctor, and they would like to have a bulk-billing doctor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To that end we are opening urgent care clinics right around the country. We have already opened 78, with more to come, and some of these are in regional towns such as Albury, Shepparton, Bendigo, Ballarat, Rocky, Broome, Mount Gambier, Tamworth, Toowoomba, Ali Curung in the Northern Territory, Bunbury and Dapto in New South Wales. We have invested $1.9 billion in programs to boost the workforce, and this is already yielding benefits. Last year we saw an uplift in the number of people registering to practice as new doctors. In 2022-23 there were 8,356. In 2023-24 that number has gone up to 9,490. Moreover, we're seeing an increase, a 25 per cent uplift, in the number of doctors who want to become GPs. That is news to shout from the rooftops. We had 1,504 juniors doctors train as GPs, and in 2024-25 we're seeing an increase of nearly 250 on top of that, which is fantastic. In addition we're seeing more of those doctors spend more time in regional areas. Half of those junior doctors who are going through the GP training program will spend at least 12 months in the regions so they can get a taste of what I had back in the day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition we have reduced HELP or waived it entirely for GP registrars, meaning trainees, who go into general practice and work in the regions as well as for nurse practitioners, and the further out you go—the more remote, in other words—the more debt we will waive. In some circumstances the Commonwealth will actually pay 100 per cent of your HELP debt, which could be up to $70,000 for a doctor and $20,000 for a nurse practitioner. That is really good news. We've also seen an uplift in the amount of bulk-billing throughout the country but particularly in the regions. As you know, in our second budget we tripled the bulk-billing incentive, and that has translated to an additional 2.2 million visits to the GP that are bulk-billed. That is happening right across the country, with people in the regions actually the highest beneficiaries. We know there's more to do, but we are focused on strengthening Medicare, which is the backbone of the healthcare system.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:12</span>):  I thank the member for Mallee for bringing on this motion about the crisis in rural, remote and regional health. My father was a GP in Kempsey for 30-odd years, and one of the biggest kicks I get out of this job is when people, for example, at the markets on Saturday at Port Macquarie, come up and say to me, 'Your dad delivered my three kids' or—this actually happened last weekend—'I had a motorbike accident when I was 19, and I was in a coma for six weeks. Your dad saved my life, and he looked after me for many months after that.' I'm very proud of that fact. But it really is reflective of the fact that, long ago, doctors went to the regions and they stayed in the regions. Right now there are fewer doctors than there were in the seventies and eighties in my home town of Kempsey. That's the  problem we face not just with specialist generalist GPs but with health care across the board—occupational therapy, speech therapy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You can't make a GP go to the country. You can't push them out there; you can't force them and say, 'If you're going to be a GP and graduate from university after six, eight, 10 years, you've got to go to the country.' That's not fair on them. People need to make that decision as to what their future looks like. But we can certainly put things in place to incentivise our young people who are basically putting their life on hold to get through their medical degree. My nephew is doing one at Wagga Wagga right now. We know if people study in the regions, they settle in the regions. Generally they might meet a boyfriend or girlfriend, spend time there and decide to settle. We need to build up that relationship with our universities to get our young people into regional and rural programs or degrees so they go to the country, go to regional and rural areas, study and stay. The other thing we can do is incentivise to get those people out into the country, whether that's through tax concessions or helping them with housing, which is a huge problem at the moment. It's all well and good to have somebody come to the region—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr CONAGHAN:</span>
                  </a>  I was in the throes of talking about incentivising general specialists as well as allied health professionals into the region. I note the coalition's work with the National Rural Generalist Pathway back in 2017. The coalition have committed to $400 million to incentivise rural and regional practitioners. We also need to restore telehealth. In the absence of those practitioners, the second-best practice is telehealth, and to see cuts in this area is disappointing. But we do need that backup system in the absence of having people on the ground. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In finishing up, I want to highlight two of the government's policies that have seriously affected regional Australia. The first one was the change to the distribution priority area. For those of you who don't know, this allowed overseas doctors to practise in the regions to ensure that we filled that void where it was needed. Unfortunately, Labor changed that to include peri-urban areas. In my electorate alone, I've heard that we've lost four doctors. The member for Parkes said he'd lost six doctors. That is across Australia. Those doctors moved from regional and remote areas because they could, because of the changes that Labor made. It made it more difficult to access services in the regions. The second one was reducing visits covered by Medicare for mental health issues from 20 to 10. We have committed that we will restore those visits back to 20 when we get back into government next term. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:26</span>):  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are more likely to live in urban and regional areas. The proportion of First Nations people living outside these centres increases with remoteness. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people make up just 1.9 per cent of people living in major cities but 32 per cent in remote and very remote areas of Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Access to quality health care shouldn't be dependent on where you live. My electorate of Lingiari includes all of the Northern Territory's regional and remote Aboriginal communities, making up around 61,000 people and representing 26.3 per cent of the Northern Territory's population. A priority for me is increasing access to culturally safe and appropriate health care for all constituents in my electorate that is delivered in true partnership with local people and communities. These partnerships not only build a stronger health system for rural, remote and regional Australia; importantly, they ensure the system is equipped to better meet the complex and multilayered health challenges facing people living in these locations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A good example of effective partnership at work was the rollout of the Medicare urgent care clinics across Australia. The Albanese Labor government is increasing the number of Medicare urgent care clinics, including six new clinics announced for remote regions in my electorate. The six new clinics will be at Ali-Curung, Galiwinku, Alyangula, Wurrumiyanga, Lajamanu and Maningrida—very remote communities but with big populations. These are in addition to the two new clinics that have already been established in Palmerston and the regional town of Alice Springs, or Mparntwe, which has been ranked No. 1 in terms of visitation and usage by any urgent care clinic. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The locations of these remote clinics were chosen in partnership with the Northern Territory Department of Health and the Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance Northern Territory. Their involvement ensured that these clinics are best placed to meet the priority needs of remote Aboriginal communities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The new clinics are also being adapted to local circumstances and will operate differently from other Medicare urgent care clinics in Australia. Innovative workforce models have been designed and new service delivery approaches are being developed to help reduce the number of aeromedical retrievals from these communities. The cost of air evacuations out of these communities can be in excess of $50,000 for just one emergency medevac. This will ease the burden on existing primary healthcare services. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also a number of dialysis units in remote and very remote communities, which will allow a lot of Aboriginal people to stay closer to home and be treated on country. Four communities in my electorate have also been invited to apply for grants under Labor's $73.2 million investment in better renal services for First Nations people. These communities were chosen based on the number of people requiring dialysis and their distance from existing services. I have to applaud our federal Minister for the Environment and Water for putting substantial investment toward stable and reliable water supply services in these communities so that these renal dialysis machines can operate effectively.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we can keep people on country, it means that their families can stay and be part of their broader healthcare and treatment. Labor's investment in better water security under the National Water Grid Fund will ensure good-quality water, which most of us take for granted, can be available in remote First Nations communities, which is vital for dialysis treatment. Better renal services are about increasing access to life-saving dialysis treatment for First Nations people in remote communities. It shows true partnership between two federal government programs and is a very practical example of working in tandem to close the gap for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people by improving the livability of remote and very remote communities through safe, secure and reliable water. That supports better health and well-being outcomes.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  I want to draw the parliament's attention to the plight of one of my constituents—let's call him John. John is an 85-year-old pensioner who lives in North Sydney. He has passionately advocated about the impossible position he and many others find themselves in during their latter years, trying to survive on the age pension. John has done everything right. He's worked hard, paid his taxes, educated his kids and paid off the mortgage on a modest flat. Now he's a pensioner living independently in his own home. But while John is asset rich, his sole income on a single pension is just $500 a week. And just as John has asked me on many occasions, I now ask the parliament: how does someone live comfortably on that amount with limited to no potential to earn additional income?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John has tried to find work to supplement his pension, but at the age of 85 the pickings are slim and, heartbreakingly, the experience of applying for jobs has been demoralising. He's been spoken to rudely and even hung up on. As he said, in his own words, 'I haven't been so insulted in my whole life.' In this context, I implore the government to reflect deeply on our social services framework, particularly the plight of pensioners who are being crushed by the rising cost of living. If recipients of Australian Commonwealth welfare are not safe from poverty then we have some serious soul searching to do.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:01</span>):  Constituents in my electorate can be assured that my No. 1 priority as the member for Dunkley as well as the Albanese Labor government's priority is addressing cost-of-living pressures on households. We know that people in our communities are doing it tough. That's why we've been laser focused on providing cost-of-living relief for all Australians. It's why we've delivered tax cuts for every taxpayer, not just some, meaning that more people will keep more of what they earn. We've delivered $300 in energy bill relief for every Australian household and $325 for every small business. We've delivered wage increases for those on minimum wages, with three consecutive increases to minimum wages across 2022, 2023 and 2024. This is on top of pay rises for early childhood workers and aged-care workers. We've also delivered cheaper medicines, making hundreds of common medicines cheaper by allowing millions of Australians to buy two months worth of medicines for the price of a single prescription.</span>

As we approach Christmas, these groups are working extra hard to bring some joy to those who are doing it tough over the festive season. Where I can, I'm happy to support these efforts, including the Upper Murray Family Care and Centre Against Violence gift appeal. Upper Murray Family Care provides foster care and support for families, and last year their appeal provided presents and school supplies to more than 384 children. UMFC is accepting donations of books, school supplies, and presents such as toys, sporting goods and gift cards for those aged from newborn to 18 years. Something like a movie ticket for a teenager can make such a difference.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The rising cost of living means that increasing numbers of people are turning towards services like FoodShare in order to put food on the table. Albury Wodonga Regional FoodShare provides food relief and festive hampers to those who are struggling to make ends meet. You can help by donating money or non-perishable food, by nominating someone to receive a hamper or by volunteering. My offices in Wodonga and Wangaratta are drop-off points for gift and food donations to both UMFC's gift appeal and Albury Wodonga Regional FoodShare's Christmas Hunger Relief Appeal to assist our community in helping others this festive season. Let's all chip in to make sure everyone has a merry Christmas.</span>

These are things like improved pedestrian crossings, fencing, street lighting, footpaths, pedestrian refuges, barriers and so much more. There are nine projects in the Hawkesbury and nearly that many in the Blue Mountains—and I'm just going to give you a couple of examples.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">For instance, at Ellison Road in Springwood, there'll be the construction of a footpath. This is near one of our busiest schools. At the Great Western Highway in Hazelbrook, at the public school where a terrible accident has occurred, there will now be safety barriers on that Great Western Highway stretch.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also a couple of projects in Katoomba, Leura, Wentworth Falls and Blaxland, in the Hawkesbury. There are things like South Windsor, the construction of pram ramps and protected pedestrian access. There's work in George Street, Bligh Park, where goodness knows we need more pedestrian refuges—and people have spoken to me about those. These are great projects across the Hawkesbury and the Blue Mountains.</span>

This year, it was six children in year 2: Ari, Annie and Jerry from Earlwood Public School and Lanna, Amelia and Hussain from Carlton Public School. In the busyness of the festive period, I enjoy taking time to appreciate the creative talents of the young people in the electorate of Barton. Lanna and Amelia have created colourful abstract works in watercolours, Annie and Jerry have portrayed Santa in more traditional scenes and Ari's Santa is ready for the beach in his swimming trunks. The Grinch makes an appearance in Hussain's drawing. Please don't take it personally if you get a Grinch card.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:08</span>):  I will be speaking more about scams and victims soon, but right now I want to speak about Emily from Mildura, in my electorate. Emily is an older Australian; she's 82 years old. She lost her husband in June. Forty-four days later, her computer screen went blue and a message purporting to be from Microsoft urged her to call a 1800 number. Scammers tricked Emily into believing they were the antiscamming authorities and duped Emily into participating in a sting operation using her bank account details. She lost $157,000 from these scums of the earth.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What did her bank offer her by way of reimbursement? They offered $22.36. Emily told me late last week she felt dirty and ashamed and didn't want to tell her family what happened. Emily's family tell me Emily is computer savvy. She's alert, and she's not easily fooled. I dare anyone to call Emily stupid. I made that point to the representatives of Emily's bank in my office here last week, and I am pleased to report reimbursement has been agreed to. It should not take a federal member's involvement for action to occur. There is so much work to be done. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:14</span>):  As 2024 draws to a close, I give a shout-out to the massive people power movement that has grown to prominence this year: #keepthesheep. Never before in my 11 years as a regional MP have I seen rural and urban Australians rise up as a grassroots force fighting to save the live sheep export trade. This 'farmy army' supports those who work hard every day to provide the food and fibre on which we all rely and deliver our international trading partners clean, green Aussie produce. Most Australians don't want to see this viable industry end just to support a woke agenda hellbent on destroying livelihoods of farmers, transporters, feedlot operators, shearers, stock agents and exporters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The #keepthesheep movement has recruited over 105,000 supporters and amassed a war chest approaching $1 million. Just as Labor claimed their 2022 election win gave them a mandate to end this vital trade, #keepthesheep is sending a clear message to put Labor last in 2025. Their dedicated volunteers have been doorknocking for months, targeting key Labor held seats. But this campaign won't end in WA. No Labor seat is safe. They have only just started to fight and they're taking their battle to prepoll and to the booths on polling day. The hardworking people of the bush are fighting back: #keepthesheep.</span>

Dawn is my husband's nanna, my children's great-grandma—and boy is she a great woman—and she is my nanna-in-law. I feel really blessed to be a part of this family, and she is an incredible matriarch. She has two sons and three daughters, and Dawn might not use the term 'feminist', but she has been so supportive of her daughter's careers. One is a mathematician/accountant, another an early-childhood-educator/nurse, the other primary school teacher. It's interesting because it Dawn didn't actually get to finish her formal schooling. She only went to school until the age of 14. The thing that has been interesting is seeing the way that her values have disseminated throughout the multiple generations of her family.</span>

What it comes down to is that this is a family of Labor values. Many of the things Dawn had been able to do were because of Labor governments such as Gough Whitlam's. I feel really blessed to be a part of this family.</span>

Parkruns meet every Saturday morning and are run by volunteers for the community. Running is a key part of my life and a key part of our family life. I run with my children every Tuesday and Friday, and sometimes they join me for the parkruns on Saturday. We say the hardest part of it is putting your shoes on. Always turn up; never give up. Running is a metaphor for life.</span>

To those in the Westerfolds parkrun—73,000 finishers and over 700 volunteers, and those hills are brutal. I experienced that recently. Just outside my electorate in the member for Chisholm's electorate is the Gardiners Creek parkrun, but many from my electorate use it. There have been 79,000 finishers and 992 volunteers, and you've got to dodge the off-lead dogs in that area. To the timekeepers—those who scan the barcodes, lift morale at the start, keep the pace and are there for you at the end—I want to say thank you. These are a wonderful part of our community, and I'm very grateful to all of you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:19</span>):  I know that, for many living in our communities right across the country, there is some frustration about the resolution of visa status for those who had asylum claims rejected under the flawed fast-track process under the previous government. I've met with a group of asylum seekers and protesters in this situation at my electorate office, and Minister Burke also met with a group of asylum seekers and protesters in exactly this situation at his electorate office a few weeks ago. I've also met with a number of local community groups about this issue. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand people are in limbo, and I too want this limbo to end. Many people have been in this situation for over a decade. Under the previous government, a large number of people who had had their asylum claims rejected under the fast-track process were told that they couldn't stay but weren't sent home or to another country. This meant that they have been living in communities and in limbo for over a decade. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to see a resolution to this situation for the thousands of people still waiting. I've spoken to the minister's office, and the minister is working through the composition of this entire group with the Department of Home Affairs to try and get a sensible outcome on a case-by-case basis. </span>

Heartfelt congratulations to Madara Perera, Mahesi Nisansala, Malisha Fernando, Niroshi Peiris, Ranmi Peiris, Shanika Burke, Shahni Guruge and Vishodha Sankani for graduating and for your dedication and hard work in mastering traditional Sri Lankan dance under the guidance of the amazing Janali Herath, the director of her own dance company, the Jannali Dance Academy. </span>

Professor Disanayaka is the only person who has received an award in Sri Lanka as a professional dancer. </span>

It was a really special community celebration when the Assistant Minister for Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, Emma McBride, and I stood alongside the young people of Kiama who have helped shape this essential service. Tuesday 15 October was a day for the community to come out and share a few laughs, to consume way too many colourful doughnuts and to be thankful to the Albanese government for providing young people with access to free mental health care and support. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm so thrilled to see this service up and running. I have been fighting on behalf of the community to establish headspace in Kiama, which also supports our young people living in Gerringong, Jamberoo and surrounding villages. The youth in the region previously had to travel to Nowra or Wollongong to access headspace services, so a dedicated headspace in Kiama is helping to alleviate these barriers. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Headspace Kiama supports local schools, youth and mental health services that have wrapped their arms around young people and the community following the tragic loss of young lives to suicide. There has been no greater need for this facility than in Kiama, which is why I fought so hard for it. </span>

The show is an iconic event in the north-east Tasmanian social calendar, and like many country shows it's an important occasion for social connection. This year's show was no exception, with fine weather drawing families from across the region to share in all the fun of a traditional country show, with an outstanding offering of livestock, equestrian, handcrafts, gardening and baking, as well as shearing and working-dog displays, animal nursery and machinery. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the great pleasure of participating in the judging panel for the state rural ambassador program. Congratulations to this year's winner, Dylan Bellchambers, and to the runner-up, Alice Hall, who were both extremely high quality candidates. I also enjoyed once again judging the miss and master show competitions across several age categories, which is always lots of fun. Well done to everyone who participated!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The show takes an enormous number of volunteer hours through the year in planning and preparation, as well as the hard work during the two days of the show. It was a credit to President Alice Hall, Secretary Emma Larkin and a committee of all volunteers who were very tired by Saturday afternoon but all still smiling and cheerful. Congratulations to everyone involved on another successful show. I look forward to the 120th birthday celebrations in 2025.</span>

It's a powerful reminder of the crisis facing countless women and families—a crisis that demands reflection and action. For some, this fight is deeply personal, but all of us must tackle family violence. It is a scourge in our society, and it must end.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why the Albanese government has made record investments to tackle family, domestic and sexual violence, making the safety of women and children a national priority. We're delivering almost $4.4 billion in new funding to address gender based violence, investing in frontline legal services and housing initiatives to prevent violence. This is on top of our $4 billion in funding to support the National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just about dollars; it's also about legislative reform like 10 days of paid family and domestic violence leave so that women don't have to choose between their job and their safety and improving family law so it's safer and fairer and less adversarial for women giving evidence. Of course, there is always more to do, and every day we must stand together to build an Australia where all women and girls are safe and free from violence.</span>

Right now, farmers across Durack are in the thick of harvest. It's the busiest and most demanding time of the year. It's a time when every call, every text and every connection counts. Whether it's coordinating harvesters or trucks, accessing real-time weather updates or ensuring that an emergency response is only a call away, connectivity isn't just optional; you know that it is critical.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that, for many, the arrival of 4G and 5G has been welcomed. Indeed, the changes have made lots of improvements to people's data and streaming capabilities. But this is not the case for many out in the bush. In fact, I'm told by the CBH Group that, for this harvest, telecommunications connectivity has been the biggest issue they have been experiencing. To those farmers and community members out there, to be able to help you, I need you to help me. Please share your experiences with me. Tell me how the end of 3G has affected you, your farm, your family and your community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:27</span>):  Bendigo is home to a number of great female athletes, particularly when it comes to team sports. The Bendigo Spirit is our local team competing in the Australian WNBL. They are one of three Victorian teams. I'm proud to stand here and say that they've had a fantastic start to this year's season. Currently, they sit top of the ladder after winning six of their games so far. They are the only team to be undefeated in the competition. I'm proud to be a player sponsor of Lavinia Cox, who is an 18-year-old Bendigo local taking the next step up from being a standout junior in the Bendigo Basketball pathways program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This weekend was also round 6 of the Lisa Chesters Shield, the senior women's cricket competition in Bendigo. I've been the sponsor of the shield since its inception, and it's an example of how women love their cricket too and love to be able to play at the grassroots level. They love their club cricket. The Bendigo Thunder, which is another of our amazing women's teams, were one of the inaugural teams in the women's Central Victorian Football League. While the football season is over, they've already started their preseason training. It's just a demonstration of the commitment that these women have to their sport.</span>

It's that time of year again, when the shopping centres buzz, many disciplined diets and exercise regimes are put aside, homes are decorated and families come together to celebrate Christmas. For fathers, it's a stark reminder of the difficult financial situation they are in as family budgets are stretched to their limits, trying to accommodate gift requests from children and supply family meals for those hosting Christmas lunch.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the true Christmas meaning is a celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ. Upon examination of his life, he never appears to have done anything for himself or for personal gratification. Instead, he spent his entire life helping others. Whether it be providing food for the hungry, comfort for the weak or suffering, or healing for the emotionally or physically sick, Jesus's life was of one of complete selflessness—a life that is worth remembering and celebrating this Christmas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm so proud to represent a community that, in many ways, exemplifies these wonderful attributes of Jesus, whether they are faith based or not. We have so many community and faith based organisations that reach out and meet the needs of the Longman community not just at Christmas time but every day of the year. So to everyone out there, consider being part of one of these groups for just this festive season and do something for your fellow man. Merry Christmas, everyone, and stay safe into the new year.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:30</span>):  I remember when each of my three children turned 18. As a father, it was a big occasion. One evening, my daughters and son were still children; the next morning, they woke up as adults. Like all adults, they had new responsibilities. They could vote, and they would be treated as adults under the law. But currently, 18-year-olds working in the retail, fast food and pharmacy industries are not required to be paid as adults.</span>

                  </span>The Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association is asking the Fair Work Commission to lift wages for young workers. The campaign seeks to end junior rates of pay for workers aged 18 and above. A junior rate means that an 18-year-old working full time is earning $15,000 less than they should be. This campaign also asks for rates and pay to be lifted for workers under the age of 18. I have been fortunate to work with many young workers who are hard-working, full of ideas and enthusiasm, and sometimes by the time they are 18 they already have several years of experience. There is no reason that young workers should be paid any less. It is simple. Adult age workers deserve adult pay.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:32</span>):  The exceptionally good people of Queensland have elected a Crisafulli LNP government to address their major concerns—the soaring cost of living, including electricity prices; skyrocketing crime rates; lack of housing options; and a health system that was in crisis. I take this opportunity to thank Queenslanders and assure you all that the new LNP government is hard at work to improve your lives. You have placed your trust in the right premier who has the right priorities.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate the 10 LNP members on the Gold Coast, including the Premier, and the newly elected Hermann Vorster for Burleigh, as well as the eight incumbent MPs from the Gold Coast region who were re-elected to the Queensland Legislative Assembly. Some of them are now ministers of the Crown. I thank all the volunteers and supporters who backed their local MPs. I thank candidate Bianca Stone for her team's herculean efforts in Gaven, which fell just a few hundred votes short this time.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I wish to call out the very bad behaviour of the sitting Labor member in the electorate of Mansfield in Brisbane. We saw her and the Transport Workers' Union verbally abuse, bully, intimidate and conduct a defamatory campaign against the LNP candidate through social media and letterboxing. A widely respected leader of the GOPIO community, Pinky Singh, who has an OAM for her dedication to her community, was a target of Labor's vile attacks. This type of behaviour is unacceptable, and I'm calling it out for what it is—a disgraceful reflection on a desperate Labor Party.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:34</span>):  The Cranbourne Pony Club in Holt is a haven for young riders, passionate about equestrian sports. During my visits, especially to their Sunday rallies, I saw firsthand the incredible work they do in fostering a love for horses and the outdoors. The club's monthly rallies, competitions and hands-on learning opportunities help young riders develop skills and friendships that will last a lifetime. For many, the club also serves as a pathway to careers in the equine industry. Equestrian sports are at the heart of Cranbourne's identity. With the Cranbourne Racecourse—one of the largest training facilities in the Southern Hemisphere—nearby, the region is a proud hub for the horseracing industry across Victoria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Cranbourne Pony Club is a wonderful example of the benefits of equestrian sports, including resilience, teamwork and a strong sense of community. My heartfelt thanks goes to John Dillon, the dedicated volunteers and the coaches who tirelessly nurture young riders and teach them invaluable life skills. Thank you for supporting the next generation of equestrians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Nicholls</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:35</span>):  Today, along with my co-chair, the member for Adelaide, the Parliamentary Friends of Albania will be officially launched. It may surprise people that migration from Albania started in 1885, with the first major phase in the 1920s. In Shepparton, they had up to 500 Albanian migrants by the late 1930s, attracted by the employment opportunities in the orchards of the region. They worked hard and were successful, so much so that newspapers a world away in Sydney published articles suggesting a quarter of Shepparton's inhabitants were 'aliens' and that the town was becoming a second Albania. But on the ground was a story of cohesion. Albanian performers joined concerts, and the CWA welcomed Albanian women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following World War II, many sought citizenship, and, with the onset of communist rule, a second wave left Albania for Australia. In the 1950s, Shepparton Albanians established their own Albanian Moslem Society and began fundraising. In 1960, an Albanian mosque opened in Shepparton, and it is a welcoming place for all of us in the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The community continues to thrive and add to the prosperity of the region—people like cafe owner Karen Resul, orchardist and transport company owner the late Sam Sali, businessman Reg Qemel, Mayor Shane Sali and property developer Safet Kutrolli. People of Albanian descent are making huge contributions to our nation, and tonight we celebrate them and our growing friendship with this burgeoning European country. Thank you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:36</span>):  My electorate of Hasluck has lost a local leader who has given so much to others. Bevan O'Donnell, known as 'Uncle Bevan', was, for so many, a well-loved and a well-respected member of the Midland community. Growing up in Midland with his 10 siblings, at the age of seven Bevan took up boxing and fought for the Midland police and citizens youth club. He went on to represent Australia as an amateur boxer in 1978.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1987, Bevan, with his brothers, founded the Wally Bates Memorial Boxing Club, in honour of their coach. Their goal was to continue Wally's legacy, passing on the values of discipline, self-confidence, self-esteem and community service. To this day, the club continues its community focus, charging only $2 per night. On Wally's headstone reads a simple phrase: 'A sportsman, a gentleman'. Uncle Bevan not only continued this legacy but expanded upon it, not just through the club but in his role with the Western Australia Police Force as an Aboriginal police liaison officer and senior constable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year, Uncle Bevan was awarded the Australian Police Medal, recognising his service to the community. When I met Uncle Bevan, I was quickly taken by his friendly demeanour and his distinctive laugh. With a disarming charm, Uncle Bevan treated us all with kindness and respect. I give my condolences to Uncle Bevan's family in this difficult time. He will be mourned by the community, and the void he leaves is not easily filled. Bevan O'Donnell: a life of service to others.</span>

With this special day fast approaching, I wanted to quickly speak about some of the fantastic events that are on over the next couple of weeks in the region in Central Queensland. There is the Biloela Christmas Festival, Blackwater QCWA Twilight Christmas Markets and the Mount Larcom District Progress Association Christmas Fair, which is on this Saturday. I'm sure this will be enjoyed by each of those communities. Make sure to say 'g'day' to the Flynn team if you see us out and about at one of these events. There's also the Gayndah Christmas Market, on from 4 December until 8 December, the Gladstone Mayor's Carols on 6 December and the Moore Park Beach Christmas seaside event on 15 December. This is only a few of the many events that are on in Central Queensland.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many organisations across Central Queensland that spread a little Christmas cheer over the holiday period by coordinating activities and appeals to help people who might be in need, and I thank these organisations for the valuable work that they can do. In conclusion, it has been a privilege to serve and represent Flynn in the federal parliament in 2024. My team and I look forward to serving the Flynn electorate into the new year and continue our commitment to take Flynn forward.</span>

Alwyn spent 30 years on Newcastle streets, lost to his family and friends, struggling with PTSD following the Vietnam War. Matthew Kelly's coverage of Alwyn's life was compassionate and compelling, exposing the reality of homelessness and putting a human face on those too often overlooked. Remarkably, the Kelly series led to Alwyn Craig being reunited with his family after three decades of heartache. Matthew Kelly's work exemplifies journalism at its best. In an age where local stories are often overlooked, he consistently highlights the voices of regional communities like mine. I was delighted to recently host an afternoon tea with Alwyn Craig, his brother Ronald, his sister-in-law June, Hayley Catford from RSL LifeCare veterans' services and John Cross from City Sleep Safe. I had the privilege to present Alwyn with two certificates of appreciation as part of the Australian government's Saluting Their Service program, belatedly recognising his military service in Vietnam and Singapore.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Walkley Award celebrates Matthew's exceptional journalism. It serves as a reminder of the vital role regional journalism plays in our communities and Australia's democracy in ensuring that every voice is heard. Congratulations, Matthew Kelly. Your Walkley Award is very well-deserved.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:41</span>):  The misinformation bill is dead thanks to the collective tireless efforts of Australians and a few of their representatives in this parliament. From the moment it first appeared in 2023, I slammed this bill, writing to the Leader of the Opposition to express my strongest objections. The legislation was and always has been an offence to democracy. What made the government think they could be the purveyors of their truth? Just look at the COVID track record. We were told 15 days to slow the spread; instead we had two years of border closures and harsh lockdowns. We were told masks weren't effective. Then they were. Then you only had to wear them standing up and not sitting down—madness. We were also told that, if you take the vaccine, you won't get COVID and you won't infect other people—more lies. Emails show that Australian experts knew the shots didn't stop infection or transmission, yet the vaccines were mandated anyway. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Department of Home Affairs censored 4,000 social media posts under the guise of misinformation—posts that turned out to be completely and utterly true. Australia's COVID inquiry showed trust in government institutions has been decimated. Why? Because the government was the largest purveyor of misinformation over the past four years, and the people knew it. The people have spoken, and the mad bill is dead. Today we celebrate, but let's not rest. The social media bill is set to bring about digital ID by stealth. The government says, 'don't worry; it's voluntary', but the government will try to make life impossible without one. So they do at their peril; the people have spoken. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:43</span>):  I wanted to take a moment today to remember a man whose contributions to our community were as impactful as they were heartfelt. Greg Turner, sadly, passed away at the age of 64, leaving behind a legacy of community advocacy and compassion. As a local journalist, Greg's career was remarkable. At SBS he covered the harrowing realities of the Bosnian war in the early 1990s, a testament to his bravery and commitment to uncovering the truth. Later, as a reporter for local institution the<span style="font-style:italic;"> Weekly Times</span>, Greg became a familiar face in Ryde and Hunters Hill, attending council meetings and keeping the community informed on everything from civic issues to local sports. His reporting was deeply valued and important to holding local politicians to account. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But Greg's passions extended far beyond the newsroom. He was a devoted animal lover and he championed the work of the World League for the Protection of Animals, promoting their no-kill shelter in Gladesville. His love for felines inspired the much-loved 'Cat of the Week' feature in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Weekly Times</span>, which helped rehome over 200 cats locally. It's impossible to overstate the joy and connection Greg brought to our community through both his stories and his kindness. Whether reporting on council amalgamations or supporting local community initiatives, Greg worked tirelessly for the betterment of others and the noble cause of keeping people informed. Rest in peace, Greg Turner. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that small business is the cornerstone of many of our communities. They are out there every day employing locals, seeking not just to create wealth for themselves as the owners of those businesses but also to create opportunity, employment and wealth for their employees and for the nation as a whole. But it's not just about the people they employ. It's also about what they give back to the community. Many of our small businesses are intimately involved in our local community groups, sporting organisations and other community activities. They're out there each and every day. You see them at presentation nights, when they're thanked for supporting a local charity in its work in, for example, supporting the homeless. Or you'll see their signs or their advertising on the jerseys of your local sporting clubs through the sponsorships they pay to help these clubs get through the season and cover their costs of operation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, as we've seen often over the past nearly three years, small business and the importance of small business seems to be anathema to this government. What we already knew after three years was confirmed in Labor's recent economic statement: that they've made bad decisions and have wrong priorities, and one area that is suffering enormously as a result is small business. We hear often about the cost-of-living crisis and the impact it is having on households. What we don't hear so much about is this cost-of-living crisis and its impact on small businesses: the increasing costs of rent, electricity, staff, and food and services in the hospitality sector. And over the course of the past 2½ years we've seen the average rent costs for small businesses increase by some 16½ per cent, electricity costs by 30 per cent and gas costs by nearly 34 per cent. In addition, we've seen personal income tax collections grow by 25 per cent, and food and input costs for many of the small hospitality business and cafe owners I talk to have increased significantly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is evidenced by the level of business insolvency. Businesses are the canary in the coalmine for the consequences of actions of this government. Business insolvencies are at a record high, and this has been overseen by the Labor government, including the highest number of business insolvencies on record in a single month, with 1,364 Australian businesses going under in October 2024. And under the two and a bit years of the current Labor government, nearly 25,000 Australian businesses have gone insolvent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, Australian now has 85,000 fewer apprentices and trainees, and in the construction industry there has been a 22 per cent decrease in the number of apprentices. Businesses have also been hit with additional red tape, with 82 per cent of small business indicating that it is having a major to moderate impact on their operations. Part of the reason for this is the major increase in insurance costs for small business. At a recent manufacturing roundtable I held, insurance costs were one of the main issues that were raised with me by those businesses, with 92 per cent of small businesses experiencing significantly increased insurance costs compared with 12 months ago. And the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman has reported that many businesses can't afford the prohibitive premiums that in some cases have risen by 200 or 300 per cent.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">With these additional costs of living or imposts on the costs of doing business, and the additional administrative burden affecting small business, it's not hard to see why fewer people are opting to start their own small business, which means that we have a generational gap. When our average small-business owner is in their mid-50s and they are looking to retire, we have nobody to replace them. This government should hang its head in shame with the way it has treated small business.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M3E" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROB MITCHELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McEwen</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:50</span>):  I rise to speak on this private members' motion on small business. On this side, we recognise that Australian small businesses are doing it tough. When we came to office, inflation was racing at an upward pace. Interest rates were also screaming upwards. With Australians feeling the effects of the cost-of-living crisis and high global inflation rates, small businesses—enterprises that everyday Australians pour their heart and soul into—felt the full brunt of the economic conditions that we inherited. That's why we have put in place a range of support and funding to help our mum-and-dad local businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After the largesse that was delivered through COVID, which fired inflation through the roof and left many small businesses behind, we recognise that small businesses help drive the nation's economy and that they are the heart of local communities across the country—especially for communities like ours in McEwen, where small businesses are a hub for families, friends and community groups. Small business employs millions of Australians, whether it be a 14-year-old on their first job or someone who has pursued a career with small business. We know they are the engine room of Australia's economy. That's why, in the most recent budget, the Albanese Labor government committed to helping ease the pressure on Australia's small businesses, whether through energy relief or making sure that over $640 million is going to practical, targeted support—and doing this without adding pressure that sends inflation back on the increase.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The most important thing for any small business experiencing challenges is that support and assistance is available. Across Australia, 2.5 million small businesses can access support that is focused on saving them money and time, reducing administrative burdens and making it easier for small businesses to fulfil their obligations, including a business tax cut through the $20,000 instant asset write-off. The opposition made it seem like we were moving heaven and earth. We are glad they eventually agreed to reintroduce this simple and easy cost-of-living relief for small businesses, after they slashed it in 2013. Additionally, we are extending the instant asset write-off for a further year, until June 2025. This will provide small businesses with the confidence and the ability to invest. It is estimated that, over the two years, this measure will provide $580 million in support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is also abolishing 457 tariffs in the largest unilateral reform in two decades. The topic of tariffs has been prevalent in the cultural zeitgeist recently. I'm sure people can understand the importance of removing nuisance tariffs, because the removal of these tariffs will cut more compliance costs for small businesses, creating better economic opportunities for Australians and making importation costs for materials cheaper. You always hear politicians talking about the quality of Australian-made things, but this government has actually been putting its money where its mouth is. We know Australia produces some of the best-quality goods and services in the world and that is why we are backing them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since coming to government, we have updated the Commonwealth procurement rules—changes that mean small Australian businesses are getting a bigger slice of $75 billion in contracts that we spend every year. We have set ambitious targets to make sure that 40 per cent of contracts that are up to $20 million in value go to small businesses, and 25 per cent of contracts that are worth up to $1 billion, because only an Australian Labor government will back Australian small businesses and give them the opportunities that they deserve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfair contract terms are now illegal, thanks to our actions, so small businesses can negotiate fair agreements with their larger partners. The Buy Australian Plan is opening the door to more government work for more small and medium businesses by simplifying procurement procedures. Small businesses can continue to count on the Albanese Labor government to back them every step of the way. Since coming to government, we have provided two energy bill relief measures and we're continuing to build on the $650 rebate that was provided in the last financial year. This has been there to combat the near decade of the former coalition government's neglecting of the energy sector and refusing any direction, which caused great angst to those in small business. Time and time again, we hear that they're the party of small business, but they never put their money where their mouth is, only providing small businesses and hardworking Australians with platitudes and empty cheques for photo-ops. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll continue to keep working for small business because we actually have backgrounds. Despite the untruths that get said by those opposite, we're supporting new jobs, supporting new skills, supporting new trade, supporting new taxation and supporting the market, which are so important to keeping our small businesses growing—not empty rhetoric. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="201906" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr YOUNG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:55</span>):  I rise today to speak on the private member's motion moved by the member for Forde. Small and family businesses, or SMEs, are part of the backbone of the Australian economy. These enterprises are often started by everyday Australians who simply have a dream. Many work hard for years or even decades to pay down their mortgages and to realise enough equity to approach a lender to use this equity as collateral to fulfil their dream of starting their own business. They literally risk everything they own, and they contribute so much to our economy by doing so. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">SMEs employ 42 per cent of all apprentices and trainees in training. They contribute an astounding $600 billion to the national GDP, or around a third. They employ 42 per cent of Australians in the private sector, and the 2.5 million SMEs employ around five million hardworking Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most important aspects in the economy space for any Australian government is to ensure that these entrepreneurial Aussies are not burdened with red tape and bureaucracy that prevent them from the most important role of their vocation—that is, the ability to work on their business so they can become more productive and profitable. This leads them to employ more people and invest in more equipment and systems, which creates economic growth for our great nation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, when I'm speaking to small- and medium-business owners in the electorate of Longman, which I proudly serve, many feel the exact opposite is happening. These hardworking Australians feel bound by stifling legislation and red tape introduced by this anti-small-business Labor government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Good governments understand and ensure by their policies and legislation that SMEs need fewer burdens, not more. Good governments understand that SMEs in the main don't have accountants, lawyers and dedicated HR staff on their payroll. I know that the small businesses I had ownership in certainly didn't. It was simply unaffordable, so my business partners or I would take on many of these roles as part of our responsibilities. Every minute spent on what in many cases was simply overreach and unnecessary red tape was a minute not working on our business to increase productivity and profitability. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Good governments understand that business requires affordable and reliable energy, which currently they simply do not enjoy under this Labor government. A classic example of this is Bongaree Hot Bread on beautiful Bribie Island in the electorate of Longman that I serve. When I visited them I noticed their shelves were devoid of bread at a reasonably early hour of the day. Always the optimist, I made the comment, 'Sold out of bread already, Mick?' The reply was: 'We don't make hot bread anymore, Terry, because our electricity bills increased by $12,000 in the past year. So it's no longer viable. We just now make a few speciality sourdough loaves on the weekends.' The name of the business is Bongaree Hot Bread. Maybe they should change their name to 'Bongaree No Bread' under this Labor government!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The new IR contracting laws state that if a contractor is doing business primarily for one business it is, in this Labor government's eyes, an employee. An owner of a carpet business, who for years has been contracting carpet layers to install the products he sells, asked me, 'How would I know how many other businesses my contractors work for, and what percentage I am of their business?' To find out would be dependent on him meeting them—more time out of his day—and then relying on them to be (1) truthful and (2) that this percentage would remain steady, which is not reality. His business demands rise and fall, as do other businesses', which, of course, would affect the percentage that he uses their services. Again, this is interference from the government into an area that was just going along nicely. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We now have data that shows that 43 per cent of SMEs in Australia are unprofitable—that is almost half, which is alarming; 20 per cent of SMEs are struggling to pay their energy bills on time; 45 per cent are concerned that they may not be able to pay them in the future; and just 22 per cent are feeling more optimistic about their future than 12 months ago, compared with 49 per cent—over the same period—who are feeling less optimistic about their future. They are screaming for more certainty around the investment-inspiring instant asset write-off program and want to see more incentives to encourage tech adoption to support the day-to-day running of their businesses. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Small and medium businesses feel abandoned and neglected by this Labor government. Sadly, 45 per cent have considered leaving or closing their business in the past 12 months, which, unsurprisingly, is very close to the figure of 43 per cent of businesses that are unprofitable. Why would you risk everything to make a loss? At the next election, Australians need to vote for the coalition—the party that supports small business and will get us back on track. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="278522" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:00</span>):  Macnamara is home to some outstanding small businesses. In fact, some of the best small businesses in our country are in my electorate, whether at the markets, on high streets, or in community-run cafes. On one end of the electorate we have the Caulfield Village shopping precinct. There's Elsternwick Village on Glen Huntly Road, Carlisle Street in east St Kilda, and Acland Street and Fitzroy Street in St Kilda. And Middle Park has wonderful little shops. In Albert Park there are brilliant high streets, such as Victoria Avenue, with great boutique shopping as well as cafes. In Port Melbourne there is the iconic Bay Street, and, up and down Southbank and South Melbourne, Clarendon Street. In so many pockets around Southbank there are small businesses where you can get literally anything you could possibly want. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we are bringing back into Macnamara Chapel Street in Windsor. I personally am very happy about Windsor coming back into Macnamara, after we briefly gave Windsor to the excellent member for Higgins for some short-term care and representation. We're bringing them back to Macnamara, and I'm very pleased about it. Not only is the community of Windsor so wonderful, so multicultural and so vibrant but also there are so many outstanding small businesses in Windsor. They've got so many great options where you can go and enjoy your free time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing about these small businesses and these little villages in Macnamara is that, when you ask people about what the great things are about living in our area, in our community, they don't just mention the schools and the different recreational facilities that we have around there; they mention the people behind the small businesses. They mention the people who make up our community businesses that have been there for generations—for decades. They mention the fact that each of these small businesses is a part of what makes our community so wonderful. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is really hard right now, especially as a retailer. The economics of being a small business is really hard. If you're in a high street in Melbourne right now, it can cost you somewhere between $70,000 and $100,000 for a 70- or 100-square-metre retail outlet. When you add staff on top of that, you're talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars of outlay before you even make any income. These small businesses on our high streets have to have $700,000 worth of revenue before they become viable, and it is really challenging for a lot of businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, the retail market is really stretched and the retail sector is really stretched. But what keeps them going is our community, and they keep our community going. They are really valuable and we need to support them in every way we can. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another model that's happening in our local community in South Melbourne is the South Melbourne Market. This is a modified retail model with smaller market stalls. The overall market is managed by the city of Port Phillip. With obviously a high amount of foot traffic they are really successful businesses. Some of these businesses have been there for decades, and they have really good relationships with the council. In fact, I even took the Minister for Small Business to the South Melbourne Market recently to show off some of our fantastic small businesses that are operating in South Melbourne. The first one we stopped into was Georgie's Harvest, a potato store. The minister was talking about Tasmanian potatoes—which I had to admit isn't my level of speciality! But I was very happy that all these things and some of the best food in the country are available in the South Melbourne Market.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This goes on top of some of the work we're doing to try and support small businesses. Obviously we're extending the $20,000 instant asset write-off. We have also given small businesses $325 for energy bill relief, which builds on top of the $650 rebate provided last financial year, which is almost $1,000 for energy bill support. I'll note that the coalition likes to talk a big game but opposed both of those measures—almost $1,000 to help small businesses with their energy costs. Nonetheless, I'm always pleased to stand up and talk about the small businesses that make our community vibrant, small businesses that are run by wonderful members of our local community and small businesses that make Macnamara the best electorate in the country.</span>

Like many in parliament, small businesses are the heart of my community, but in a community like mine with regional and rural parts, it's even more important. I was lucky enough to spend 15 years in business working with small businesses prior to my time in politics. One of the most important reasons we need strong small businesses and family businesses in our community is that strong family and small businesses mean a strong community. </span>

There is always one thing you notice at all of those grounds, outside of that strong community spirit. It's all the signs around the sides of the grounds. I always say I have seen lots of IGA independent supermarket signs. Deputy Speaker, I'm sure you'd see lots of Foodland signs in South Australia. I've yet to see a Woolworths or Coles sign sponsoring a local sports club. That's why we need to support small business. </span>

Just one piece of legislation, which I had the opportunity to speak on about four weeks ago, is all the Minister for Small Business has brought to this House. The best business gets is the important asset write-off of $20,000, which is down on what the coalition offered during the last term of government. The coalition committed to extending it to $30,000 in perpetuity to give businesses that certainty.</span>

They are giving $370 back, and that's going to solve the problem. But I do want to talk about the real world impact of this. We can sit here and debate this while member after member from those opposite—I know they have to do it—runs through the talking points given to them by the Treasurer. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:10</span>):  According to the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, over 97 per cent of all Australian businesses are classified as small businesses. There are over 2.5 million of them, many of them sole traders, and each of them supports up to 19 employees, making up 42 per cent of the workforce. These were the people I looked after when I was a lawyer, and I've always respected their courage and their have-a-go attitude when representing them as an MP. These are the people who make our morning coffee. They submit our tax returns, they bake our bread, they give legal advice and they even groom our dogs—a special call-out to those on the weekend that looked after my dogs, Dash and Henry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The variety of things they do is endless. One thing they all have in common is that they are the lifeblood of our communities. They provide local jobs and they support local schools and community groups. We all benefit from their hard work, as does the Australian economy. Small businesses contributed nearly $590 billion of value in 2022-23, about 33 per cent of our GDP. Small businesses do better when Australians have more dollars in their pockets. That's why we gave them all a pay cut to spend in their local small businesses. Sadly, the coalition opposed that, unbelievably—a slap in the face for small businesses. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no denying that small businesses have been doing it tough during this cost-of-living crisis that was kicked off by the coalition. That's why the Albanese Labor government is providing supports—because we know the importance of small business. This year's budget included a range of measures, valued at $640 million and targeted at easing the pressures on small business. We extended the $20,000 instant asset write-off for small businesses by 12 months. Small businesses with an annual turnover of less than $10 million can deduct eligible assets until 30 June 2025. This direct and targeted measure provides cashflow support, simplification benefits and eases financial pressures. It's equivalent to an estimated $290 million of support each year for two years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We gave pay rises and tax cuts because we know that cashflow is crucial to the success of small businesses. We've improved payment times, directing over $33 million towards reforms that assist this, including identifying big businesses that do not pay small businesses within the agreed terms, as well as enhanced powers for the regulator. It will all be transparent, with a dashboard that makes payment-time data more accessible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've provided more support in the form of energy bill relief. This meant $325 off energy bills for one million eligible small businesses and comes on top of the $650 rebate that was provided last financial year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also supporting small businesses to strengthen their defences against cybercrime. Amazingly, 43 per cent of cybercrime targets are small businesses, often resulting in financial loss and mental and physical stress on the small number of owners and staff. The Australian Signals Directorate reported that the average cost of a cybercrime incident involving a small business was $46,000. It's no surprise that these owners describe cyberattacks and scams as one of the biggest challenges they face. That's why I'm glad we've actually started to see a decrease in this—thanks to the Cyber Wardens, which is the free, online cybersecurity training program set up to help protect small businesses from the threat of attacks, and the Small Business Cyber Resilience Service, which was launched recently by the Minister for Small Business. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also made some big changes to the Commonwealth Procurement Rules to make it possible for small businesses to benefit from the $75 billion in contracts that is spent every year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These measures all sit within that bigger picture of supports being driven by the Minister for Small Business, who is holding regular meetings with small-business ministers and ensuring that all levels of government are collaborating on the new National Small Business Strategy. A federation can be a curse, especially for small businesses that want to go big.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is further support for small-business owners with our $26 million program for Fremantle health and financial counselling support. Small businesses will also benefit from another Albanese Labor government initiative that is helping Australians with the cost-of-living crisis and positioning us for the future. These include reforms that bolster employment opportunities, such as fee-free TAFE, cheaper child care and expanded paid parental leave, with one of the No. 1 concerns of my businesses—admittedly, they're not all small: manufacturing and the like—being that they need trained staff. They need warm bodies at the moment; they'll take anyone off the street, almost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor government values the economic and social contribution of the small business sector and will always back these hardworking business owners every step of the way. I still admire their ticker and courage for having a go.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:15</span>):  I've sat and listened to many of the speakers on this side and on the other side of the floor talking about how important businesses are—that they're the backbone of our communities. The truth is, in regional and rural areas, they are. They put the food on the table for our mums and dads. They put the money through the economy. If not for them, we would not have our smaller regional and rural communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've heard people talk about 'real people'. Well, can I give you some real examples of how tough it is out there for people in regional and rural Australia—firstly, Wicked Elf Beer. Wicked Elf was a brewery in Port Macquarie. It had been there for about 12 years. They closed this year because their electricity bill was higher than their rent. They had a warehouse, a place 10 times the size of this room here. They had invested tens of millions of dollars into that business over the dozen years that they operated. But because of this government's policies, they saw their power prices increase by more than 150 per cent, and they had to close down. So they sacked people; they lost jobs. And part of Port Macquarie lost a community that had been established there for many years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is the Dorrigo hotel. The owner there got in contact with me and said: 'Pat, I just got my forecast for contract for the next year. It has gone up by $25,000.' Now, Dorrigo, if you don't know it, is a small country town. Tourists come in and out. The Dorrigo hotel is a small pub. So, that's somebody's wage in Dorrigo. It's a lower socioeconomic area. Where are they going to find the money to pay that additional $25,000? Either they're going to have to put somebody off, and the boss will have to get on the taps, or they'll have to put the prices up, which then affects the community of Dorrigo and surrounds. And people are doing it tough. The farmers around there are doing it tough, because their electricity prices have gone through the roof. The cost of living has gone through the roof. Gas prices are up by over 30 per cent. And this is all because of this government's policies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor members over there are speaking out of both sides of their mouths saying how much they support local businesses, yet they are silent on these cost increases. Not one member has talked about the Prime Minister's promise to reduce bills by $275: 'Oh, no: we've reduced it by $300'—after the subsidy, because prices have gone up by, on average, $1,000. It's smoke and mirrors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If Labor indeed supported small businesses, they wouldn't have tied small businesses up in knots by, for example, legislating to have a union member be able to come into your business on a suspicion that you may not be paying your workers correctly—a suspicion. At least in my 12 years in the Police Force, it was a reasonable suspicion. You had to hold a reasonable suspicion to go and get a warrant, and then you had to go in front of a judge and plead your case: 'I want to enter this person's personal home or this person's business. I have to have reasonable grounds, and a judge has to agree with those reasonable grounds.' Nup: 'I'm a union member. I have a suspicion. So I am coming in. I don't need anyone else's permission. I'm coming in to hammer you.' These mum-and-dad small businesses don't have the ability to go and get lawyers or people to sit with the union member for days at a time. They have to go through this by themselves. And what happens there?</span>

                  <a href="299174" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAXALE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:20</span>):  I stand as a member that's been involved with a small business all my life, with regard to the comment from the former member there. I know from experience that small businesses are the beating heart of Australia's economy and the backbone of our local communities: 2½ million small businesses across the country employ more than five million Australians, contributing over $500 billion annually to our economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Bennelong, just like across the country, small businesses bring people to our town centres and are a real part of our community. They create jobs for local families, they sponsor our community sports clubs and they help make our high streets thriving, diverse and places we all want to go, see and visit. Across Bennelong, there are hundreds of small businesses employing countless locals, each contributing to the fabric of our community. Whether it's the family that has owned a shop for generations or that new entrepreneur taking their first steps in business, our small businesses are at the heart of what makes Bennelong such a dynamic and connected community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As their representative, someone with a long and proud history in small business, I'm pleased to be a part of a government that values small businesses and their owners. I understand the unique challenges of small business, and I'm committed to ensuring that the government delivers support they need to thrive, not only in Bennelong but across the nation. It's not about headlines or broad economic platitudes; our support is about addressing the real issues that confront small-business owners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that they're doing it tough right now. Rising costs, sticky inflation, supply chain disruptions and evolving consumer habits have created new pressures for business owners, many of whom are still recovering from the economic shock waves of the pandemic. These challenges are real, and they are significant. That's why our government is stepping up to provide practical and targeted support that helps small businesses not just to weather the storm but to build for the future. Our approach prioritises resilience, innovation and fairness, ensuring that small-business owners have the tools they need to thrive. We do that in a number of ways.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've extended the $20,000 instant asset write-off until June 2025, which is an initiative that allows businesses to immediately deduct the cost of equipment and tools, freeing up cash flow and enabling them to grow. In Bennelong, this means that local cafes can upgrade their equipment, tradies can invest in better tools and startups can purchase the technology they need to compete and to grow. These investments ripple through our local economy whilst creating jobs and opportunities for our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also understand the burden of rising electricity costs. That's why we've delivered targeted energy bill relief to nearly one million small businesses: $325 this financial year and $650 the year before that. That reflects our commitment to easing cost-of-living pressures where we can. We've also rolled out really important efficiency grants to small and medium businesses to invest in renewable energy technology. Systems that help use less power for refrigeration and allow businesses to invest in solar and battery technology were rolled out and were incredibly successful, because we want businesses to have confidence in investing in this new technology to cut their bills. This is all about resilience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, we've invested $60 million in cybersecurity and digital transformation programs. You just need to look at our recent announcement on banning debit payment surcharges, made off the back of the fee-free digital campaign I ran, just to see how much small businesses matter to this government. From day one, I acknowledged that small business costs also need to be addressed alongside the need of consumers to have a fee-free digital option at the checkout. It was so great, then, to hear both the Prime Minister and Treasurer acknowledge this exact view in their October announcement. They said that surcharging can only be addressed if the RBA addresses the cost to small business, because we know that digital payment costs are severe for small businesses and are unfairly targeted at small businesses. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is much more to be said about how this government is supporting them—too much to list in one five-minute speech. But I just want to say this to local businesses in Bennelong: I spent my whole life in and around small business. I know how great they can be and I know the strain that they can place on owners and their families. In my time as an elected official and now in this place, I have done all I can to ensure small businesses' perspectives are aired in government and around decision-makers, and that's something I will continue to do.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The statistics concerning type 1 diabetes are confronting. Today there are over 130,000 Australians living with it. Every year around 3,000 children and adults are newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes—about eight people per day. In 2021 around 13,200 children and young adults aged zero to 19 were living with type 1 diabetes, and it's great to see some of them in the chamber here today. In 2023 these numbers translated to around 19,000 years of healthy life lost. However, tomorrow and today our focus will not be on statistics; our focus will be on the 106 children with type 1 diabetes and their families who will be visiting Parliament House for the Kids in the House event, kids like Charlotte and her dad, David, who I met previously thanks to the JDRF. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been involved with the Parliamentary Friends for the Prevention of Diabetes for my entire time in politics and am currently co-chair with the indefatigable member for Grey, Rowan Ramsey. During this time, I've benefited from a close working relationship with JDRF and learnt about the significant research carried out by the Type 1 Diabetes Clinical Research Network. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">JDRF is focused on research, including numerous clinical trials, that addresses two key pillars: finding a cure and improving the day-to-day lives of people with type 1 diabetes. The researchers want to discover how to prevent the condition, to find out what's causing it and to investigate how to stop it developing. What JDRF calls 'precision research' focuses on the differences in presentation of type 1 diabetes and subsequently how to tailor treatment to individuals, and their 'progress research' is aimed at accelerating the search for a cure. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past year, I've had an additional focus for my work: temporary membership of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health, Aged Care and Support for its inquiry into diabetes in Australia. This year-long inquiry had nearly 500 submissions and met with stakeholders all around the country. The resulting report on the state of diabetes mellitus in Australia in 2024 recommended the continuation of funding for type 1 diabetes research and clinical trials. I think all in this place, particularly the member for McNamara, would fully support that. The Type 1 Diabetes Clinical Research Network has received over $70 million in funding since 2010. Minister Butler provided a further $6.5 million in this year's budget, reinforcing the funding from the National Health and Medical Research Council and the Medical Research Future Fund. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For people living with type 1 diabetes, the primary concern is, of course, the day-to-day management of the condition. When young Charlotte, hiding down the back there, visited my office, she was proud to show me her continuous glucose monitor. Continuous glucose monitors make the management of type 1 diabetes a little easier. They provide up-to-the-minute analysis of glucose levels, enabling the timely management of glucose highs and lows, leading to fewer low blood glucose emergencies. In June this year, I was one of a group of parliamentarians who wore a continuous glucose monitor for two weeks. I've changed my diet because of that. Who knew that sushi was so bad for you? This experiment was a great one to be involved with. I know people who use CGMs find them to be gamechangers, so I'm happy that the government has subsidised them. We're also committed to the expansion of the eligibility criteria for the separate insulin pump program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to touch on the advocacy work of JDRF. It's why the indefatigable Charlotte is here in Canberra this week, to link politicians with people with a lived experience. It's always powerful to hear directly from those affected, like Charlotte, for their part. JDRF advocates find purpose and positivity through speaking out for their community and pushing their research agenda. Thank you. Today and tomorrow is all about hope for the future; it's about our commitment to further research that makes it easier to manage type 1 diabetes on a daily basis, and it's about a firm focus on working together for a cure.</span>

I extend a warm welcome to all the children and families coming to events and look forward to meeting many of you over today and tomorrow. Sadly, I think this will be my last JDRF event, so thank you for all the great work that you do, and I will follow from a distance outside the chamber.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:31</span>):  The motion is seconded. To the JDRF kids and the Kids in the House program, I've got to say, that in the 17 years I've been here, I think this is the most effective lobbying campaign we've seen. Congratulations JDRF and Mike Wilson on this program. All those blue shirts and those little kids actually tear at your heartstrings, because you know what diabetes is doing to them but also to their families and how difficult it is to cope with on every level. Welcome to Parliament House, and thank you, member for Morton, for putting this motion up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Morton and I have become very firm friends after our 17 years together in parliament. We're leaving at the same time, and I'm looking to hand over the reins of the coalition's side of being the co-chair of—I don't actually call us the Friends of Diabetes. I say we're the enemies of diabetes in this place, and long may that tag live! The member for Lindsay, alongside me here, has her own personal story about diabetes. I look forward to this group. It is the longest-serving group—the first friendship group formed in this place and the longest surviving. What I'd like to see is the group abandoned because we've solved all the problems with diabetes, but I suspect that's a little way away yet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a special mention for Fletcher Buchanan, who's momentarily distracted, and his mum, Alex. His dad, Luke, can't be here today. He's a principal. Oh, there we go—actually, there's an update. Welcome. All of you have your own personal story. Fletcher is only two years old. I went down to Yorketown two or three weeks ago to introduce myself to him, and he's a delightful young fellow who is looking forward to taking advantage of the advances in the treatment of diabetes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I think back over what we've achieved over the 17 years in parliament, there weren't any constant glucose monitors around, then. They didn't link up to pumps. That has made such a vital change to people with diabetes, but we're not happy. We want a cure. That's the answer. We can't do that unless we keep up on the scientific front. I normally start my speeches about diabetes by saying it's the leading cause of heart disease, the leading cause of blindness and the leading cause of amputation. I should add that it's also one of the leading causes of kidney disease, dementia, stroke, mental stress, cancer and liver disease. There are very good reasons for Australia to make a concerted effort to play its part in the international scene to see this cursed disease off, quite frankly. None of you choose to have it. You just have to wear it and live with it. So thank you so much for your stoicism. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to make a special mention of Mike Wilson OAM, who has led this organisation for 20 years. You stepped down mid-year, but it's good to see you back in here, Mike. I think we were due to have lunch today somewhere, but the cafe wasn't open or something. We look forward to working with Sydney in your place. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many things about diabetes. It's not just type 1, of course; there is type 2 diabetes as well. Sadly, I have reported to this House many times that the electorate of Grey is the world champion or the Australian champion when it comes to the incidence of diabetes full stop. There are 1.4 million Australians diagnosed with diabetes, and type 2 diabetes is creating havoc. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we need to keep going on all those fronts. I think it less likely that we will find a cure for type 2, but I think we will continue to find better and better treatments. But I do think the future is bright from the point of view of finding that long-term cure. I don't know who the smart lady or smart man will be that will suddenly say, 'Eureka, we've got the answer here!' Maybe it will happen incrementally. But I do know that in this place, in this parliament, that both sides of parliament and the crossbenches—all of us—are united in the cause of trying to support juvenile diabetes research. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I back the calls from the member for Moreton, that we need to see a continuation of that funding—I think you're looking for $30 million at the moment. It originally came from Greg Hunt. There was an extension last year. We need it to be locked into the budget on an ongoing basis until it's done. </span>

I acknowledge the 106 advocates for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, JDRF, and the advocates in the chamber this afternoon. It is a privilege to recognise this significant occasion as we unite to advocate for a cause that touches the lives of more than 130,000 Australians living with type 1 diabetes. This includes my beautiful grandson, who was diagnosed at age 10. His treatments continue to be monitored and amended with his growth, so this is very close to my heart. I am very proud to wear the blue JDRF T-shirt. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have joined my grandson on JDRF walks, and would like to give a special shout-out to the amazing WA team of Dakota Edmiston, Louise and Sabine Murray, Scott and Digby Price, and also<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>to the hardworking Mel Eveille and Sydney Yovic for their excellent work and their Kids in the House initiative. Together with their families, these advocates have travelled from around the nation to share their stories to make a compelling case for the Type 1 Diabetes Clinical Research Network. I want to commend each and every one of you for your unwavering dedication and tireless efforts in working with members and senators across Australia. Your advocacy has not gone unnoticed. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The research conducted has provided hope—a beacon in what can often feel like a daunting journey. The advances made through this research are not just numbers or statistics; they represent real lives, real families and real futures that are being transformed through science and innovation. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thursday 14 November marked World Diabetes Day—a day when a passionate and articulate community raised awareness about diabetes and stressed its advocacy for research that will lead to better treatments, early detection methods and ultimately a cure. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to acknowledge the valuable work in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health, Aged Care and Sport. Under the leadership of the member for Macarthur, this committee has conducted an inquiry into diabetes that yielded bipartisan recommendations. These recommendations focus on critical areas such as research, early detection and prevention strategies, and expanding access to essential diabetes technologies. The commitment shown by this committee reflects a growing recognition that addressing type 1 diabetes is not just a health issue; it is an absolute imperative for our society. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the advocates who have travelled great distances to be here today: your courage in sharing your personal stories is inspiring. Each narrative adds depth to our understanding and reinforces the importance of collective advocacy efforts. You are not just representatives of your own experience; you embody the hopes and dreams of countless others affected by this condition. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We understand that research holds the key to unlocking new possibilities for those living with type 1 diabetes. It is through continued investment in research that we can pave the way for innovative treatments that will enhance the quality of life throughout your life, and your message has been heard loud and clear.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Diabetes Australia has expressed strong support for the recent federal budget measures that will significantly benefit individuals who are living with type 1 diabetes. Key highlights include investment of $3.7 million to subsidise insulin pumps for financially disadvantaged Australians under the age of 21. This initiative aims to enhance access to vital diabetes management technologies to ensure that young people can effectively manage their condition without facing financial hardship. Additionally, the budget allocates $6.5 million to support the type 1 diabetes clinical research network, facilitating a number of research projects that are crucial for advancing treatment options and improving health outcomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government budget provisions represents a significant commitment to supporting Australians with type 1 diabetes, addressing both immediate needs and long-term health outcomes to enhance access to essential medical devices and research funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing: let us remember that our fight is far from over. The path ahead may be challenging, but together with advocates, families and researchers we can forge a future where diabetes no longer dictates the lives of those affected by it. Thank you once again for being here today. It's so incredibly important. Thank you for your advocacy and for your unwavering commitment to making a difference in the lives of those living with type 1 diabetes. Together we can create lasting change. It's so important, and it needs to be done. The sight of blue T-shirts with JDRF on them is absolutely heartwarming, and it's great to see each and every one of you. Thank you so much.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs McINTOSH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:41</span>):  There'll be 106 young people with type 1 diabetes in parliament tomorrow for JDRF Kids in the House—and here today. That's 106 young people and their families who have a harrowing story of being everyday kids one day and on a roller-coaster that never ends the next. That is the story of type 1 diabetes. Every family that will be here tomorrow wishes medical research had progressed enough so that their child did not end up in hospital on diagnosis and that it could be prevented.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On diagnosis, my son Byron was rushed to hospital with blood like syrup, as we were told, and blood sugars above 40. He had been training and studying hard, which made us think it was just fatigue. Hindsight tells us differently. There were so many factors that led us there, and every family has many factors going on in their lives that lead to their own dramatic story. There are 1,161 dramatic stories in Lindsay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More than that, we wish for a cure. The great Swans athlete Patty McCartin said to me right here in parliament last week that type 1 is the most 'unknown known' disease in the world. So many people still don't know what type 1 is, and many of the young people who are coming into this House have probably met someone who has asked them, 'Do you have too much sugar?' Or perhaps they have said to them, 'You don't look like someone who has diabetes.' They probably also didn't want everyone to know they had type 1 at first, because of the stigma. Then, somewhere along the way, that feeling of wanting to hide type 1 changed, and they become type 1 advocates, and now they want the whole country to know—and we're listening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We listened during the House of Representatives Health Committee inquiry into diabetes—Dr Freelander is here in the chamber—where we made a number of recommendations related to type 1. We recommended that subsidised access to continuous glucose monitors be further expanded and, in the first instance, all access limitations, including age, in relation to patients with type 1 diabetes be removed. We recommended that the government explore expanding subsidised access to insulin pumps for all Australians with type 1 diabetes, as well as increased funding for type 1 diabetes research and clinical trials, and an increase in diabetes educators; there was only one looking after adults in Nepean Hospital when Byron was diagnosed. And we made a recommendation around better mental health support for people with type 1 and also recommended that the government undertake a review of the price and choice of insulin pumps in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm so proud that we ensured that type 1 was heavily on the agenda and made those recommendations. Lindsay's very own JDRF advocate, Emily Klimek, who's here today, was the very first witness who gave evidence at the inquiry. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I am speaking on behalf of the 130,000 with type 1 and also the eight more that will be diagnosed tomorrow. I think T1D is very misunderstood, and it absolutely sucks having it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Emily is one of the advocates here in parliament this week, and I couldn't be prouder as her local MP. It is Emily's advocacy—along with that of her mum, Julie—for choice in pumps that was really important as we went through the diabetes inquiry. Kids with type 1 shouldn't be forced onto only one type of device. Everyone's body is different, everyone's needs is different, and choice is paramount for the successful management of type 1 and keeping blood sugars under control. Access to technology—the right technology for the individual—is the difference between a long and healthy life and one that might be filled with complications. It can be the difference between life and death because, as we know with type 1, the high blood sugars can give you long-term complications and the lows can kill you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this week, we are not going to be down. This week is about reminding all the Kids in the House that they can do anything. I'm super proud that my son, Byron, who was diagnosed two years ago, has since represented Australian judo. He has changed the International Judo Federation rules—when the rules said you couldn't wear a device on the mat—so that kids all across the world with type 1 can now step onto a judo mat with a CGM or a pump. Tomorrow, he will also be in the House, giving presentations to families and reminding the kids that they can do and be anything they want. They can quite literally climb Mount Everest. I wish you all the luck over the next couple of days.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265979" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr FREELANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:46</span>):  I'm a cranky, old paediatrician, and I have seen many kids with diabetes in my time, but I just want to tell you all—and Byron, as well—just how important your advocacy is. I've seen dramatic changes in diabetes management in the half a century that I have been working as a doctor and as a paediatrician, in particular. My very good friend, Helen Woodhead, who is a paediatric endocrinologist and a diabetic herself, has really changed the face of paediatric diabetes in Australia. The advocacy that you are giving us is remarkable. Everyone knows the blue T-shirts; everyone knows the JDRF, and you're changing the narrative.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know from our diabetes inquiry that the best practice these days is a closed-loop, artificial pancreas type system with better control, fewer side effects and fewer complications. We are aiming to get this for everyone who is eligible, but it takes time, effort, money and commitment from government—and our government is committed to this. But we need to make sure that that treatment is available not just in the inner cities but all around Australia, in rural and regional areas and remote areas as well. We need better Indigenous trained health workers who can manage type 1 diabetes in their communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What you are doing is spreading your message all around the country, and it is just so important. We've seen how important not just education but resources are. We need diabetes educators in all areas, not just in the major teaching hospitals. We need people to be able to access diabetes educators and podiatrists and ophthalmologists and a whole range of people who can help manage their diabetes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some really exciting things happening in type 1 diabetes with prevention and treatment before diagnosis. We know that diagnosis can sometimes be difficult—some people struggle to get a diagnosis. Our GPs, our health professionals, need to be better trained in diabetes, and our government is committed to this, to making sure that people can get early diagnosis—in fact, diagnosis or potential diagnosis before presentation with symptoms. This is very important. We know there are some really exciting things happening with the genetics of diabetes, and we hope one day there will be a world where people with diabetes will not have to inject themselves, where they will have lives without the need for devices et cetera.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that will come. I've seen such dramatic changes in my time as a paediatrician, from the use of multiple injections a day of beef and pork insulin to human insulin and the closed-loop system. It is making a dramatic difference. We now know that people with diabetes can do the things that everyone else can do. We've seen first-grade footballers, cricketers and people like Byron competing at the highest level with type 1 diabetes. The use of a closed-loop system has been dramatic. As I've said, there are other rapid advances happening in the immunology and genetics of diabetes, and our government is committed to making sure that these advances are available to all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also have particular interest in countries around us—our near neighbours in the South Pacific. We need to make sure they have the resources to manage diabetes as well. Last year, on our trip to New Guinea, we saw there were difficulties in getting access to treatment for type 1 diabetes—in the highlands of New Guinea, in particular—and we must make sure that our Pacific neighbours have the potential to treat type 1 diabetes like we have been doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government is also looking at how we can deliver long-term management for people in rural areas so that they don't have to travel to different level 3 centres for management of their diabetes. We are looking at improved research into diabetes and longer research programs, lasting years rather than one or two years. This is very important if we are going to look to the future with forward-facing management for type 1 diabetes. JDRF has been very important in getting that message around the parliament and to people who can influence government policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very proud of our diabetes report that we completed last year with the help of the member for Lindsay, the member for Kooyong and many other of our parliamentarians. We hope that this will help provide solutions for the future. Thank you for everything that you do. You are making a huge difference in our parliament for people with type 1 diabetes and for those in the future. I thank you so much for your efforts and I'm really looking forward to hearing your stories tomorrow about type 1 diabetes and your progress. Thank you.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265980" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SHARKIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:51</span>):  First of all, welcome everybody who's here from JDRF. Many of your faces look very familiar to me. Thank you for being so attentive during the speeches. That has been a hard slog. You will be thankful to know that I am the last speaker on the JDRF motion, and then you can relax and do other things. But it really is a delight to have you here. I would echo many of the other members' words. The advocacy that the JDRF network does, in sharing your stories and spending time with members of parliament, is very powerful. Stories are very powerful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the member for Moreton, who put forward this motion, because it is so incredibly important. I know that kids in the House—I've seen many white trench coats over the years. Do you have the white trench coats here? Excellent. Very good. It's spectacular to see. Over the years in my electorate, I have met with many children and young people who are living with type 1 diabetes and I have heard their stories. That has been a real driver for me as the federal member to then, over the years, go and advocate to various health ministers about the needs of people who are living with type 1 diabetes, what we can do to make life better for them and, as the member for Grey said, not give up until we find a cure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to mention a family from my electorate of Mayo: Dwayne, his wife, Belinda, and their gorgeous daughter Emily. I met Emily, who is living with type 1 diabetes, around her second birthday. She was about 2½, and that was in July 2021. I recently met with Emily again, and now she's six years of age. She is just doing so fabulously well. She's loving school and loving life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Emily's story and stories like hers are what made me go and meet with Greg Hunt, the former health minister, who was incredibly supportive of making sure that we could make constant glucose monitoring affordable. To me, it was a game changer when we were able to get that, particularly for children, and then have it expanded. At that time, the NDSS subsidy for constant glucose monitoring was only available to young children and there was a real concern when people aged out about what that affordability would look like. I was pleased to see that the then minister and the then government said that they would be looking to make it accessible for everyone. When Labor was in opposition, they agreed to that, and now we have that as policy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's powerful. Your work did that, not us in this place. It's your work and advocacy that made that happen. As Emily's father said to me:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">'Affordable access to diabetes technology will truly change lives. Type 1 diabetes is a challenging and relentless lifelong disease that requires constant management. Committing funds to CGMs and technologies will positively impact thousands of Australians in both the short and long term.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Macarthur mentioned, I too look forward to the government's response to the report of the Standing Committee on Health, Aged Care and Sport, ably chaired by that member. I note the member for Lindsay's great work in this space too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to make sure that we are constantly looking forward and working with you on new projects—that we don't ever give up. We have to make sure that there is research and funding, because that's how we're going to see change. We can't just assume it's not going to happen, and we can't, as a nation, just expect the rest of the world to do this lifting. In particular, I lend my support to recommendation 21, which is:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… that the Australian government takes steps to manage diabetes research efforts through the Australian Centre for Disease Control (CDC) by coordinating with the peak bodies such as JDRF and Diabetes Australia research priorities with an emphasis on equitable access and prevention … and considers increasing funding for Type 1 diabetes research and clinical trials. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank all of the people who are here today in the Chamber for coming to parliament, particularly at this busy time, as we're coming up to Christmas, and during this crazy week which is the last week of parliament. You will always be so very welcome here, and I look forward to joining you tomorrow. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier today in my constituency statement I shared excerpts of the views of Natimuk locals on the Victorian government's proposal to ban rock climbing on a large portion of Mount Arapiles, near Natimuk in my electorate of Mallee. Locals fear the ban spells the death of Natimuk, and tragically many that live there will now leave the area if the bans stand. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mount Arapiles is considered an international mecca for rock climbers. Some even profess a spiritual bond with the mountain. It is where rock climbers have developed techniques to protect the rock face that have been adopted throughout the world to preserve the surface for future generations. The Allan Labor government would have known this if they had consulted with the rock-climbing community. This is where the federal minister would do well to establish protocols on cultural heritage, so we don't see more public land in Australia locked up for the enjoyment, or even profit, of a select few. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:01</span>):  I am surprised this motion is before us here in the federal parliament. It is a matter that is entirely for the Victorian state government. It surprises me that we are debating this topic today. Sometimes you will have these debates in the leadup to a state election, where friendly fellow-travellers of a political party may try and use the floor of parliament to score a few points for their allies in their community, but we are not due for a state election in Victoria until November 2026. So it does surprise me that we are here today debating a matter that is entirely the responsibility of the Victorian government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it does give me an opportunity to talk about the great work the Commonwealth—the federal government—is doing for national and marine parks. After a wasted decade, the environment is back under Labor, and we are prioritising making sure we are doing our bit to protect our natural environment. You could say it was a wasted decade or that there were deliberate decisions made by the previous government to destroy our natural environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are working to protect more of our natural environment. Since coming to government, we have doubled the funding to better look after our Commonwealth national parks, including Kakadu and Uluru, after the Liberals—to be frank—let them fall apart. The parts the Commonwealth manage in national parks have been closed to visitors because they were unsafe. Roofs were coming off buildings, alarming crocodile warning signs were missing or broken. We, in government, have made sure we have corrected this through infrastructure grants and supporting the community to get these areas back to being safe for visitors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also added new areas to Kakadu National Park, extending the area of protection. It's not just Kakadu. We've tripled the size of the Macquarie Island Marine Park, the biggest act of conservation in 2023. We've quadrupled the size of the Heard and McDonald Islands Marine Reserve, the biggest contribution to ocean conservation on the planet this year. This is what our government, an Australian government, has done. These decisions now mean that Australia's protecting more oceans than any other country on Earth. We've also voted to ratify the High Seas Treaty, which helps protect seas and waters beyond our own. Our natural environment is so precious, and as the King himself said in an address here in this building, it is upon our generation as leaders to protect and support the environment for future generations and it is a moral duty to do so. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On cultural heritage: back in 2020, all of us remember the devastation and the tragedy of a 46,000-year-old Aboriginal sacred site being destroyed by a mining company. It was tragic and, sadly, legal. The Australian people were quietly outraged and appalled. And since then, all political parties have said that this tragedy should never be allowed to happen again. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were two parliamentary inquiries chaired by the Liberal member for Leichhardt. Both inquiries recommended updating the national laws to better protect First Nations heritage. Work on updating the national laws was started by the previous Liberal government and has been continued by this government. We are consulting carefully on updating cultural heritage laws.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As usual, the draft laws will be released for public comment. There will be the standard parliamentary inquiries, and everyone will be given the opportunity to have their say. This is about updating our existing national laws to make sure a tragedy like what we saw in 2020 doesn't happen again. Our goal is to have laws that better protect First Nations heritage whilst giving businesses, farmers and others more certainty, and we believe we can do both by working together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A final comment I wish to make is to remind members of the coalition, particularly Victorian members of the coalition, that this is the federal parliament, and we should really do our best to stay in our lane. The times we have to stand on our feet to debate matters that this parliament can address are limited, so let's focus on federal laws, federal changes and ways in which we can better support our environment at a federal level. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHESTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gippsland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:06</span>):  Every day in this place it becomes clearer and clearer that regional Australians are simply worse off under this spineless Labor government. I have noted before the remarkable similarities between the new, modern Labor Party and jellyfish. It's quite extraordinary. It is a scientific fact: jellyfish have no brains, no backbone, no heart and no stomach. When it comes to standing up to extremism in the Greens, standing up for working families, standing up for blue-collar workers and farmers, I have never seen a more gutless government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Old Labor members would not even recognise this blubbering mess of a political party that has completely lost its spine when it comes to regional Australians. Now, I'm afraid that the Labor Party—the new, modern Labor Party—foolishly believes that you can placate the extremists and the activists, but I need to let them know and warn them: they will never be satisfied and they are always going to come back for more. They have no concept of practical environmental management. Zealotry and extremism have become their modus operandi at the expense of regional jobs, our way of life and our culture. Yes, European Australians, non-Indigenous Australians, have culture as well. That should be respected and recognised when we make laws in this place or in other places around the country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we're seeing now is the modern Labor Party selling out blue collar workers for Greens preferences right across the nation. If you are a farmer or a miner or if you like camping, fishing, hunting, collecting firewood, occasionally betting on a horserace or generally enjoying a free life outdoors, Labor and the Greens simply don't like you. Between them, they have combined to ban rock climbing at Mount Arapiles, ban live sheep exports, ban the hardwood timber industry in Victoria, ban irrigated agriculture in many areas, ban firewood collection, ban new gas connections, ban grazing in the high country and ban commercial fishing, and they also want to ban duck shooting and horseracing. Labor keeps wanting to create more national parks across our country, both at land and at sea, banning more activities in rural and regional Australia, when they don't even look after the national parks they've got today. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the motion moved by the member for Mallee, it's just the latest example of an all-or-nothing approach by the Labor Greens movement. Mount Arapiles, as we have just heard from the member for Mallee, offers world-class climbing, and it's part of the attraction, for skilled health workers in this case, to live and work in the region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Decisions made in this parliament and other parliaments have consequences, and what we are seeing now is that people who want to enjoy that rural way of life, to enjoy Mount Arapiles and all it offers, will leave the region because of a decision made by the Labor Party, backed by the Greens. And not a single member of this place ever stands up and shows the spine to contest this extremism in the green movement. We will see more of this if the Labor Greens return to government next year in this place. Instead of a balanced approach, which allows for a multi-use of land and sea resources, they adopt this 'lock it up and leave it' mentality, and they couldn't care less about the impacts on the country people and their way of life. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have seen it firsthand in my seat of Gippsland over the last 12 months with the complete ban on the native hardwood timber industry. The skilled workforce and forest contractors needed in the next bushfire season won't be there because of this ban. My community will be left at the mercy of poorly maintained public forests. The state government is making no efforts to mitigate the risk and has just cut its workforce in both DEECA and Parks Victoria. What we need to see in our regional communities are the practical environmentalists: more boots and less suits. That's more boots on the ground doing the work, doing the fire prevention mitigation activities, and less suits in Melbourne and Canberra making excuses and putting in more green tape that prevents work from occurring in the first place. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So if we're going to have any bans in this place, perhaps we should ban the Labor Greens from banning anything else in regional Australia without first consulting with the community that's going to be adversely affected—affected socially, economically, environmentally and culturally. Deputy Speaker Archer, I know you come from a regional community, and I think you probably understand this as much as I do. Regional workers are tired of being told what jobs they can have and what they are not allowed to do on their weekends by these city-based Labor Green politicians who have no interest in ever living in our communities in the first place. Regional Australians will be better off when we get rid of this spineless government and stand up to the extremists in the Greens. </span>

                  <a href="210911" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TEHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:12</span>):  It gives me great pleasure to follow the member for Gippsland, and before him the member for Mallee, because the Victorian Labor government's decision is extraordinary. You would think that a state government that is broke and is about to go into official receivership would be doing everything it could, when it had an asset, to ensure that it got the balance right with the decisions it made. You'd think that, if there was a need to protect something for cultural heritage, you'd be able to do it in balance in a unique rock climbing part of the globe where people from overseas go their hundreds to rock climb. Yet the wherewithal of the Allan Labor government meant they did nothing of the sort. What they did was just say no without any consultation: 'We are going to close this unique area of rock climbing.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I love the Grampians, and one of the fantastic things I have been able to contribute is $10 million for the wonderful Grampians Peak Trail. I love the fact that people can explore the Grampians, but also do so in a very respectful way, knowing and understanding the cultural heritage of the place. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what has occurred with Mount Arapiles is nothing short of a disgrace. The Allan Labor government needs to have a good hard look at itself, because simply shutting something down without consultation, especially without consultation of the rock climbing industry, is a disaster. Now, you've got to remember that the rock climbing industry are not people who seek in any way not to understand the environment they are climbing on, not to understand the cultural heritage of the place, or not to want to work with the local Indigenous groups to make sure that they get the right balance that would respect those unique cultural heritage places but also enable rock climbing on one of the great rock climbing peaks in the world. People have built businesses around it. People have come to live in that area so they can climb Mount Arapiles. Yet what did the Allan Labor government do? Without consultation, they just shut it down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing that was the most damning, which showed you what an appalling decision it was, was when the environment minister, Steve Dimopoulos, went up to the area and did a radio interview on ABC. He was asked about the decision to close Mount Arapiles, and he'd done so little research on what had occurred that he couldn't even pronounce 'Mount Arapiles'. Now, if you're going to do something that impacts like that, at least have the decency to go up there, talk to the community, understand its importance and make sure you know, inside and out. what is taking place, instead of just going up there and basically treating the local community with complete and utter disrespect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The worst thing about this is that it sends a signal to the rest of the state of Victoria as to what could be next from this Victorian Labor state government. At the moment they're going through treaty negotiations. and once again we are getting no transparency about what is occurring there. There is no broad community consultation about what's going on. If what has happened at Mount Arapiles is any indication of what might happen with the broader negotiations, then we're going to see the rest of Victoria treated with complete and utter disrespect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, I 100 per cent back this motion from the member for Mallee. We need this reopened. We need the federal Labor government to step in and ask serious questions of the state Labor government and for the state Labor government to do proper consultation with the local community on this.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:17</span>):  As I've said in this House previously, I'm a proud former TAFE teacher and a mum of two apprentice chippies, and that's why I take every opportunity to champion TAFE and to celebrate the successes of our wonderful TAFE students.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last week I was thrilled to meet two inspiring young locals from my electorate as we welcomed home the Australian Skillaroos from the WorldSkills international competition in France. The competitions shines a light on TAFE students like Michael Bowen, an apprentice at QinetiQ Air Affairs in Nowra, who competed in the industrial mechanics event. It celebrates on the world stage the excellence and innovation of TAFE students like Michael stage. I was also thrilled to meet gold-medal-winning Skillaroo Jyothi Collins, who works at Georgies Fine Jewellery in Batemans Bay and was chosen as the competition's jewellery expert of the year. How good is that? These two students demonstrate just how learning at TAFE can change lives and put young people on a pathway to success. Whether our kids or grandkids want to become a tradie, a child carer, a nurse, a computer programmer or even a cybersecurity expert, TAFE provides that opportunity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this month I visited the Nowra TAFE campus with the Acting Prime Minister. We went into electrical and carpentry classes. We spoke with students and heard how fee-free TAFE is providing that bit of important financial relief and also allowing people to retrain. It's fantastic to see these classes booming in Nowra, and it was very reassuring to hear stories from the students about how and why they chose an apprenticeship and how fee-free TAFE is helping.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm really pleased to see that the TAFE certificate II in aeroskills is also fee free, encouraging local people to seek a career as an avionics maintainer to support defence industry jobs locally. Last month, I joined the federal Minister for Skills and Training to meet twins Najara and Harrisen, both first-year motor mechanic apprentices at Batemans Bay Automotive Repairs. The siblings travel to Nowra TAFE once a week and are looking forward to one day taking the helm of their family business. TAFE is providing them with the variety of skills needed to do just that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We met Robert Beattie, a huge supporter of young people and TAFE, who has supervised an incredible 45 apprentice carpenters at Beach House Stairs at Batemans Bay. We chatted to apprentices Nathan, Nicholas and Brendan about how TAFE is helping them build the skills needed to meet gaps in the workforce. Seventeen-year-old Nathan comes from a family of tradies and is loving getting hands-on experience. As a carpenter, he's confident he will always have work. Our plan to make fee-free TAFE permanent, with 100,000 free places each year from 2027, will help regional kids like Nathan, Harrisen and Najara.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More than 4,400 people in Gilmore have taken up fee-free TAFE, and I am extremely disappointed that the opposition leader will not support our fee-free TAFE bill. They are showing their absolute disregard for young people and families in regional areas and are completely out of touch with the needs of young Australians. It is reprehensible that the Liberals are refusing to allocate a dollar towards the thousands of hardworking Australians who are getting the skills they need for the jobs they want. The shadow minister for skills and training, Sussan Ley, labelled this government's skills and training policy as 'disastrous'. She said, 'Fee-free TAFE sounds good, but is it working?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, I have been on the ground talking with students and I have been on the ground talking to employers and apprentices, and I can tell you it is working. I have travelled from one end of my electorate to the other and listened to young people who are training at TAFE and listened to adults who are retraining and gaining new skills. I have been walking the streets of the villages and towns in Gilmore and talking to people who are reaping the real rewards of fee-free TAFE—young people like our Skillaroo Michael and apprentices Harrisen, Nathan and Najara. These are the people we are helping.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To answer Sussan Ley's question about whether it is working: yes, it is; our skills and training policy is most definitely working. I have just given a few examples of how it is working and how people of all ages are thriving in Gilmore because of TAFE. The Liberals have made it clear that they will scrap fee-free TAFE. As long as there is a Labor government, fee-free TAFE is here to stay.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:22</span>):  I would like to compliment and praise Jasmine Cecchini. She is a beauty therapist in Wagga Wagga, and her journey has been deeply rooted in family influence and personal ambition. She set out on this course when she was 19 years young, apprenticing in her mother's salon. This early immersion in the world of beauty therapy provided her with not only valuable hands-on experience but very much a strong foundation in the field.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She won a Medallion for Excellence at the WorldSkills Lyon 2024, in France. Her employer is Circa 1929, located in Fitzmaurice Street in the heart of Wagga Wagga. Her training institute was the Technical and Further Education New South Wales Wagga Wagga. She has shown remarkable dedication to her craft, completing her apprenticeship and, by the age of 21, winning gold at the WorldSkills Australia nationals.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst she has been very busy working and training, she has made certain that she has a good work-life balance. She said—and it's a great quote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Watching my mum work as hard as she did as a single mum, instilled in me a good work ethic and has had a profound impact on how I approach my career and personal development.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She very much has ambitious goals. She wants to open her own business, she wants to work overseas and she wants to showcase her talent on an even greater international scale. I say to Jasmine: Well done. You have done not only yourself and your family but, indeed, your community proud.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Newcastle brings this WorldSkills Competition 2024 motion to the House, and I commend her for that. I also note her dedication to TAFE. I know she has been on her feet a number of times during her parliamentary career to talk up the value of TAFE, and I share that passion with her, being a former TAFE student with quite a number of certificates from the Wagga Wagga college. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I heard the member for Gilmore criticise the opposition and our stance towards fee-free TAFE. What is being sold and what is being spruiked is not going to benefit entirely every single person who attempts to go and do a TAFE course. It is, just like the housing bills that this government has put forward, in that regard something of a misnomer. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only in recent hours have we seen Labor and the Greens cosy up on housing bills. It is so typical—phony indignation. Pretend as though this were some terrible thing that the Greens weren't partnering, and all of a sudden, lo and behold, in the death throes of the parliamentary year, when the government is doing so badly, the Greens political party have come to the party and agreed with Labor on the government's housing reforms—as if they were never going to. Let's face it: they will both swap preferences, as they always do, at the next election. This little lovers' tiff has been just that: just feigned indignation. It is mock outrage as though it were never going to happen, and we all know that it certainly was. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This comes at a time when, according to corporate watchdog ASIC, there were 2,832 construction industry insolvency appointments for the 2024 financial year until 16 June, an increase of 28 per cent on the 2,213 insolvencies over the previous financial year. The construction industry is doing it tough. We hear Labor talk a big game about building 1.2 million homes. That's not going to happen, not in a month of Sundays. It's just not going to happen. They talk about it; they're not going to produce it. They talk about fee-free TAFE; it's not free. This is so typical of this government, which has a lot to answer for.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:27</span>):  The member for Riverina is a good fella, but, if this housing and fee-free TAFE legislation doesn't pass, it's because those opposite don't want to see it pass, for obvious reasons. It's a good thing, and they don't want us to have a win for workforce. They don't want us to have a win for cost of living, which is why they haven't supported one single cost-of-living measure that we have managed to get through the parliament. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A strong vocational education and training sector is absolutely critical to ensuring that Territorians and all Australians, can get a secure and well paid job and, if you are a business owner, absolutely critical to making sure that you are getting the skilled workforce that you need. We have been investing in the skills that the Territory needs and that our nation needs by making fee-free TAFE permanent for young Territorians and young Australians but also for those who are retraining, perhaps for a new career or an advancement later in life. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This not only helps relieve cost-of-living pressures, as I just mentioned; it's also vital for us to secure our sovereignty and to build our future through building the skills that we need. Last month, my colleague, the Minister for Skills and Training, came up to Darwin and saw firsthand how fee-free TAFE is benefiting young Territorians in my electorate. We visited the Renewable Energy Microgrid Hub for Applied Research and Training, otherwise known as REMHART, down at East Arnhem, which is part of Charles Darwin University. It's an innovation hub for renewable energy systems that will be training and developing a Territory workforce that is equipped with the practical skills that are absolutely essential for a net zero transformation and, frankly, for turning the Northern Territory and Australia—mainly northern Australia—into a renewable energy superpower. This should be our future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the work, as I have before in this place, of Professor Suresh Thennadil and his team at REMHART. We plan to develop a Renewable Energy Centre of Excellence at CDU based on REMHART—but growing it—that brings together Charles Darwin University, industry and the Electrical Trades Union into a powerful collaboration to drive skilled jobs across the Northern Territory in the renewable sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is committed to investing in the skills Australia needs to drive economic growth and is delivering a VET system to deliver these skills. So many of the occupations in demand across Australia have direct VET pathways, and that knowledge, acquisition, education and training is a big part of the answer to the skills shortage question. Another part is making sure everyone can access top-quality education. A high-quality, world-class VET system is vital to responding to the challenges facing, and seizing the opportunities shaping, Australia's society, economy and environment—for example, a renewable energy future and a sustainable environment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that you can't have a strong VET sector without strong TAFEs. This is why the Albanese Labor government is investing in fee-free TAFE.    Fee-free TAFE is particularly benefitting Australians from priority cohorts, with over 170,000 young Australians—124,000 jobseekers and 30,000 First Australians—enrolling in the program. The Albanese government's 2024-25 budget delivers $600 million in some of these measures. I acknowledge all of those who were successful in winning the awards that were spoken about previously. It's really important that we grow our workforce and it is really important to mention and acknowledge all of those who are making this a reality. It's going to be so important for our future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="298840" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr REPACHOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:32</span>):  I rise to celebrate two of my greatest passions—no, not burgers and the world's best wines from the Hunter, but skills and representing Australia on the world stage. When I was 15, I left school and headed to TAFE to pursue a trade as a fitter and turner, or for those who know anything about the industry, as a toolmaker. It was one of the best decisions of my life, opening doors to a fulfilling career and a keen sense of purpose. Later I had the privilege of representing Australia as an Olympian. There is no greater honour than representing your country. These experiences taught me the transformative power of dedication, skill and opportunity. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what could be better than combining these passions—an 'Olympics' for trades and skilled professionals? Enter WorldSkills, a competition that gathers the world's most talented tradespeople, apprentices and trainees to test their expertise and showcase their mastery. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 47th WorldSkills international competition was held recently in Lyon, France, breaking records with over 1,400 competitors from 70 countries. Representing Australia were 32 extraordinary young people, the Skillaroos. And let me tell you: they smashed it. Performing in front of thousands of spectators, the Skillaroos demonstrated passion, perseverance and world-class skill. Competing against 70 nations, they achieved 14th place in the points tally, a testament to their talent and the strength of Australia's vocational education system. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Among the champions was the Hunter's very own Neave O'Reilly, a nurse with the Hunter New England Local Health District, competing in health care. Neave ranked 14th in the world—a phenomenal achievement. Neave, you are one of the most skilled nurses on the planet, and we are proud and thankful to have you in our workforce. Congratulations to Neave and every other member of the Skillaroos team.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Behind these competitors stand dedicated mentors, coaches and supporters. I want to say thank you to you all. Great teams create great champions, and your efforts inspire the next generation of Australians to pursue skills and trades. The Skillaroos exemplify what is possible through our vocational education and training sector, particularly through TAFE. Their success highlights the importance of accessible, high-quality skills training. That is why this government is backing TAFE like never before. Through fee-free TAFE, we have removed financial barriers for more than 508,000 Australians, giving them the chance to pursue fulfilling careers in essential industries like health care, construction and digital technologies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In just 18 months, fee-free TAFE has exceeded expectations. Six in 10 places have been taken up by women and a third by Australians from rural and regional areas. This program has changed lives, provided cost-of-living relief and addressed critical skills shortages across our nation. Yet those opposite dismiss fee-free TAFE as wasteful spending. Last week, they voted against it. They had a decade to address Australia's skills shortages and failed to act. Under their watch, Australia became the second-highest country in the OECD for labour shortages, and $3 billion was cut from VET funding. Let me be clear, TAFE is not wasteful. TAFE is vital. It is the backbone of Australia's VET sector. It is where we nurture talent, create opportunities and build the skilled workforce our country needs to thrive. From mining to clean energy, construction, health care and advanced manufacturing, TAFE leads the way in all these areas.  Under this government, we are rebuilding our public TAFE system, including vocational education and creating opportunities for Australians everywhere, regardless of background or circumstances.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The future of our economy is tied to our people and their skills, potential and aspirations. The Skillaroos inspire us, reminding us of the power of opportunity and hard work. As Brisbane prepares to host the 2032 Olympics, they will get a warm-up with the WorldSkills National Championship being held in Brisbane next June. This government will continue to support Australia's skilled workforce ensuring the Skillaroos shine brighter than ever on the international stage. To every young Aussie considering a trade, a traineeship or a vocational pathway, tradies are cool, and those of us on this side of the chamber are backing you in. Your potential is limitless, and your skills are vital to our nation's future. Thank you all. Remember, tradies are cool. Keep going to TAFE. TAFE loves you, and we love you. Cheers. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:37</span>):  I am happy to follow the Member for Hunter, with no member of the opposition speaking in between. They've downed tools when it comes to skills and TAFE, sadly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of my favourite Moreton places to visit is the flagship TAFE centre in Bradman Road, Acacia Ridge. It has new state-of-the-art facilities and provides training across a wide range of trades, including automotive, manufacturing and design, resources and mining, electrotechnology and engineering, to name a few. There are similarly excellent centres all around the country, and not just in the cities. There are TAFES in regional, rural and remote areas. They are producing thousands of people with qualifications that are addressing skills shortages in in-demand sectors. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you think of the thorough training students receive, it's no surprise that Australia was able to field such a strong team, the aptly named Skillaroos, at the recent international WorldSkills competition in France in September in Lyon. Luckily, I met some of them up here in the Mural Hall before they headed off to Lyon in France. I would like to congratulate the 29 young Aussies who showcased our outstanding vocational training sector. The Australian tradespeople, apprentices and trainees competed in events such as bricklaying, cybersecurity, cookery, plumbing, heating and fashion technology. The achievements of the Skillaroos are a reminder of how strong our vocational education and training sector is. In fact, it's of top world standard. This is important because a strong VET sector is crucial to set us up for Australia's future needs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that by 2050 Australia will need a workforce where 80 per cent of the people have a university degree or some sort of TAFE qualification. The Albanese government understands that TAFE plays a key role in individuals setting themselves up for the future and in the development of a more productive workforce. TAFEs are also important when it comes to social infrastructure. They promote equity and inclusion, and inspire increased community cohesion. That's why Labor is committed to legislating for 100,000 fee-free TAFE places annually, across the country. We want to break down the barriers that are stopping people pursuing further education, and we know that Labor's free TAFE program has been a wonderful success story.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This program is direct cost-of-living relief, but it is much more than that. There have been 508,000 enrolments since 23 January. These enrolments bolster the workforces in the care sector, in technology and digital, in early childhood education and care, and in the construction sector—all areas where there were skills shortages. That's over half a million pathways to well-paid and secure employment, and the myriad benefits that that brings. Providing 100,000 fee-free places per year will ensure this ongoing pipeline of talent, which is also good for Australian businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another important factor in this government's free TAFE program is the benefit for priority cohorts. This has seen enrolment of 170,000 young Australians, 124,000 job seekers and 30,000 First Nations people. Sixty per cent of these places were taken by women, and nearly 30 per cent were in regional and remote Australia, because Labor will always look after the bush. The program truly has offered life-changing opportunities to all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bolstering of the VET sectors by the Albanese government sits within Labor's bigger picture of future-focused investments. The May budget included $600 million in measures to strengthen skills growth and investment in key industries such as clean energy, manufacturing and construction. This funding included specific focus areas such as efforts to implement the transition to net zero, bolstering the Building Women's Careers Program, and upskilling the housing and construction workforces. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Step by step, the Albanese Labor government is fixing the mess left to us after a decade of coalition inaction. Those opposite left us with not only $1 trillion in debt and a couple of black mugs but also the second-highest labour shortage per capita in the OECD. After ignoring the VET sector while in office, the opposition then continued to try their best to stymie growth. They didn't back fee-free TAFE and they didn't back any associated measures, such as expanded access to new energy apprenticeships or support for women's careers. And now they've made it clear that they will continue to oppose fee-free TAFE—after all, they called it 'wasteful spending'. As usual, with the opposition, we are left with more questions than answers. Will they tear up the fee-free TAFE agreements with every state and territory? How much will it cost under a coalition government for people to get the qualifications our country so critically needs? And fundamentally, what is their plan to fix the skills shortage crisis that they created? If you were looking for some clarity in their budget reply, you wouldn't have found it either—not a single skills policy in it. The Leader of the Opposition can't spell skills. He can't spell TAFE.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In October of this year, the Government Centre for Population released its research policy and paper 'Fertility decline in Australia: is it here to stay?' That had some very troubling statistics in it and some very troubling news for us, as a country, going forward. Essentially, the paper provides that fertility rates in Australia continue to decline—they have continued to decline over the past 2½ years under this Albanese Labor government. The average number of children born to Australian women in 2023 was 1.5.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, fertility outcomes are lower than fertility desires. This means that Australian women want to have more children, but, because of a series of circumstances, are unable to. The two main reasons that were identified in the government's own research paper were cost-of-living pressures that have caused Australians to postpone child-bearing and the high cost of housing that has made it increasingly difficult for young adults to achieve their homeownership goals prior to starting a family. The impacts of longer-term low fertility on a country such as Australia are very significant, bearing in mind that we currently—despite our very large landmass—have a population of around only 25 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past 30 years, the total fertility rates in Australia have continued to decline overall. There have been times when there were peaks—under the Howard-Costello government, for example, when the baby bonus was brought in. I'm very proud to say that I was one of the beneficiaries of that back in 2006, when I had my children James and Nicholas. Overall, fertility rates have declined, and they've taken a very sharp decline under this government. When we see why that is occurring, it has been sheeted home that it is the cost of living under this government. Most people that are trying to purchase a home or are paying off a mortgage have had 12 interest rate rises under this Labor government. The cost of housing has never been more expensive than it is under this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have seen is that, as one of the authors of the report, Ms Cho, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The long-term decline in fertility of younger mums as well as the continued increase in fertility of older mums reflects a shift towards later childbearing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We may originally think—does it really matter if women are having their children a little bit later? It really does. After about the age of 32, for most women, their fertility starts to decline at quite a rapid rate. Some of the social, cultural and economic impacts of declining fertility include that we will see a much larger ageing population. We'll see a reduced working population. We'll see an increase in pressure on the healthcare system, challenges to our aged-care and our pension systems, and cultural and social change, because, if we are having our children later, there is less chance, for example, that children will have the advantage of having grandparents around them. For older Australians, there is less chance that they will, in fact, be able to have the joy of grandchildren.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what do Australian women do? One of the other issues is, of course—I don't blame the government for this; I blame them for most of the other issues with fertility—that a lot of women these days simply do not meet their partner until they may be in their 40s, for example, which is often when their fertility is really going to struggle. What we have found over the past decades or so is a process of egg freezing. In that way, eggs are preserved when a woman is in a high-fertility part of her life, and then they can be utilised at a later date. But we need to do far more for women in that process. The process is not straightforward. It's expensive. It's prohibitive for most women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say that these fertility rate declines are a big problem and the Australian government needs to address this.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="309484" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BELYEA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:48</span>):  I'm pleased to be speaking on this motion by the member for Hughes. Fertility decline in Australia is not an issue unique to Australia. It reflects a global issue seen in most developed countries across the world. The total fertility rate over the past 30 years has slowly dropped from 1.86 in 1993 to 1.63 births per woman this year, 2024. This, of course, presents many complex challenges in a society like Australia, and there is no easy fix. Part of the reason for the decline in fertility is that more women are working than ever before, a trend that continues to increase.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Women's participation in paid work has increased considerably over the last 50 years. Women made up almost half the paid workforce in Australia in 2020 compared to around 30 per cent in 1966. Here in Australia, the gender pay gap continues to narrow, with the pay gap now at 21.1 per cent, down from 21.7 per cent last year. This is a good thing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So why do we have the issue of a decline in fertility rates? Financial pressures on families, the cost of living and housing affordability are massive, which means more women need to work, while other social issues such as the impact of climate change and the increasing threat of global conflict are things that generation Z and millennials deeply care about when they consider whether to have a family or not. I have spent time talking to gen Zs and millennials about whether they wish to have children or not. Many of them are concerned about the society they would be bringing their children into. This is something I'm deeply concerned about as I ponder what my 18-year-old son is going to inherit and have to deal with in terms of climate change and global conflict. This world is a complex and increasingly worrying place to live in, and our children know that because of the widespread dissemination of information through social media. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night, I watched a program on the ABC that also talked about the impact of lifestyle on fertility rates for both women and men. According to the research, about 30 per cent of women and men have issues with infertility. Infertility is increasing as a result of lifestyle, stress and diet. Research also indicates the use of plastics and the leaching of chemicals into our food are impacting fertility rates. But, of course, it must be acknowledged that a large reason why more women are working is due to economic pressures on households and individuals. The cost of raising children in Australia has risen dramatically.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what are we doing about it? The government knows that people are doing it tough right now. Our economic plan is all about helping people with their cost of living while fighting inflation. Bringing down inflation means we can bring down costs for households. The government's delivery on cost-of-living measures includes a tax cut for every taxpayer and energy bill relief, cheaper medicines and more bulk-billing GP visits, and cheaper childcare and early childhood educator pay rises. All of this is helping Australians earn more and keep more of what they earn. We've also made really good progress in the fight against inflation. It has more than halved since we came into power. Inflation had a six in front of it when we came into office, and now it has a two. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As homeownership rates have declined and rents have soared, younger generations face a dilemma of choosing between financial security and starting a family. This is particularly tough in municipalities like Dunkley. That's why the government is investing $32 billion into building more homes for Australians. In contrast, Peter Dutton and the Greens are blocking housing investment. In the middle of a housing crisis, Peter Dutton has committed to cutting $19 billion from housing. There are many other measures we are taking to address the fertility issue and support more people to have families. There is so much more we need to do, and we will do it. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MASCARENHAS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:54</span>):  I would like to thank the member for Dunkley for going first; I really appreciate that. Thank you, Deputy Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to talk about this important topic. I think the member for Hughes's motion is certainly interesting. I do want to say one thing: having children is a deeply personal choice made by individuals, and it is their choice. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my experience, decisions aren't simple and people weigh up multiple factors, such as timing, finances, health, personal goals and career. For some the choice might be to not have children at all. That is their right, and it's not our place to judge or question anybody's plan for parenthood or not. But it is our job, as the government, to make sure it is easier for those who want to start or grow a family. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Labor came into government, this country was in a mess. Let's not sugar-coat it. Wages were stuck and living standards were sliding. The coalition also had a women problem: not enough women in the caucus and not recognising that women choose to work. Often they work in the care industries, which historically has been undervalued. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But Labor has a plan. We have been promising to change all that and we have been. Wages are moving. The minimum wage is up 18 per cent and award wages are up 14 per cent. We have seen increases to wages in the aged-care sector, which is really important, and we hope to see increases in the early childhood education sector as well. Inflation now has a two in front of it. These figures are not made up; they are facts. The gender pay gap is the smallest it has ever been. This is real, tangible progress, but you wouldn't believe it if you listened to the opposition and paid attention to this motion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition is teaming up with the party of protest, the Greens, who have fought us every step of the way. They voted against wage increases time and time again. They're stuck in the past. Labor wants to move people forward; they want to make sure you're not stuck. The cost of living is on everyone's mind and it shapes so many big decisions—starting a family, buying a house or changing careers. We get it. It's shaping what I do every day in representing the interests of Swan. That's why we've tackled it head on. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under Labor, inflation has halved since we took office. We have delivered relief where it counts: bigger and better tax cuts for every taxpayer, energy bill relief for every household, cheaper child care—giving families more choices and extending paid parental leave to 26 weeks by 2026. Superannuation is being paid on paid parental leave, which will help lower the gap between superannuation balances of men and women. We've delivered paid prac for nursing and midwifery students. We also delivered pay rises in industries dominated by women, like aged care. These aren't just numbers; they are actually changes that are helping families get ahead. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What has the Opposition done? Nothing. Worse than nothing; they've actively blocked progress. They voted against cheaper child care, voted against wage increases and oppose an affordable housing plan that could put 40,000 people into homes. We're ready to go, but what I hear from the other side is no. They want to cut Medicare and they don't support affordable housing. They're out of touch with the needs of Australian families. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is delivering for families. We're making it easier to plan for the future, to balance work and family and to live with dignity. With many parents facing a tough decision about family planning, they deserve a government that's got their back—a government that supports them with affordable child care, secure housing and fair wages. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The biggest risks to families is the opposition. Their policies, or lack of them, would leave Australians worse off. We've seen their priorities; they don't include everyday Aussies in their plans. Labor is here to move this country forward, so we're lifting wages, cutting costs and supporting families. That's the Australia I believe in, a place where people can thrive and not just survive. We won't stop fighting for a better future for everyone: families, single people and couples. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:59</span>):  Thank you to the member for Fowler her assistance. I rise to speak on this important topic and thank the member for Hughes for raising it here today. I was quite concerned to see these released figures, and they should be ringing alarm bells for the government as well as fertility rates in Australia continue to decline under this government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The average number of children born to Australian women in 2023 was just 1.5. There is a perfect storm brewing that is impacting on Australians' choices in relation to having children, which, if not corrected, will have long-term consequences. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Increasing cost-of-living pressures are one key issue that has forced Australians to delay having children, and the high cost of housing has made it increasingly difficult for young adults to achieve their homeownership goals prior to starting a family. The Albanese government has failed to manage the economy, resulting in a period of skyrocketing home-grown inflation which is fuelling the current cost-of-living crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Very few Australians can say they are better off than they were almost three years ago, and many are falling behind, despite the Prime Minister's assertions before the last election, when he repeatedly stated that Australians would be better off under him and that no-one would be left behind. Well, they are being left behind—in droves. The employee cost-of-living index shows that for employee households the cost of living is up by 18.9 per cent. We've seen families' standards of living slashed, with the largest fall in real disposable income in the advanced world. Disposable incomes have collapsed by 8.7 per cent under this Labor government—the largest fall since records began. Interest rates have increased 12 times. Mortgage interest payments have tripled. A family with a mortgage is $35,000 worse off. And household savings have collapsed by 10 percentage points.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has to date failed to address the housing crisis or the serious cost-of-living pressures facing Australian couples and leading them to have to make the difficult choice between starting a family and paying their bills. It is highly concerning that the government's serious economic and housing mismanagement has forced Australians to delay having children, resulting in this significant decline in fertility rates. The Treasurer says there's nothing to see here, that this is 'the landing we've been planning for and preparing for'. But Australians know there is nothing soft about this landing. Instead, prices are still rising, and Australians have now experienced almost three years of above-band inflation. Australians are feeling the pinch, and that's why inflation needed to be attacked aggressively and early. But Australians are paying the price at the checkout, and cost pressures are eating away at Australian small business margins.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has wasted time and squandered opportunities for action. But its members keep repeating their lines: that they've made medicine cheaper, that they've made it cheaper to see a doctor, that they've reduced electricity prices and that they've made child care cheaper. But it is political sleight of hand when rising prices have far outstripped any discount the government might have provided. Worse, it overlooks the fact that doctor and childcare shortages mean that the service can't be accessed anyway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently hosted the shadow minister for early education, Angie Bell, in my electorate, where we heard firsthand about the chronic shortage of childcare places across the region, with waiting lists for places. And I know from talking to many of my constituents that this is a direct issue impacting family decision-making when it comes to starting or adding to their family. If this is what the government thinks is 'all going to plan', Australians should be deeply concerned. Australians are hurting and can't hang on while their government keeps telling them they've never had it so good. And they can't trust this government when it says it's part of their plan—'Just trust us; we're working on it.' I call on the government to better manage the economy and to take action to correct course urgently, starting with MYEFO, and lay out some certainty so that Australians can make decisions about their future with confidence and certainty.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="210911" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TEHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:03</span>):  A cost-of-living crisis has real implications right across the board. It has real implications for the household budgets that people are facing at the moment. When you look at the facts, they are absolutely damning as to what this government, the Albanese Labor government, has delivered for the Australian people: the largest fall in real disposable income in the advanced world. Disposable incomes have collapsed by 8.7 per cent under this Labor government—the largest fall since records began. We have never had tougher times in this country than those that are being faced by the Australian people at the moment. That has real implications, and one of those implications is that we're seeing that, at a greater rate, people are putting off having children. Families and couples are taking the decision to put off having children, and now we've seen our fertility rate drop to 1.5.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, and the Treasurer, Jim Chalmers, say: 'There's nothing to see here. Everything is fine.' Well, by every measure, it's clear that everything isn't fine and they have to, before it is too late and they cause too much pain, focus on addressing the cost-of-living crisis in this nation. And, if they don't, then they should just say, 'This job of being in government is too hard for us, and we're going to let someone else have a try.' They could start by addressing the fact that we have seen personal income taxes increase by 25 per cent in the 2½ years they've been here. So you've seen real disposable incomes drop at a rate greater than nowhere else in the world, yet we've seen income taxes go up by 25 per cent. No wonder people are feeling pain in their household budgets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only that but they are putting pressure on when it comes to housing, and we've seen how that pressure has been placed on the Australian people. They haven't been allowing houses to be built, and they've let in a million people in just over two years. So there are no houses being built, and a million people have come into this country, and they wonder why we've got a rental crisis and a housing crisis. Why then are young Australians especially going, 'I don't know whether this is the right economic climate to have children in and I don't know whether I can afford to have children, because, first of all, I want to be able to put a roof over my head.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why this motion is so important: it calls out the government to finally act. Get your heads out of the sand, Prime Minister and Treasurer, and understand the pain that you're causing people and understand that you need to act. You've got one last opportunity before the election, because we're all assuming the election is going to be in March, and that's the MYEFO. So when you deliver the MYEFO, Treasurer, in the lead-up to Christmas, let's see you address some of these cost-of-living issues. If you do that, you might start to instil some confidence—into young people, in particular—that now is the time to start a family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">
                  </span>But, if you continue down your policy approach—with a 25 per cent increase in income tax and through making sure that disposable incomes reduce at a rate that we've never seen before, making sure that you're not building houses and making sure that you're continuing to deliver your 'big Australia' policy, which has seen one million people come to this country in the last couple of years—then I can tell you that what we're going to see, sadly, is that fertility rate get even worse. We have to ensure that young Australians can have the dream of owning their own home and having their own family.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms DANIEL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:42</span>):  How we treat the most vulnerable among us reflects the values we uphold as a society. This Migration Amendment (Prohibiting Items in Immigration Detention Facilities) Bill 2024, now in its fifth iteration since 2017, falls short of these values. Despite minor amendments, it remains deeply flawed and its passage would compromise the rights and dignity of individuals already in highly precarious situations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation aims to expand the search and seizure powers of detention offices, including confiscating mobile phones. These measures allegedly address safety concerns, yet the evidence does not adequately support such sweeping powers. Instead, it risks exacerbating the situation for detainees, who are already detained for an average of 513 days—nearly 1½ years—sometimes without any criminal conviction. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Human Rights Law Centre has highlighted how these expanded powers will isolate detainees further, cutting them off from their families and legal counsel. I understand the government's arguments about bikie links and such, but human rights still apply. Mobile phones are lifelines for detainees, many of who are held in facilities far from loved ones. Confiscating personal devices disrupts communication, delaying access to legal support critical for challenging detention or ensuring accountability. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Existing laws like the Migration Act 1958 already grant detention offices powers to manage risks, including searching for and seizing contraband, while police are equipped to handle serious crimes. Claims of endemic criminality among detainees lack sufficient substantiation. While some do have prior convictions, some pose no security risk. They are not all the same. For those who do have a criminal history, provisions may well be warranted, but they must be specific and targeted, not catchall. Even the Human Rights Commission report into the Yongah Hill centre, which this bill leans heavily on, notes the complexity of different cases and different environments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to manage the risks that staff face in detention facilities—that is absolutely true—but these provisions lack oversight and could easily be misused. Past inquiries into similar legislation, such as the mobile phone ban bill 2021, concluded that current frameworks are sufficient. Yet this bill broadens powers, permitting invasive strip searches and arbitrary confiscations under vague terms like 'order' and 'safety'. Such measures, disproportionately targeting asylum seekers, are inconsistent with Australia's human rights obligations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for North Sydney perfectly articulated, Labor's support for this bill is a significant shift from its previous stance on provisions to prohibits items like mobile phones in detention facilities. For example, in both 2017 and 2020, Labor senators voiced strong opposition to the bill's provisions, stating:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the government has not demonstrated any attempt to address these risks in less restrictive ways than those proposed in the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They also emphasised the critical importance of detainees' access to communication, asserting:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the evidence highlights the importance of mobile phones in allowing detainees to communicate with their legal representatives and external support networks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I couldn't agree more. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's support for this new iteration of the legislation directly contradicts its earlier positions, raising questions about the party's commitment to detainees' rights and the principles that it previously championed—not to mention the fact that the crossbench was briefed on this today, in the last sitting week of the year. What a surprise! And, while the bill claims to provide safeguards, the alternative communication options it proposes, such as landlines or shared internet terminals, are inadequate. Landlines in detention centres are few and communal, restricting timely or private communication. Internet access is scarce and must be booked in advance, making urgent legal matters nearly impossible to address. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Access to communication is not a privilege. It is a basic right, particularly for those seeking asylum or justice, and providing dumb phones is not enough. Stripping detainees of the right to communication risks silencing voices that hold power accountable and amplify stories of mistreatment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At its core, this bill reflects a troubling willingness to compromise human rights in favour of administrative convenience. With detainees already subjected to significant restrictions, adding further layers of control risks stripping away their dignity entirely. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of punitive measures we should focus on strengthening oversight, accountability and transparency within detention centres. Evidence based policies are the solution to safety concerns, not sweeping legislation treating all detainees as threats. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill echoes the failed approaches of past administrations, prioritising control over compassion. Australians have a responsibility to uphold human rights and fairness, and this legislation fails that standard. I will not support it.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:48</span>):  The government introduced this bill, the Migration Amendment (Prohibiting Items in Immigration Detention Facilities) Bill 2024, on 21 November 2024, just last week, and it is the third of a suite of bills with which the government appears to be on a very rapid race to the bottom in its attempts to mimic the draconian efforts of the last government to treat the most vulnerable people—people seeking asylum in this country—in a fashion which is not humanitarian, is not generous and does not recognise or reflect the values of electorates like the one I represent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to note for those constituents of Kooyong who are watching tonight that this is not a new bill. This is the fourth time that this bill, or an iteration of it, has been brought to the House. The first time was in 2017 when Peter Dutton was the immigration minister. The bill was reintroduced in 2019 and 2020, and on each occasion it failed to pass because of a significant backlash from not only the other sides of the House but also the community. In fact, when the ALP wrote a dissenting report in 2020, essentially to this very bill, it noted the extent of community backlash and, really, revulsion about the premises of the bill. That actually led to a community petition signed by 140,000 Australians expressing their disgust at the measures that we're discussing with this bill. They had the opportunity to do that because this is a democracy and in a democracy people have a right or an ability to give feedback about things the government is planning that they care about. But citizens are denied that right when a bill is put before the House with this degree of haste.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What would this bill do? The bill would essentially give the minister sweeping powers to ban almost any item in a detention centre. Those items would include everyday items like mobile phones. The bill has the ability to cut off from their loved ones and from their crucial supports people who are vulnerable and already in a place they do not want to be, who are subjected to conditions in their life they do not want to live within. It would limit their ability to hold the government responsible for the circumstances of their detention. Under this bill as it is laid out, the minister can determine that almost any item is a prohibited item. They could be things that are illegal and which could be the subject of criminal activity, but they could also be things the minister believes might be a risk to the health, safety or security of people and the detention facility or to the 'order' of the facility, whatever that might be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also expands the basis for officers in the detention centre to undertake invasive strip searches. It gives broad new powers for officers to conduct area searches within the centre, which could include examination of people's rooms, their personal effects, common areas or even medical examination areas. And officers within the detention centres will be able to use force to conduct those searches. They can bring dogs or other external people in to help them. They can confiscate items they believe have been banned. It doesn't matter whether or not the person has been shown to have actually misused their phone in the past or to have engaged in any conduct which has put other people at risk. If the officer feels this is a reasonable thing to do to reduce any risk to health, safety, security or order in the detention facility then the officer can do that. We can imagine how that power might be misused by people who don't necessarily have inmates' best interests in mind. The bill also gives the minister the ability to issue blanket directions about the exercise of search and seizure powers within detention centres.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's important to note that many of these powers are actually already in the hands of the minister and people who run the centres. They already have search-and-seizure powers if they are dealing with illegal or dangerous items in a detention centre. We have to remember detention centres aren't prisons. But the distinction appears to be moot in the context of this legislation. The minister and officers are already able to undertake those searches and those seizures under the Migration Act under their common law duty of care, and we have to remember as well, remembering that these are not prisons, that these centres are in many instances being staffed by contract personnel who are not subject to the same rules or, shall we say, degree of oversight as police people or ABF. I think it's really important that we note that people who are in detention shouldn't have to exist under a harsher regime just because of their visa status. These people are not criminals. Now, some of them, we're told, have been guilty of criminal activity within the detention centres that we are discussing, but, if that's the case, the people running those centres have the ability to resort to the criminal justice system. The mere fact that that sort of activity might be taking place is not a justification for changing the rules around the places themselves. Were that the case, then you could argue that similar powers should be given to teachers in schools, where very often illegal activity is undertaken, or a music festival or any other spot where people undertake illegal activity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think, at the end of the day, we have a duty to first do no harm to people who are vulnerable in our justice system, whether that be the criminal justice system or the immigration system. It's worth us remembering that, between 2019 and 2024, there were more than 700 episodes of self-harm by people in immigration detention centres in this country and there were 29 deaths. It's hard to imagine the imposition of the rules that the government has put before us with such a lack of due diligence, consultation or community feedback. They will hurt people who are vulnerable and who already, just by the circumstances that lead to them finding themselves in these immigration detention centres, lack the power and the agency that ordinary Australians have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also worth remembering that this particular bill that has been put in front of the House with such short notice is only one of three significant bills that the government is pushing through with unseemly haste at this point in time. We've recently seen the Migration Amendment Bill, which has imposed ankle bracelets and curfews on prisoners, we've seen our government arranging to pay other sovereign states to take our noncitizens—but we don't have a whole lot of clarity about what that involves—and we've seen the government reviving its deportation bill as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not the sort of Labor government that many of us expected when Mr Albanese became Prime Minister, in 2022. Many Australians expected a government which would be more just and more generous. Gandhi said, 'The true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable members.' This treatment is not reflective of the Australia that I know, that I love and that I hope to represent.</span>
