                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Broadcasting Services Amendment (2021 Measures No. 1) Bill 2021 includes a range of six measures to reduce regulatory burden, reform outdated regulations that are no longer fit for purpose and enable Australia's media industry to continue to provide services and content valued by audiences across the country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 to the bill proposes to amend the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to reduce the expenditure required by subscription broadcast channel providers and licensees on new eligible drama expenditure from 10 per cent to five per cent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments will reduce the regulatory burden on channel providers and licensees, and form part of a broader set of reforms to the regulation of Australian content announced by this government on 30 September 2020. These reforms include measures to: modernise Australian content rules for commercial free-to-air broadcasters (including simplifying and reducing obligations); and provide greater support for the production and distribution of Australian content, particularly in drama, documentary and children's content. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes to the drama expenditure requirement for subscription broadcasters included in the bill reform unsustainable obligations on the industry and create a more consistent regulatory framework. They are part of a package of measures that will enable Australians to continue to have access to Australian content across a range of mediums, regardless of whether they prefer to watch free-to-air television, subscription television or streaming services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill proposes allowing future rules for subscription television captioning to be made via ministerial instrument. The captioning rules for subscription television captioning are very complex. There is limited transparency for consumers in the level of captioning on different subscription television channels.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current exemption and application processes mean that captioning targets can be altered during the year and even during the annual reporting process. Exemptions are not based on objective criteria, so there is no transparency as to why some services are exempt and some are not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The application process for exemptions is onerous for licensees and for the Australian Communications and Media Authority. The subscription television industry, the Australian Communications and Media Authority and consumer groups support a simplified and more transparent framework for subscription television captioning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed instrument to govern future subscription television captioning requirements will be a disallowable instrument and the existing legislation would not lapse until the disallowance period passes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill proposes to remove the existing requirement on regional and remote television broadcasters to provide additional captioning on free-to-air multichannels beyond that provided by metropolitan TV  broadcasters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This requirement is an anomaly that arose from the change of regional network affiliations in 2016. The removal of this additional obligation will help viewers in regional and remote areas to continue receiving access to the multichannels.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill proposes enabling a retrospective application of grandfathering powers to protect radio broadcasters from potential breaches when the Australian Communications and Media Authority makes a population determination under section 30 of the Broadcasting Services Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposal also includes a sunsetting provision of five years for the application of these amended grandfathering powers. This clearly signals to licensees the government's commitment to review the state of the market and their provision of services in relation to these provisions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These proposed arrangements will support broadcasters in meeting their requirements while balancing net population movements that affect licence population areas, under the section 30 determinations, and having regard to market conditions supporting competition and low barriers for new licensees. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also proposes to make two minor amendments to ensure that the provisions for the broadcasting industry remain current. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first amendment proposed would remove a redundant requirement for digital radio planning in the Radiocommunications Act 1992. Digital radio could previously be provided in different parts of the spectrum, but now the standard has been reduced to one. There is, therefore, no requirement for planning within a licence area to ensure that all channels are within the same spectrum band. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second amendment proposed is to add an additional time frame to that currently provided for the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation program to enable funding delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic to be allocated beyond 1 July 2021. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These measures demonstrate the government's commitment to reform and streamline regulation across the broadcasting industry. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Migration Amendment (Clarifying International Obligations for Removal) Bill 2021 amends the Migration Act to clarify that, in line with Australia's international obligations relating to non-refoulement, the removal power in the Migration Act does not require or authorise removal of a person where they have been assessed as engaging those obligations<span style="font-style:italic;">.</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under these treaties, Australia has an obligation not to return individuals to situations where they face: persecution; a real risk of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; arbitrary deprivation of life; or the application of the death penalty.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, a number of court decisions have made it clear that section 197C, which was inserted to limit successful injunctions to prevent removal where a person has been assessed as not engaging protection obligations, also operates to require removal where the person has been assessed as engaging those obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is quite obviously not reflective of the original intent of section 197C under the Migration Act.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill seeks to address this disconnect by making it clear that the Migration Act does not require or authorise the removal of a person to a country in relation to which the person has been assessed in the statutory protection visa process as facing persecution or a real risk of torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, arbitrary deprivation of life or the application of the death penalty. This change will improve our nation's ability to uphold human rights.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this bill goes one step further. It does not just clarify that we are not obliged to remove a person in breach of our international obligations. It improves our ability to ensure that people who lodge valid protection visa applications will have their protection claims assessed in all cases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the current Migration Act, a person seeking Australia's protection can lodge an application for a protection visa unless they are barred from doing so. But where those applicants fail certain criteria, it is possible under the Migration Act for the person's protection visa application to be refused without those protection claims being considered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the amendments proposed by this bill<span style="font-style:italic;">, </span>a person who has lodged a valid protection visa application will always<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>have their protection claims assessed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an important change which will further improve our ability to ensure that we uphold Australia's non-refoulement<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>obligations. It is essential that Australia sends a strong message that we are committed to upholding human rights, and that we remain steadfast in our commitment to these treaties and their underlying principles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill protects the integrity of Australia's migration framework and it deserves the support of all members. It does present an opportunity for those within this parliament to stand up and demonstrate their ongoing commitment to human rights by ensuring that we are not obliged to remove a person from Australia where that removal would be in breach of non-refoulement obligations, and by ensuring that those who lodge a valid protection visa application can always have their claims assessed.</span>

These go to recommendations that were made by the ACCC, when the parliamentary joint committee reviewed the operation of the penalty provisions within the franchising code and related instruments. It's worth retelling the submission of the ACCC to that inquiry. It made the point that its ability to seek civil pecuniary penalties and issue infringement notices was fundamental to the ACCC's enforcement toolkit. The lack of consequences for breaching the franchising codes was undermining the ACCC's ability to ensure code compliance. Where penalties were insufficient, the franchisors were likely to factor that into their egregious behaviour and just build that into the cost of doing business, or doing business unfairly, in respect of their franchisees. Where penalties were unavailable, there's no incentive for a franchisor to comply with the codes. The ACCC noted that the penalties currently available under franchising code were small in comparison to those that were available under the Australian Consumer Law.</span>

Labor will be supporting this amendment.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms HAMMOND</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:54</span>):  I'm pleased to speak in support of the Mutual Recognition Amendment Bill 2021. With all respect to my fellow Western Australian the member for Tangney, who is also the assistant minister who introduced this bill, this is not the stuff that gets headlines. It doesn't attract attention. For many people it is pretty dryâjust dealing with red tape and improving the regulation of certain occupations and industries. For those who don't work in those industries or occupations, they won't be aware of the problems that it addresses, nor will they be consciously aware of the benefits which will flow. Yet these reforms introduced by this bill will not just impact upon those who work in these industries; there will also be benefits which flow more widely. These reforms are part of the government's economic recovery plan and complement existing work by governments to reduce red tape for business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our first point to note is that these changes are the result of cross-government agreement. In August 2020 the Morrison government announced that the Commonwealth government and state and territory governments had agreed to introduce a uniform scheme for the automatic mutual recognition of occupational registrations, subject to the passage of legislation. In December 2020 the Prime Minister, the state premiers and the Northern Territory Chief Minister signed the Intergovernmental Agreement on Automatic Mutual Recognition of Occupational Registration, which included a commitment to monitor the implementation of AMR and to support ongoing improvements in the regulatory environment. The changes presented in this bill represent the most significant reform to Australia's mutual recognition arrangements for occupational registrations since they were introduced in 1992.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In essence, this bill improves occupational mobility and helps our skilled workers take up job opportunities whenever and wherever they arise. This bill introduces a scheme for the automatic mutual recognition, or AMR, of occupational registrations. AMR allows carpenters, electricians, surveyors and other registered professionals to do the same work they are licensed to do at home in other states without applying for additional licences or paying further fees. AMR will remove unnecessary tension in labour markets that makes it costly and time consuming for workers to deliver services across state borders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over 19 per cent of Australian workers require a registration or a licence to perform their work. Some occupations, including many within the health sector, are registered nationally. But most trades and other professions, such as builders, plumbers and real estate agents, are registered on a state-by-state basis. Regulatory requirements and processes for most registered professions are managed and set differently in each of the eight states and territories. These differences make it harder for tradespersons and other professionals to move across borders for work, raising the cost for employers to fill job vacancies and reducing competition and choice for consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Issues with the current system have been articulated by numerous professional bodies, including the Chamber of Commerce and Industry WA, which has noted that the current system creates disincentives for employers to offer their apprentices opportunities to work across multiple states and territories, and, in turn, ensure that they have constant work. This is because it takes time and it is complex to have their existing studies recognised by regulators across multiple jurisdictions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mutual recognition under the existing AMR has helped reduce barriers to occupational mobility across borders for a range of occupations. Around 12 per cent of new occupational registrations were made under mutual recognition in 2019. However, a person is still required to apply and pay for additional registration, even though they have already paid for their current registration in another state or territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a 2015 study the Productivity Commission found that the current mutual recognition arrangements generally work well but that there would be cost savings from automating these processes. The Productivity Commission recommended governments give higher priority to expanding the use of automatic mutual recognition of occupational registrations to improve the efficiency of mutual recognition arrangements for individuals and businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the key benefits of the AMR, which is being introduced through this bill, include increased flexibility and mobility for individuals and businesses so that they can easily move across borders and provide services nationally. It will lead to greater competition, leading to lower prices, greater choice and better-quality service for consumers, including businesses. It will allow individuals and businesses to save on registration fees, on paperwork and on the time involved in filling out that paperwork. It will lead to increased output, investment and productivity and less downtime following infrastructure outages or natural disasters. There will be improved safety from improved information and data sharing across regulators to support compliance and there will be improved performance from regulators adopting a more risk based approach and people with disciplinary actions being excluded from AMR.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the issue of the benefits, PwC took an economic review of the costs and benefits of AMR in 2020, and it estimated that AMR is expected to increase GDP by $2.4 billion over the 10-year period from 2021 to 2030 from a better allocation of labour and capital in the economy. GDP would be higher over the period due to an increase in labour productivity from administrative savings to individuals and regulators no longer needing to submit or assess multiple occupational registrations. This will lead to an increase in GDP of $1.14 billion over the 10-year period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There will also be labour productivity benefits as more individuals choose to operate across jurisdictions for part of their working year, better matching registered individuals with jobs where they can deliver the greatest benefit. This will lead to an increase in GDP of $462 million over the 10-year period. And the additional savings that the PwC report identified were through capital productivity from returning to business as usual faster following natural disasters as interstate labour is able to more quickly mobilise to respond to critical and immediate large-scale infrastructure outages. This will lead to an increase in GDP of $808 million over the 10-year period. PwC found that over 124,000 registered people will benefit from reduced administrative costs, and a further 44,000 registered people may benefit from increased labour mobility across sectors and jurisdictions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The PwC modelling indicated that all jurisdictions will benefit from implementing AMR, with gross state product expected to rise over the 10-year period in each jurisdiction. The modelling does not include potential efficiency gains from removing unnecessary or inconsistent registration requirements over time. Cutting red tape may not attract attentionâit may never get a headlineâbut ensuring that there is an appropriate balance in the regulatory environment to ensure that there are not unnecessary, costly or inefficient regulations while maintaining the standards of protection for consumers, the environment, animal welfare and the safety of workers and the public is actually a very important role for all governments. On this basis I am happy to commend this bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MARLES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corio</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:02</span>):  I rise to speak on the Mutual Recognition Amendment Bill 2021 and on the amendments to the bill, which have been circulated in my name. This bill seeks to introduce a uniform scheme of automatic mutual recognition for licenced occupations across the states and territories. The principle of providing greater ease for those with licensed occupations to pursue their trade across the various jurisdictions in Australia is a worthy principle indeed. The bill amends the Mutual Recognition Act of 1992. This act was born of the economic reforms of the Hawke-Keating era. It was a period of significant microeconomic reform. This reform wasn't headlined 'Floating the dollar' or 'Opening up the Australian economy' but was nevertheless an important piece of microeconomic reform at the time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">About 70 per cent of the Australian workforce today is required to obtain a licence in order to undertake their work, and automatic mutual recognition, as I said, enables those who have licences to pursue their work in other states. Back at the time of the Mutual Recognition Act in 1992, then senator John Button, as the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, said in respect of mutual recognition:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is a good example of cooperative federalism at work in the national interest. Honourable senators have said that the aim of mutual recognition is to remove artificial barriers to interstate trade in goods and services and to remove the artificial barriers to the mobility of labour caused by regulatory differences amongst the States. We have had many decades of experience in trying to work with regulatory barriers of that kind, and this legislation will go a long way to improving that situation immensely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If the legislation does that, it will enhance the competitiveness of the Australian economy. It is a major step forward in the achievement of micro-economic reform and will lead to the establishment of a truly national market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To that end, the bill which is before us today seeks to build on the mutual recognition regime by applying an automatic component to it. I note that it is part of an intergovernmental agreement which has been signed by all the states. The agreement is due to come into effect on 1 July this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To describe in its simplest terms the architecture of automatic mutual recognition, it applies a drivers licence model to licensed occupations. That is to say that, if you have a drivers licence given to you in the state of Victoria, it entitles you to drive in the state of Western Australia. Western Australia would, if you were driving there, have all its enforcement arrangements apply to you. Were you to be speeding in Western Australia, that would reflect on your Victorian drivers licence. That, in effect, is the architecture of the mutual recognition which is being proposed in relation to all licensed occupations in Australia and how people would engage in their trade in jurisdictions other than where they obtain their licence. So the principle of this makes sense.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are, however, a number of issues which have been raised by a number of stakeholders which are present in our mind as we move forward and which underpin the amendments to the bill I will move. The principle of the drivers licence analogy needs to acknowledge that we have consistent road rules around Australia, but when it comes to a number of licensed occupations there is nothing like the same consistency in the way in which those regulations are in place across the jurisdictions in Australia. An example of that is the licensing of electricians, which varies considerably from state to state. So, while one can see what is sought to be done here, given that nothing like the consistency applies in relation to electrical occupations compared to road rules, which is the basis of the architecture here, there is the risk for unintended consequences to apply.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those unintended consequences could happen in a couple of ways. The first is that people who are in a jurisdiction where the licensing requirements are not as significant as others may go into another jurisdiction where licensing is stricter and find themselves in a situation where they are not able to comply with the standards of the second jurisdiction. Equally, in seeking to comply with those standards, they may well run afoul of them and then find that that flows back in terms of their ability to pursue their trade in their home state.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To that end, it is the position of Labor that we are seeking an inquiry in the other place in respect of this bill to be clear about how this would impact on various occupations where there is significant divergence in relation to the way in which those regulations apply across the jurisdictions. That is particularly the case in respect of high-risk occupationsâelectrical trades being an example of thatâbut really so are all the occupations which require licences within the building industry. That is where there is a significant degree of risk. Again, to that end, the amendments that I will move today are to have the licensed occupations which are involved in the building industry removed from the application of this bill. That is the intent of the amendments that are being circulated in my name. Those are the amendments to the bill that we will move in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we acknowledge the direction of this bill, while we acknowledge the intentâthe significant benefits in relation to deregulation that it implies and the ability for people to move with greater ease in the working of their trades across jurisdictionsâit is important that reforms of this kind are done in a way that doesn't have unintended consequences in relation to the health and safety of those working in the industry and the quality of work that is ultimately done for the consumers of this country. It's important that we look at all of those questions very carefully and that there is the ability to have an inquiry of that kind and move through that process over the next few months so that we are at a point within the parliament to consider this in its finality prior to the implementation date of the intergovernmental agreement, which is 1 July this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;" />So, noting the benefits, the principle behind this bill; noting our concerns about the unintended consequences and the detail of that, and the need to have an inquiry in the other place; and noting with all of that the amendments that we will move in order to deal with that here, Labor will be pursuing this bill on that basis.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:11</span>):  I rise to speak on the Mutual Recognition Amendment Bill 2021. I strongly support the amendments to this bill to be moved by the shadow minister for national reconstruction, employment, skills and small business. The shadow minister's motion to exclude electrical and construction workers from this bill is essential. Without the amendments, this bill would make the electrical and construction sectors less capable and more dangerous. Put simply, this bill will mean that the same standard will not be applied across the nation, exposing workers to risk and varying the quality of workmanship. This bill seeks to introduce a uniform scheme of interstate automatic recognition into the Mutual Recognition Act. It would allow workers to move interstate with their accreditation and pick up work more easily. It sounds good, but the devil is in the detail. It will open the door to different standards of workmanship across our nation. Ideally, we need a national standard of accreditation that ensures that all employees in a trade are provided with high-quality skills and training that is consistent. This amendment is important now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government says that this is about cutting red tape, but in practice it will create inconsistencies in the quality of work in critical industries. Rewiring a house, building foundations for a new home or completing a renovation need to be done to the highest standard. We all need comfort that these works are done to a high standard of safety and quality. We need a national set of regulations, but we also need to ensure that these safeguards are consistent across all states and territories. Without this amendment, we lose the safeguards that are already in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill throws the baby out with the bathwater and it leaves workers vulnerable, and it doesn't guarantee the high quality of workmanship we all have come to expect and value. Right now the system wins out through the oversight by the states. When one state falters and slackens on safety requirements, the current arrangements have built-in checks. When an electrician or a construction worker moves interstate, the new state will monitor their practice. When someone with substandard training moves interstate, they will be identified. States can flag a slackening in standards that is happening in other states, and then they can pressure the licensing state into closer oversight. This is a valuable, natural mechanism through which substandard and unsafe practice is identified and removed from the sector. This is a good thing. It's an effective way of managing risk. But if we pass this bill without the amendment, the checks and balances will be lost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports the objective of mutual recognition to enable workers to seamlessly move between states. We certainly believe that, wherever possible, red tape should be removed, and we want to make people's lives easier. It's a worthwhile goal. People should be able to transition their skills across state borders and have freedom of movement within Australia, but it should not be done in a way that puts workers at risk and reduces the high standards within the construction and electrical sectors. Without this amendment, this bill undermines this outcome. The safety of the electrical and construction sectors is paramount. Safe electrical and construction work is something that we must have. We do not want to see serious injury and death. Let me make this point. What is at stake is not just a matter of regulation. This bill could be a matter of life and death for electrical workers, for apprentices learning on the job, for families at home and for everyone at their places of work, leisure and education. These are high stakes professions, and they must be treated with respect, with national safeguards incorporated in regulations. It's not rocket science, but it is important. We should be trying to harmonise these rules, but we shouldn't be trying to ride roughshod over the differences, because those differences represent differences in real-world practices that make a difference to all our safety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor stand firm on defending the right of qualified tradespeople to move around the country and work in different states. We support safe, secure jobs for tradespeople, but we need to ensure that, while workers have this freedom to move, they are protected against risk, and that the quality of work remains consistently high. That is why we need these amendments. I thank the deputy leader of the Labor Party for putting forward these amendments, and I hope that an inquiry into this matter will proceed. Without it, this government will do real harm to workers and families across our nation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="240756" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PASIN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:16</span>):  My electorate has, to its eastern boundary, the South Australian and Victorian borders. I grew up in, and live in, the city of Mount Gambier. That's 18 kilometres from the Victorian border. All along my electorate's eastern boundary are communities like Mount Gambier that exist in very close proximity to the Victorian borderâin many cases much, much closer to the border than Mount Gambier is. Indeed, I have constituents who own property that spans the border. So, when the concept of mutual recognition of licences and registrations was first canvassed in this place, I've got to tell you that I got excited.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A bill like this oneâthe Mutual Recognition Amendment Bill 2021âis not the kind of legislation that normally gets members of parliament excited, but, when you live in a community that's so close to a jurisdictional state border, you understand the kind of rubbish that you have to deal with because of the difference in regulations and red tape spanning those state borders. In effect, in my community, these borders are nothing more than artificial lines on a map. We traverse them daily and, on many occasions, multiple times a day. That was highlighted during the lockdown. It was increasingly clear to me that, during the lockdown phase of the COVID-19 response, decision-makers were making decisions about cross-border travel in circumstances where they'd never lived in a cross-border community. For many of them, travelling across a border is an opportunity to pull the car over and take a happy snap with the family as you're travelling, for example, into Victoria. In my case, when I had very young children, when they were having trouble sleeping, I would put them in the car and drive them to Victoria because it was a convenient 36-kilometre, two-way trip. Invariably, they'd fall asleep. The joke in our household was that the way we got our children to go to sleep was to drive them to Victoria.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you live in a community like mine, when you represent a community like mine, stories of frustration experienced by tradesmen and tradeswomen, by real estate agents, by plumbers, by architects and by others abound. There are examples where an electrician attends a rural property and can work on the homestead but can't work on the shearing shed. There are examples where a real estate agent can sell one portion of a property but not the other and needs to work in consultation and collaboration with, for example, a Victorian real estate agent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't have a lot to thank COVID for, but there are some silver linings on the dark COVID cloud, and I'd respectfully suggest to you, Madam Deputy Chair, that this is one of them. COVID forced the Prime Minister and first ministers to work in an expedited and collaborative way like they've never had occasion to work before. That model thankfully, through the good agency of the assistant minister, means that we can achieve this kind of reform which is eminently sensible, is a great example of common sense, but that could never be achieved in the 120 or so years since Federation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what does it mean? Well, it means that if you're a tradesman in my electorate and you're qualified in South Australia you don't need to write off to the requisite authority in Victoria for approval to undertake work in Victoria. You can simply move across the border and do that work. The best example which I can give you is this: when you gain your drivers licence you don't then have to register that drivers licence in Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania, you're simply entitled to drive. Your drivers licence is acknowledged in a mutual way by those other jurisdictions and so it will be for professions that require licences and registrations across the country. That includes builders, electricians, plumbers, architects, real estate agents, security guards and one profession that I don't think will get a lot of attention in this debate, but is so important, which is teaching. In my electorate there are very many teachers, very many of whom do occasional and part-time teaching to supplement, perhaps, other incomes or part retirements, who live in Victoria but can't come to where the population centres are in South Australia and teach without going through the unnecessary regulatory steps to seek approval and these things. That's a silly circumstance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very pleased that this sensible change has been met with widespread acclaim. I'm not surprised it has been met with the approval of many bodies across the nation. I think this is the kind of sensible reform that shows the parliament and parliaments of this nation at their best. Let me quote the Australian Professional Teachers Association, who said, 'Many teachers in one jurisdiction currently do not pursue employment in another jurisdiction, because of the red tape and cost involved to simply become registered.' That will be a thing of the past. The Civil Contractors Federation states: 'The implementation of reforms that improve worker mobility and enable them to move more seamlessly between projects and at less cost is critical to achieving a more efficient delivery of Australia's infrastructure pipelines.' It stands to reason that, if workers have to pause the work they're doing to seek approval through an administrative process, that invariably takes time. Not only does it delay that work, but it acts as a dead weight on productivity in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms, according to PwC, will benefit over 124,000 workersâto be honest, I think that number is set conservatively lowâwho currently work across borders and will no longer have additional fees associated with their licences or registrations. In addition, an additional 44,000 workers are expected to work across borders following these reforms. I can think of many in my communities who speak to me regularly about simply not quoting on work across the border, because they'd never gotten around to being registered. I think about the many border communities in my electorate and what they went through during COVID-19 because of state border restrictions, and I don't think we have a deep enough appreciation for much of, nor have we seen the full impact of, that psychological sequelae. I'm so pleased that this legislation will provide a direct benefit to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support this bill. It's a winner for those of us that represent cross-border communities. It's a win for common sense. Let's hope we see many more reforms like this because of the architecture that has established itself at the prime ministerial and first-minister levels as a result of COVID. May that be the silver lining on this dark COVID cloud. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:26</span>):  It takes a particular kind of arrogance and incompetence to take a really good idea and turn it into something that's a potential threat to people's safety, but that's what the government has done with this bill, the Mutual Recognition Amendment Bill 2021. It's a good idea in principle to say that people in this country should have the right to move in between states and take their qualifications with them; I think you'd find most people would agree with that. But when you go below that level of principle and work out how to make it happen you can immediately see that there are some issues that have to be worked through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you're an electrician, the rules that apply, the standards that apply and the kinds of equipment that applyâvoltages and work practicesâmight in fact differ from state to state. Indeed, they may differ potentially even from region to region. That is why at the moment, in many respects, there are state systems of registration and understanding and state levels of training. If you're a teacher, you can very readily see that, because the state governments have so much responsibility for our schoolsâthey set the curriculum and put in place standards to deal with the safety of students and of staff that work thereâtraining in one state might not be automatically applicable to another state. That is why, over many years, the bodies and the people that work in this areaâelectricians, teachers, othersâhave put some thought into how you get the right balance to make sure not only that people can move between states but also that public safety and welfare are not compromised. In the electrical industry, mutual recognitionâthat's the technical termâarrangements already exist. But they take into account those very important issues of safety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also important to understand that the registration system we're talking about here isn't just a licence to work for the worker; it is also in many respects a guarantee for the public. You presume that, if someone is a registered builder or electrician in your state, they're trained to a certain standard and that that work is going to meet a certain quality. That's why, in those industries in particular, they've said that when you move from one state to another there are certain things that have to be complied with in order to have your licence recognised from one state to the nextâin part because it's about protection for the public.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You will find universal agreement on the idea that people should be able to work across the different states of Australia. What you will also find, if you bother to lookâwhich the government clearly hasn'tâis that the people who are doing the work at the moment and who understand the systems of registration and licensing have put some effort into making sure that you can do it in a way that promotes mobility but doesn't compromise other standards, including standards that protect public safety. So if you wanted to bring a bill to this place that allowed people to move across Australia but also protected standards, you could probably do it. But you'd start by sitting down and talking with the workers and the unions and the employers and the regulators who work in this industry to make sure that you are lifting everyone up to the best standard rather than allowing a race to the bottom</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the government has come along with a special kind of arrogance and complete incomprehension and taken a really good idea and turned it into something that could be a threat to peoples' safety. What they've come along and said is that this will work in a really simplistic way where, even if there are particular standards applying in your state that are about protecting the public or ensuring that work is done to a certain standard, you no longer have to comply with them. The problem with the way the government has done it is that it's going to encourage a race to the bottom. It will mean that, provided you're registered in one state, it automatically applies to another state even if that other state has got higher standards. So the state and territory governments, who've got the responsibility for looking after their people and ensuring that all electrical work or building work, for example, is done according to a certain standard, or that teaching meets certain standards, are now going to have that potentially undercut.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why what the government needs to do is take this bill back to the drawing board and go and talk to the people who work in the industry and who understand the system of regulations so that we can have a system of mutual recognition that works for people so that they can cross bordersâbecause that's what we all do in this countryâbut that also doesn't undermine the standards that are put in place at the state and territory level to protect people. It is good that there are amendments being moved. We will support those amendments to ensure that areas like the electrical industry and construction industry, where so many issues of safety are at play, are exempt from this. But we should go further because the bill can't be supported in its current form.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The teachers union made a very important point in their submission on the draft exposure billâthat this will have a negative impact on children's right to quality and safe education. Their submission, that it's an ill-conceived, unsolicited, redundant and untargeted regulatory intervention, is absolutely right. And it's of a piece with the government's response to the COVID crisis. The government see a crisis and, in that, an opportunity to pursue their trickle-down deregulatory agenda. We've seen that with their removal of the protections consumers have against bad behaviour by big corporations and directors and executives. That's exactly what they've tried to do on that front. We have seen it with their approach to handing out billions of dollars in corporate welfare in the hope that somehow it will trickle down to jobs. But it isn't and it won't. Instead public money is being used to help billionaires buy private jets. And we're seeing it here as well. The last speaker said, 'Wouldn't it be great if, coming out of the COVID crisis, there's a silver lining from that dark cloudâand this bill is it.' No, it's not. This bill is using the COVID crisis as an excuse to do something that could potentially undermine standards, public safety and peoples' right to a good education across the countryâand that's what the people who are involved in the sector say.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill can't be supported in its current form. The government needs to go away and redraft it, in consultation with the people who are going to be affected, and then come back. I come back to this point: I suspect that you would find universal agreement across this place on the idea that, with qualification, people should be able to move across borders. But you do that by either lifting everyone up to the best standard or by encouraging a race to the bottom. This bill is encouraging a race to the bottom. It's got big problems. It has been rushed here and it should not be rushed through this place. If the government insists on putting it through in its current form, it can't be supported as it is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens will be supporting the amendments that will be moved, but we need to go further because we have an opportunity here to deliver something really good for the community, something that will maintain standards, maintain public safety and also allow people to move across states with their qualifications, but this bill ain't it. The government seems to have an allergy to talking to workers, talking to representatives of workers and talking to regulators who might actually know more about this than the government itself does. If we withdraw this bill, go back to the drawing board, come back with something that isn't about a race to the bottom but is rather about lifting standards to the top, then I suspect it will be supported and it will probably sail through this place. But, as it is, we can't support something that potentially poses a threat to peoples' welfare and peoples' safety and also threatens to undermine standards in this country.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:35</span>):  I rise in support of the Mutual Recognition Amendment Bill 2021. Before I came into this place, I was a builder for 10 years, a qualified carpenter and joiner. I then went back and did a law degree and ended up practising in construction law. I have been intricately involved in the building industry for the last 32 years, either as a hands-on builder or as a building lawyer. I have reviewed a number of pieces of legislation on behalf of the Queensland government and written a number of reports for the Queensland government. As much as I often in this place pay the Queensland government out at every opportunity, I will not pay them out in relation to their licensing scheme in the building industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that the way that we administer occupational licensing, whether it be for carpenters and joiners or for just about any other trade or business or profession, is very different between the states and territories. We are still a collection of six colonies when it comes to occupational licensing and that's to our regret. When it comes to the building industry, Queensland has, in my considered view, the best licensing scheme for those in the building industry, bar none. We know that there are other states that certainly take a lesser approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've heard members opposite, and indeed the member for Melbourne, talk earlier about a race to the bottom. If this were a race to the bottom, I would be opposing the bill. I have fought all my professional life for better standards in the building industry. It's very important that we, I believe, have the best standards for occupational trades in this country. We've seen what can go wrong in the last few years with some of our building failures in New South Wales and in the ACT. What we don't want to see are those sorts of building failures and shoddy building practices being replicated in other states, and this bill would not permit that. I'll come back to that in a moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just talk briefly about the merits of this bill in the first instance. I've heard speakers before me talk about the merits of deregulation. A New South Welsh person doesn't need a Victorian drivers licence when they drive into Victoria, and most Australians would understand that is a good thing. We live in a federation. We want to try, as best as we humanly possibly can, to provide all avenues for businesses to be able to engage in work around the entire country. I don't think that anybody would quibble with that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's particularly so when we, as a country, are clawingâsome would say rapidly, in factâour way out of this pandemic, from an economic perspective. We need to provide as many opportunities as we can for businesses to compete on a national and, indeed, a global scale. But we'll start with the national scale. We need to encourage Victorian buildersâin fact, we'll need Victorian builders operating in New South Wales. One of the beautiful aspects of this bill, particularly in times of recovery from natural disasters, is that we can surge workforces. When there's a natural disaster in New South Wales, as we've seen, and in my home state and my own home area of South-East Queensland, the reality is that we don't have enough trades to surge workforces without calling upon other states. We've all seen the way that works, say, with the CFA or the SES; we always call upon other states. The same thing happens in the building industry: when we have a major flood, fire or a cyclone we call upon practitionersâoccupational licenseesâfrom other states to come and help us out. So the concept is not foreign and it's a sensible one. The concept will open up opportunities for occupational licensees around the country. These are sensible provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to return to the concerns that have been raised by those opposite in wanting to refer this matter to a Senate inquiry. They say that's because there are concerns that some states don't have the same requirements of those practitioners and that having this automatic mutual recognition scheme would somehow lead to a race to the bottom. That argument would have some merit but for the fact that section 42S provides a ministerâno, let's talk examples because it's probably easier that way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's take commercial builders operating in New South Wales. I think it's pretty well accepted that commercial builders in New South Wales do not need the same sort of rigour or to meet the same standards as commercial builders in Queensland, reiterating my views earlier that Queensland has the highest licensing standards of all the states. If Mick de Brenni, who is the Queensland minister responsible at this point in time, believed that the licensing requirements for New South Wales commercial builders were unsatisfactory in allowing them to operate as commercial builders in Queensland he could exempt those builders from operating in Queensland. Section 42S of this bill enables him to do that and I accept that he may well do that in certain instancesâI just use that as an example for the sake of argument. Mick de Brenni, the Queensland minister responsible for the Queensland Building and Construction Commission, could exempt New South Wales commercial builders from taking a commercial building licence or acting as commercial builders in Queensland if he were of the view that allowing those practitioners to operate in Queensland would be injurious to consumer protection, or the environment, or animal welfare or the health or safety of workers or the public.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That same principle applies across all of the occupational trades, whether it be electricians, plumbers or carpenters. If a state minister was of the view that a particular trade in another state or territory did not meet the same standards then the minister could exclude that trade from operating in Queensland, for example. That's really important because, as the member for Melbourne spoke about earlier, not only does that eliminate the race to the bottom but it does the oppositeâit encourages those states that do have lax licensing standards of their occupational trades to lift their game. I can assure you that, if occupational trades in a particular state or territory are made exempt by Queensland, for example, those occupational trades will be onto their own state government to lift the licensing requirements and to lift the standards so that they can compete on the national stage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This will have the absolute opposite effect to what those members opposite are arguing. It will not be a race to the bottom; it will lift the standards of all occupational trades. That would be a very good thing in my world, in the building industry, in particular, but also across all occupational trades. No-one would quibble with lifting the bar rather than lowering the bar. Whether it's the building industry, the teaching profession or whatever it might be, we should all be aspiring to look at nation's best practice. I have been a practitioner in the building industry for the last 32-odd years and I can guarantee you that Queensland has the best licensing standards. I know it's not perfect. No system designed, facilitated or administered by a human being is perfect, but it's the best there is in the country. All the other states and territories will be encouraged by this bill to lift their standards to ensure that residents in their state can compete on the national stage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I haven't heard all of the debate in this place, but I imagine that, if someone hasn't done it already, someone will raise the argument: what's to stop a resident of Queensland who can't meet the tough licensing standards from applying for their builders licence, their electricians licence or their carpenters licence in another state or territory that has lax standards and saying in their home state: 'I've got my licence from another state. I now want to operate as a builder in this state'? Again, section 42A of this bill prevents people from doing that. Under section 42A of the bill you cannot have your principal place of residence or operate a business in, say, the state of Queensland and get your licence in Victoria, New South Wales, Tassie or the ACT. If you're a resident of Queenslandâin that you have your principal place of residence in Queenslandâor you operate your business in Queensland, that's where you have to get your licence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are really sensible reforms. I totally get that those members opposite have some concerns. We don't want to lower the bar. I want to assure you that this is not lowering the bar. This bill has been considered. These concerns around lifting things up rather than lowering them down are contained in the bill. No-one wants to see repeats of the shoddy building work that we've seen in apartments in New South Wales. We don't want to see that replicated across Australia; no-one would.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill would protect, under section 42A and 42S, from that sort of conduct. It's a sensible bill. It would enable contractors and occupational trades to operate without having to get individual licences in every state. That's a good thing. That's a sensible thing. I'm still a registered builder in Queensland and it costs me $600 or $700 a year. I don't want to have to pay that in every state and territory in this country. This bill will prevent that from happening. It's sensible. I recommend it to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cooper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:52</span>):  I rise to speak on the Mutual Recognition Amendment Bill 2021. The bill seeks to introduce a uniform scheme of automatic mutual recognition. Automatic mutual recognition will allow workers to move across states or territories and bring with them their accreditation to work in their trade or profession. This legislation is backed by an intergovernmental agreement for automatic mutual recognition with all states and territories consenting to the bill. But, as we have heard, there are major concerns with this bill as it stands. Labor's position here is clear. We support the principle of allowing workers to move around the country in pursuit of work and have their qualifications recognised via a mutual recognition scheme. However, the Labor Party will initiate two mechanisms to make this legislation better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We intend to refer this bill to a Senate inquiry. Stakeholders have noted some concerns with the legislation, including issues with differing compliance and regulatory responsibilities in each jurisdiction and the possibility that this legislation may well remove the incentive for jurisdictions to introduce uniform workplace standards. As we've heard here this morning, the last thing we want is a race to the bottom when it comes to standards. A Senate inquiry will allow for these concerns to be discussed and add changes that can make the bill better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The shadow minister will move a substantive amendment which seeks to exclude electrical and construction workers from this bill. This is a sensible amendment that can be done right now. The bill doesn't remove differences in standards between the electrical and construction industries in different states. It just ignores those differences as if they're not there and treats all states the same, but, despite that, the differences still exist. Mutual recognition has existed since the early nineties. There is already mutual recognition for many occupations and moving to automatic mutual recognition for many occupations does make sense. Many different industries have worked hard to standardise the laws for their particular occupations since mutual recognition laws commenced. Getting as many occupations in Australia as possible to that same position is good policy and is something we need to see states and territories working towards. Regrettably, that national standard has not been achieved for some occupations. The electrical occupations are one of those. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want to standardise occupational outcomes in the country, the first thing that needs to happen is that state and territory rules have to be standardised across those occupations. That is the first step. You have to lift all state and territories to the highest possible standard, one that's recognised and endorsed by the industry. When I say 'industry', I mean all representations of the industryâthat is, employers, unions and their members, government and even the training institutions who train people to meet those standards. Instead, what we see here is an attempt by the government to bypass all that hard work and bypass what is going to make standardisation across the country possible to then take that last step of automatic mutual recognition. The government calls all of that hard work, all of this trouble, red tape. They pooh-pooh it. I call it blue ribbon. This is blue ribbon that wraps around working people to make sure they come home safe at the end of each day and to make sure the consumers are also wrapped around and kept safe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those industries that have already achieved this level of standardisation, making mutual recognition automatic makes perfect sense. My profession, the nursing profession, has gone through this process. It took years. The industry, as I described before, worked together. We set standards right across the board. In fact, the trade union, the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation, of which I was national secretary and of which I am still a very proud member, played a very leading role in that process. It took years and years to actually write the standards that levelled across the whole country the requirements for someone to practice as a nurse. Once we did that hard workâand I'm proud to say the ANMF actually owned the copyright on those standards and the bill of ethics and the code of conduct for a long timeâthat was then handed over to the national body. All that work was given to the national body and all those individual nurses boards became one under Ahpra.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the proper way to do this. For those industries that have already achieved that level, automatic mutual recognition absolutely makes sense. But you have to do that work first. For a small number of occupations, this work hasn't been done. This bill means there could be very dangerous outcomes for consumers. There could be unacceptable safety risks for workers and it could put members of the public in danger. Those occupations that have achieved this standardisation, as I said, followed a very clear path. The automatic mutual recognition proposal, as it is here, does the opposite for some occupations to what I just described. It ignores all the very significant differences that currently exist between states and territoriesâdifferences in qualifications and training, differences in licences, differences in laws that they practice under, differences in standards that need to be achieved to get a qualification and differences in industry application. These are important things. They're not just things that you can ignore and hope go away because you've introduced a bill that says, 'Hey, there's mutual recognition across the country now; let's forget about all those differences.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill says: 'Regardless of what you need to know, just go and do what you want in each place and we're not going to do the work behind it that is going to make it safe for you to do your job. By the way, if you do step in there not knowing what the rules are, not knowing what the regulations are and not knowing what the requirements are and something goes wrong, it's all your fault.' It is all very well for the previous member to say, 'But the minister can stop you working there if they think it is not going to be right,' but this bill doesn't allow, in any way, for people working in different states to even know that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is electrical occupations already have a mutual recognition system in place, and it's working. It's a system that maximises portability of skills but balances that portability against the risks that come from not having standards set across states and territories. The government's proposal removes the existing system of balancing those risks for electrical occupations and replaces it with a scheme that ignores them. It's interesting to watch this process unfold here with the government's bill, because there really is no recognition from the government that unions have an important role to play in all these issues.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ETU, the Electrical Trades Union, is playing an exceptionally sensible role here. I thank them for their hard work in highlighting the problems with this bill. They want to unite the trades across the country. They want to develop the best universal standards that they can to protect their workers and consumers and develop the best outcomes for all. They are at the coalface. Their members are the ones working on these sites. Their members have an intricate knowledge of the issues at hand.</span>

The amendments are sensible, and I ask the House to support them.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282335" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HAINES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:00</span>):  I rise to speak briefly on the Mutual Recognition Amendment Bill 2021 as the proud representative of the thriving cross-border community of Albury-Wodonga and the surrounding areas. When I ask my constituents about this bill, they say the same thing: this is common sense. Border residents will tell you common sense is not too common when it comes to the New South Wales and Victorian border. We're still reeling from the COVID border closure where the New South Wales border slammed shut in July last year, cutting our families in two, cutting our economy in two, and the economic aftershocks continue to eat away at us. I was told only yesterday by the mayor of Wodonga, Kevin Poulton, that Victor's Restaurant &amp; Events, a mainstay on the Lincoln Causeway is shutting up shop for good. His business was decimated by blow after blow inflicted by city politicians playing to a city audience. They still see the country as a backwater at the margins, and our community was caught in the crossfire. And the emotional toll is still there. My constituents remain fragile, struggling and uncertain about whether a border can slam shut again. That's why I'm enthusiastic about welcoming this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Albury-Wodonga is one of the main places that will benefit. This reform introduces an automatic mutual recognition scheme that makes it cheaper, easier and faster for people who work in registered occupations to work in multiple states. This applies to tradies of all stripesâelectricians, plumbers, builders, architects, real estate agents and many more. In Albury-Wodonga alone, technicians and trade workers are the second largest professional class, making up 15.6 per cent of the population. You'd be hard pressed to find a tradie in Wodonga who doesn't do jobs across the border and vice versa. It's a fact of life. It's how our businesses operate. But these workers need to apply for two registrations to do this workâone in Victoria, one in New South Walesâand this can cost in the hundreds or thousands of dollars, and it's a real red tape nightmare that we simply don't need in a border community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It must be said at this point though that I haven't heard tradies screaming out for this change. In honesty, that's because they're used to it and they just get on with it; they put up with. It's what you have to do in business if you live on the border. It's what you have to do to survive. Registering in two states is one of the dozens of inconveniences that living under two sets of rules creates for every person every single day in a border community. But city tradies don't have to pay twice the number of application registrations or renewal fees like my constituents. And all they're asking for, all I'm asking for, is fairness, and this is what this scheme will deliver.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A huge number of people in my area cross the border every single day for work. They live in one state and work in another. In 2016, over 20 per cent of people who worked in Albury lived in Wodonga. In the Indigo Shire, 14 per cent of people in towns like Beechworth, Yackandandah, Rutherglen and Chiltern cross the border for work. Our labour market is very mobile and they move to follow the work. In these times, when the economy is jumping around, with the end of JobKeeper only days away, we need to slash every bit of red tape that might prevent them from taking up new opportunities so as to not sink their confidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For tradies moving to the border from Melbourne, this change can't come quick enough. We're seeing a huge influx of people from the city seeking a better life in our region, and they want to hit the ground running, but, for most, it will be the first time they've worked in a second state. Stephen Donaghey, the regional manager of the Master Builders Association of Victoria, flagged this with me as an issue. He told my office that it can take up to 12 weeks to apply for and then receive a New South Wales registration, which means that, if you've got a job tomorrow, you can't go to work. Imagine how much work they could miss out on. It's not a good start to life in the country. By making the ability to work automatic, they don't need to complete a form a dozen pages long, they don't need to pay hundreds or thousands of dollars in registration fees and they don't need to wait for months for the tick of approval. They can just get on with it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This change also promises to make it easier for a surge capacity to rebuild communities after natural disasters. The bushfires of 2019 destroyed many thousands of hectares of prime countryside and devastated houses and buildings. Many people wanted to help out to rebuild, and we had hundreds of volunteers on the ground building fences, bulldozing and rebuilding houses from the ground up. The last thing you want to do is greet this goodwill with a 10-page stack of paperwork.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill has the backing of peak groups in my community, who I speak to regularly about issues affecting our small-business sector. Neil Aird of Business Wodonga, which represents the interests of thousands of businesses, is very confident that this move will be widely supported by the members. And Steve Donaghey and Ross Mitchell of Master Builders have thrown their support behind the reform, with some words of caution. I'm grateful to them for their time to discuss this reform and for their explanations about how it will play out in practice. However, they did have some concerns about the bill and how it will be implemented, which I've raised with the assistant minister, and I'd like to thank him and his office for their time in clarifying its operation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In regard to obtaining state based warranty insurance, I've been reassured that insurance providers will not require either Victorian or New South Wales registration in order to obtain cover in each state. Having the single registration will be enough, and it will be recognised as such. I'm also pleased that there are measures in place to prevent licence shopping, which has been raised as a concern for both consumer safety and the integrity of the professions. Noting that Victoria and New South Wales have different continuing professional development obligations, I call on the government to really consider making these requirements more uniform, too. Significant information will need to be provided to people who are working in occupations about what work they can and can't perform in the second state. For instance, in Victoria the domestic builder registration allows builders to carry out work in classes 1a, 1b, 2, 4 and 10; in New South Wales, 1b is not termed 'domestic'. We need clear guidelines for each state about what people in each state can do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thinking through this bill has brought back painful memories of the permit system that was in place for six months or more on the very same border that this reform seeks to address. The New South Wales premier shut the border with very little notice and promised that there would be a permit system. When we woke up to a closed border, the permit system was a complete shambles. We saw police checkpoints and constant queues that made people hours late for work, if they were able to get to work at all. Businesses were shuttered, never to return. People's lives were completely torn up. Before then, the border was simply a bridge you drove over to do your shopping, go to school, run your business or get to hospital. Now it's a barrier that could close at any time without notice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the government slowly added postcodes to the list of border communities over the months following that closure, it was extremely clear that they had no idea how border communities work. And what we see across governments is a profound lack of understanding of how people like us live on the border and how interconnected our communities are. There is no shortage of cross-border problems that we face every day. They cause everything from headaches to heartbreakâroad rules and anomalies that learner and probationary drivers deal with when crossing the border, different certificates for the responsible service of alcohol in every state, healthcare provision that stops at the border, the availability of the services under the NDIS, and bushfire apps. I could go on and on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The New South Wales and Victorian cross-border commissioners were created to work through these issues, and during the border closure they did a mighty fine job at it. I want to pay tribute to their work. But there's still so much work to be done when it comes to border anomalies. I welcome the assistant minister's invitation for ongoing discussions about how we can further reduce these barriers to bring our cross-border community back together again, stronger than ever, after this traumatic year of separation.</span>

The Mutual Recognition Amendment Bill 2021 introduces a uniform scheme for the automated mutual recognition, or AMR, of occupational registrations. AMR allows builders, plumbers, architects and other registered professionals to do the same work in other states that they are licensed to do at home, without applying for additional licences or paying further fees. Safeguards are embedded in the bill to maintain high standards of consumer and environmental protection and animal welfare. The health and safety of workers and of the public will also be protected. Workers will face oversight by local regulators, and anyone who is subject to disciplinary action will be excluded from the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">AMR is an important national reform that will increase the resilience of the Australian economy, contributing to economic and jobs growth. The scheme reduces the burden of regulation on businesses and workers. AMR will particularly benefit workers in cross-border regions and help communities to respond and rebuild following natural disasters. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I articulated in my substantive speech in relation to the bill proper, Labor is moving amendments to seek the exclusion of those licensed occupations which operate in the building industry from the application of this bill, given the varying forms of regulation that exist in relation to those licenses. It's important that, as we move forward with this bill, as laudable as the principle is, there aren't unintended consequences in relation to the health and safety of those working in these industries, along with the outcome of their work and the benefit to consumers. To that end, Labor seeks to move the amendments that I have just done.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Franklin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:25</span>):  I want to be clear that Labor does not intend to hold this bill up. Of course we understand the biosecurity risks that could impact on our vital agricultural industry in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As outlined in the explanatory memorandum and by the minister just then, the purpose of the Biosecurity Amendment (Clarifying Conditionally Non-prohibited Goods) Bill 2021 is to amend the Biosecurity Act 2015. The amendments clarify the validity of determinations made under subsection 174(1) of the act in relation to specifying that certain classes of goods are conditionally non-prohibited goods. According to the explanatory memorandum, conditionally non-prohibited goods are goods specified in a determination in force under subsection 174A of the act. That provides that the Director of Biosecurity and the Director of Human Biosecurity may jointly determine that the specified classes of goods must not be brought or imported into Australian territory unless specified conditions are complied with. The explanatory memorandum also outlines the conditionality that non-prohibited goods pose an unacceptable level of biosecurity risk if specified conditions are not complied with. Determinations made under 174(1) of the act therefore play a central role in enabling the government to manage biosecurity risks and to prevent goods which present an unacceptable level of biosecurity risk from being brought or imported into Australian territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note that the explanatory memorandum states the bill would not have any financial impact on the Australian government's budget, but I do want to take the opportunity to raise a number of concerns in relation to the Morrison government's current management of Australia's biosecurity system. We're here today doing this amendment because the government have asked us to, to fix up the original drafting errors. My understanding is that the government currently have a whole heap of situations whereby they're relying on this determination, which they've now found might not be valid. So we're here today to fix this up for the government because they didn't draft it properly in the first place. That's what's going on here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that Australia's biosecurity system underpins more than $60 billion in agricultural production and $45 billion in agriculture exports, as well as $38 billion in relation to the country's inbound tourism industry. Biosecurity is always an issue raised whenever I talk to Australia's farmers, producers and growers right around the country. They, like us, know that there's a lot at risk if the government isn't adequately managing our biosecurity system. But this government hasn't had a good track record when it comes to biosecurity arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've already seen the Morrison government axe its biosecurity levy, a levy that its own reportâthe Craik review in 2017ârecommended. The report included 42 recommendations and found that our biosecurity system was underfunded, therefore recommending the introduction of a new biosecurity imports levy. The review into Australia's biosecurity system found it was also at risk of failing without additional resources. Interestingly, the government budgeted for this levy to be introduced back in the 2018-19 budget but missed a number of deadlines to introduce it and has axed it totally, never to be seen again. But, of course, it did say that it was going to spend the $300-odd million that this biosecurity levy was going to raise. We tried to find out about what's actually going on with those programs. At the time the levy was axed, the National Farmers Federation criticised the government and said that axing the levy was a blow to Australian farmers and that it was a poor look for the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was also the Inspector-General of Biosecurity's review report for 2021. This report revealed that biosecurity is not in a strong position to address the diverse and evolving biosecurity risks and business environment expected to prevail in 2021 through to 2025. With so much at risk for Australia's agriculture sector, this is certainly a wake-up call for the Morrison government. It must do better when it comes to our biosecurity arrangements. There must be confidence in Australia's biosecurity system given that it protects the agricultural industry from pests and disease. Of course, we saw the human biosecurity system fail when the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruby Princess</span> docked in Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic. The government must do better when it comes to the biosecurity systems for agriculture and for humans in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know there are other factors and issues impacting on the agricultural sector across Australia, ones that the government has done little or nothing to fix. It knows they are impacting today on Australian farmers. For example, the government has known there is a structural reliance on migrant workers to pick produce on Australian farms for a very long time. The COVID-19 pandemic further highlighted this structural reliance given the travel and quarantine arrangements over the last year. Labor has written to the minister twice, first in January and then in February this year, to raise our concerns around the agricultural workforce strategy. The minister promised to fix it during the COVID-19 pandemic. The minister claimed he had 25,000 prevetted work-ready islanders ready to come to Australia. But last week he confessed only 2,600 have entered Australia to pick the produce. The minister promised these workers were ready to go but clearly they are not and they haven't been delivered. It is one of those classic Morrison government marketing momentsâall announcement, no delivery. There are not 25,000 prevetted workers available on Australian farms. We know this because our produce is still rotting on Australian farms because there are not enough workers to pick it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is clear is that the minister's turned his back on the Seasonal Worker Program and on the quarantine arrangements, which are the responsibility of the government. We know the COVID pandemic has contributed to a shortage of 26,000 workers across Australian farms. The Morrison government has been long aware of these structural issues with the agricultural workforce. The government has a report on its desk asking it to fix this. John Azarias, through the agricultural labour advisory committee, delivered the national agricultural workforce strategy to the minister back in October last year. Almost five months later, the government finally released the report together with another road map. It had 37 recommendations in it, but the government is saying in the media release that it will respond to the strategy in the coming months. It had already had the report for five months sitting on its desk before it released it. It was to address the immediate needs of our farmers, but clearly the government is not responding to immediate needs. The report sat on a desk for five months, and now the government is saying it is going to do months of consultation. This is simply not good enough.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Lost Crop Register indicates that $45 million of fruit and vegetables have been dumped in Australia to date. That figure would be much higher if everybody were reporting their losses. It is an absolute national shame for farmers, after what happened with the bushfires and the drought in previous years. Now they have had some good weather. Unfortunately, they have had too much rain in the last few days but, prior to that, they had a bumper crop and they can't actually get that produce out to Australians and receive its value. It's just demoralising for Australia's primary producers.</span>

It is clear from the experts that the Morrison government has more work to do to make sure our biosecurity system is well resourced and that it does not fail. Labor will be keeping a close eye on how the government continues to manage our vital biosecurity system. Labor will be moving a second reading amendment to reflect our ongoing concern about the inaction of the Morrison government. I therefore move:</span>

When the <span style="font-style:italic;">Our north, our future: white paper on developing northern Australia</span> was released back in 2015, it made big promises to turbocharge growth and to create jobs right across the region. The white paper's biggest announcementâits crowning jewel, if you likeâwas supposed to be the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, which is now widely referred to as the 'no actual infrastructure fund'. The NAIF was intended to offer another avenue for projects which are a bit out of the norm and may not have qualified for traditional bank loans but offer great opportunities for innovation and job creation across northern Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Northern Australia may be geographically remote, but it is home to a number of world-class, world-leading businesses and industries. There are organisations from Mackay to Darwin to Port Hedland that are achieving things that no-one else has even dreamed of doing in mining, in agriculture and in sustainability. With the right support, we can see more emerge, and this will help Australia in its post-COVID, post-recession recovery. Unfortunately, what we've seen over the past five years, since it was established, is that the NAIF has been a huge disappointment for the communities in northern Australia and has comprehensively failed to deliver what was promised back in 2015.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government are always happy to talk about how much they have approved or how much they're going to spend eventually from the NAIF, but they go really silent when you ask them how much has actually gone out the door and into communities. There's probably a good reason they don't like to talk about that. As of 30 October 2020, NAIF had only realised $218.4 million of its $5 billion budget. That means that only 5c in every dollar promised has been released over the five-year period supposed to be the NAIF's entire life span. When the coalition government established the NAIF, it believed it could invest $5 billion in five years. Northern Australia is overflowing with potential projects, so it seemed like it should be an easy job. So how is it the government managed to make such a dog's breakfast of it, with only five per cent of funding out the door by the time its deadline rolled around? How? If it were a private business, serious questions would have to be asked about the NAIF's ability to hit its KPIs. So far, we have seen fewer than 10 projects actually begin or complete construction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the government gave the NAIF an extension, another five years to roll out the other 95 per cent of its funding. It's clear there is a big job for this 'announce lots, deliver nothing' government. The NAIF has also been subject to four reviews in as many years, with the Senate Select Committee on the effectiveness of the Australian Government's Northern Australia agenda also making it the subject of its interim report. It is no wonder that people in northern Australia see it as a white elephant, with review after review, announcement after announcement and recommendations made and gone unheard and northern Australia still seeing very little development. All of this inaction has meant people are still waiting to get any real results.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor have been calling for major changes to the NAIF for the past three years. Finally, at the end of last year, we saw the Morrison government admit its failures and commit to a much-needed overhaul of the program. Labor welcome the Morrison government finally making changes to the NAIFâchanges we hope, when implemented, will be a step in the right direction. People in northern Australia don't want another announcement from the Prime Minister and Minister Pitt; they actually want delivery. They want money out the door from this program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill proposes to extend the time period in which NAIF can make decisions to grant financial assistance for another five years beyond its current expiry of 30 June 2021 to 30 June 2026. The NAIF's statutory review showed stakeholder support for the extension of the NAIF based on the view that it fills an ongoing market gap in accessing finance in northern Australia. Labor supports the proposed extension. Northern Australia is bursting with opportunity, with many project proponents just needing that hand up to get started. Hopefully, the government will make better use of the next five years than they did the previous five.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also proposes to expand the activities eligible for financial assistance beyond the construction of northern Australia economic infrastructure to the development of northern Australia economic infrastructure. This change is consistent with the recommendations of the Senate inquiry that the NAIF should support more smaller projects. It means the NAIF could potentially support the purchase of equipment, leasing, training and the expansion of existing business operations. The Senate inquiry into the effectiveness of the Australian government's northern Australia agenda repeatedly heard from stakeholders across the north that the NAIF was not accessible to smaller projects and that it is, a lot of the time, smaller projects that have the largest impact on communities and jobs in the north. It's always exciting to hear about $100 million projects being approved in our regions, but often it is those smaller projects that can make a big difference in communities because they can be completed more quickly and they deliver ongoing jobs faster. It's hoped allowing more of these smaller projects to prosper through the scheme will help deliver the results desperately needed to get the NAIF back on the right path.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also provides for the NAIF to lend directly to project proponents rather than going through state and territory governments, as it must now. Feedback from across the north has raised serious concerns about the length of time it currently takes to get money out of the NAIF by duplicating administrative processes at the state or territory level. We acknowledge the concerns raised by environment groups that the changes would remove the ability of state or territory governments to block projects that have environmental impacts, in particular gas projects. However, the Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia governments, as well as business groups across the north, have all indicated that they are comfortable with this change. In addition, the bill does not alter existing federal, state or territory environmental and other regulatory processes relevant to projects that are funded by the NAIF. Labor supports speeding up the release of funding for the NAIF. However, we would like to see the NAIF support more renewable energy projects and projects which assist in achieving net zero by 2050 targets, as is Labor's own policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also broadens the types of financial assistance which the NAIF will be able to provide to projects. Currently, the NAIF only provides loans. The bill proposes that, in addition to loans, the NAIF be permitted to offer letters of credit, purchase of bonds, guarantees and equity investments. This reflects the investment options of other government financing bodies such as the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. Labor has been calling for this change for a while now, with the Senate inquiry and the statutory review stating that other types of finance would be of assistance to potential projects in northern Australiaâespecially smaller projects and those proposed by First Nations communities, which historically have had an extremely difficult time receiving support by the NAIF.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As of 30 October 2020, only two First Nations projects have reached investment decision stage with the NAIF. These two decisions total $40 million, representing only one per cent of the NAIF's total funding. That's just not acceptable. Labor has been calling on the government, and the NAIF, to work on having greater engagement with First Nations communities on the development of northern Australia. We acknowledge that this bill goes some way towards addressing this by including experience in economic development for Indigenous communities in the list of fields of expertise sought for the NAIF board. Labor had hoped the bill may go further in addressing the challenges First Nations projects seeking NAIF support have faced in accessing NAIF financing. However, we hope that, altogether, these changes will mean that smaller projects and First Nations projects, which are so vital to development in northern Australia, will have more opportunities to successfully progress through the NAIF.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last 18 months have been particularly challenging for northern Australia. It has seen drought, fire, floods, trade embargoes and COVID-19. It has battled a lot of this without real meaningful help from this government, who time and time again seem to believe that this country stops at Kirribilli when it comes to planning those big projects. Areas like Far North Queensland, relying on JobKeeper and JobSeeker, have been hit badly by the government's recent cuts and in four short days will bear the brunt of the JobKeeper program ending altogether. For many people in the north this means less money for essentials, less money spent in local shops, meaning the north's recession will bite deeper and longer than it should.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why it is more important than ever that we see the Prime Minister, Minister Pitt and the NAIF start truly supporting northern Australia. Now is the time to be supporting big and small projects alike to get off the ground, employing people from local communities and stimulating those local economies. It's easy to lose count of how many reviews and rehashes of programs the government has announced for northern Australia in the last few years. Time after time this government talks about the north's potential but what it doesn't seem to understand is that people in the north are looking for action to actually realise that potential. A strong northern Australia is good for the whole economy and the whole country. If we want the north to lead the country out of recession, it's going to take more than unfulfilled promises. Northern Australians are fighters and they deserve a federal government who will join them, support them and invest in what the north has to offer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of this bill, the government will now get a second chance with the NAIF and another five years to spend the funds that it promised the north. Labor wants the NAIF to work. We want to see northern Australia reach its full potential. Let's hope this bill won't end up as just another example of this government overpromising and underdelivering. Northern Australia needs long-term vision but it also needs projects and jobs now. If our economy is to recover from COVID-19, the last thing they want to see is a repeat of the last five years. Communities in the north can't spend another five years waiting on funding to trickle down from the NAIF. Money must start getting out the door faster so it can start turbocharging northern Australia's recession recovery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've already said, northern Australia is bursting with opportunity. It's now up to the minister and his colleagues to deliver what they promised. Northern Australia has already been waiting too long for the Morrison government to catch up. It's time for action. It's time for jobs. It's time to see that the $5 billion that was promised to northern Australia way back in 2015 actually gets out the door, gets out of Canberra and makes a real, substantial and sustained difference for the north of this country.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In many ways northern Australia can be looked upon as our nation's frontier land, the vast and beautiful Top End which makes up 40 per cent of our country's land mass and yet it is home to just five per cent of the population. In terms of representation in this House, of 151 members of parliament just eight can raise their voices in this place to celebrate the worth of the north and champion its causes. In the other place there are just five senators who are actually based in northern Australia. I am very proud to say three of those five are Nationals: Senator Canavan, Senator McDonald and Senator McMahon. That's a total of 14 MPs and senators out of a total of 229 representatives and senators in this place who can actually stick their hand up for close to a third of our nation's potential. Yes, we are few in number but we have loud voices. It was only when the Liberal-National coalition came to government in 2013 that serious work began on further investigating the potential of the north and to find ways to invest in that potential.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility was a recommendation of the white paper for developing northern Australia. It set out a plan to unlock the vast economic potential of the region, as we have barely scratched the surface in untapping the wealth in terms of mineral resources, in terms of food production, in terms of water storage and in terms of tourism development. The Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility provides financing by means of low-interest loans. Since its commencement in July 2016 the NAIF, despite all that's been said in this place, has actually made a big impactâ$2.8 billion in investment commitments, forecast to support 8,000 jobs and generate around $6.6 billion in economic impact for northern Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While much has been achieved, despite the naysayers, there is more to do. I acknowledge that. I have advocated for a long, long time, probably since the inception of the NAIF, for the changes that are being announced today to be made. I and many project proponents have felt frustrated by lending requirements from the NAIF being dragged through state government and territory government processes and the time it took to get through those processes and the restriction of only funding construction. The changes contained in this amendment essentially mean that the NAIF will fund more job-creating projects in the north because the NAIF will be able to provide more and not just in finance. On finance there is a cap of $50 million per project and no more than a 50 per cent share. So the NAIF, or essentially taxpayers, won't have a controlling interest. That is fantastic news. I can think of a number of big job-creating projects that could benefit from this: the Urannah Dam project, the Bowen Marine Centre of Excellence project, the Whitsunday Skyway tourism experience project and the Collinsville coal-fired power station project.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment will expand eligibility. The NAIF was previously restricted to funding construction works only. This expansion will allow the NAIF to finance projects involving equipment purchases for leasing, training and the expansion of existing business operations. The definition of 'public benefit' is also going to be expanded to take into account factors, such as jobsâjobs being the most important thing in the northâregional income, opportunity for local suppliers, opportunity for Indigenous businesses and opportunity for communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NAIF will have an increased risk appetite, which is very important given the situation we are now in as we recover from the effects of the pandemic. We should be providing the NAIF with more flexibility to support, yes, riskier projects but bolder projects, with the potential to deliver significant economic benefit in the north. The amendment includes removing the prohibition against the Commonwealth assuming the majority of risk in any project.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another change I am pleased to see is faster lending. The NAIF will have the option to now lend directly to project proponents rather than having those loans made through states that have added, sadly, to the length of time it's taken for money to get out the door. That'll simplify the lending process and reduce the red tape burden for the project proponents. I'm also pleased to see changes to allow the NAIF to collaborate with other lending institutions to support smaller projects between $1 million and $10 million. I am already in discussions on a significant farming operation in the Burdekin about accessing some of this lower, smaller finance to enable a unique glasshouse system of horticulture to be set up. We are going to explore that further.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've heard the criticisms from the previous speaker, the member for Ballarat, as someone from New South Wales who probably doesn't know too much about the northâactually she's from Victoria; even worse than what I thought, coming from Victoria! There's not too much about the north that she knows, but I just wonder, given the criticisms that have been put in this place, whether it's understood clearly by the Labor Party that the NAIF can't just go around spraying money at projects that they like. It has to come via applications. It''s just like banks, such as the NAB, Westpac, ANZ or CBA. They can't just turn up to someone's business and say, 'Here's $5 million; we want to invest in this particular project.' That's not how banking works. Someone comes up with an idea. Someone does the work. Someone does the business case. Someone then comes to the bank, in this case the NAIF, and applies for the low-interest loan. These changes will assist in getting that money out the door, because it will make it easier for applications to come forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are quite a number of applications that have gone out. The NAIF has made close to $3 billion in investments into projects. A number of those are either in or adjacent to my electorate. In Townsville, we've got the Townsville Airport with $50 million towards an $80 million project, creating 257 jobs. I acknowledge the member for Herbert here, who is a strong supporter of that and also a strong supporter of the JCU Technology Innovation Complex, with $96 million to support a project creating 270 jobs. The mining industry is still going strong. There is a pipeline of projects that will require a larger workforce. With this JCU project, we could attract more young students into the region to secure the necessary qualifications to fill the gaps in the resources sector and other sectors, which is vitally needed. The JCU have also applied for $46 million for university student accommodation, creating 569 jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Mater Private Hospital in Townsville has secured $19 million to create a car park as part of the hospital redevelopment, helping locals ensure that they've got greater access to the hospital, with more car parking provision. That creates 14 jobs. We've got the great North Queensland Cowboysâmay they long live forever and win a lot more than they have been. The Cowboys are going to roll out a high-performance centre. There's a sports medical and allied health service with $20 million investment from the NAIF. It has a total project value of $35 million, creating 213 construction jobs and 58 ongoing operational jobs. This is real stuff.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just west of Mackay, in Claremont, we've got Signature Beef, in the member for Capricornia's electorate. She's a strong supporter of this project, as am I. They received $24 million in finance to create a beef processing facility out west of Mackay. That's going to create 270 jobs. This is real money out the door, with real jobs being created. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All in all, I'm just talking about North Queensland projects. NAIF investments are creating over 3Â½ thousand jobs from over $1.3 billion investment, and that is just in Queensland. I know there's far more potential from a number of proponents who have ideas on the table to grow the north. I welcome steps being taken to amend the NAIF so that we can see more players getting the go ahead and more jobs created in the north. Thank you.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HVO" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:59</span>):  I rise to speak on the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility Amendment (Extension and Other Measures) Bill 2021, which extends the capacity of the NAIF to provide assistance across the north of Australia. I like to read books when I'm catching a plane, often a book on history, or a biography; I find them interesting. My colleagues sometimes have a go at me for the size of the books I carry, which look like you could do weights with them! But one day on the way back from parliament to Queensland, on a Friday morning, I got hold of the report <span style="font-style:italic;">Our north, our future: white paper on developing northern Australia</span>, released in 2015, and I was pretty excited when I read it. I thought it was a pretty good report which looked at the challenges we face. With a population of just over a million north of the Tropic of Capricorn but 40 per cent of our landmass, it's not just an economic development issue; it's a national security issue and I think a social justice issue for our Indigenous brothers and sisters, who make up such a large proportion of the north of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I've got to say, this government, when they brought in the NAIF, really messed it up. They've released only $218.4 million of the $5 billion they've allocated, and of course this facility runs out in the middle of this year. So, because of the NAIF not working the way it should have worked, the government's now having to extend it for five years, change it to smaller projects, change the facility provision, bypass states and territories and even do some amendments that look like they take into consideration the experience of our Indigenous brothers and sisters in the north, so they made some important amendments. But we shouldn't have had to get to this point, because, as Labor's been sayingâand I know some opposite have said it as wellâwe should be supporting the economic development of northern Australia, the protection of its environment, which is fragile, and the empowerment of northern Australia's First Nations population. There are incredible opportunities in northern Australia, from the Northern Territory to Western Australia, the Kimberley and up in the Torres Strait, and in the major provincial cities of Queensland and the outback of Queensland. These opportunities include agriculture, tourism, biofuels, renewable energy, mining, tropical medicine and the like.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation shouldn't have been necessary, but it is, because the government has completely messed it all up, after the opportunities and the excitement that you could have experienced when reading the white paper. This government has failed northern Australia. We've seen some good governments in northern Australia, at timesâthe Queensland Labor government, the Western Australian government, who placed an enormous amount of emphasis on infrastructure, airports, ports, the establishment of supply chains, a competitive tax environment, a skilled workforce and a whole range of issues that they've addressed and are addressing. I commend the McGowan government and the Palaszczuk government for the work they've done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side we have supported the NAIF and had hoped that the government would do better, and unfortunately they have not. The member for Dawson can talk about all the projects that have been committed to, identified and thought about. But the release of the money is crucial. The member talked about the banking industry. Well, I'm telling you, you can't actually buy that house-and-land package unless the bank releases the money so that you can actually settle that and buy it. This government has not released the moneyâjust $218.4 million out of $5 billion. It has not been a good investment. That is not a good track record. You can say you're 'going towards'. You can say you're 'having discussions', or negotiations, or that you've signed a memorandum of understanding. But you've actually not got the money out the door.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, if this particular legislation will get the money out the door, Labor will support it. But it shouldn't have had to come to this. We do support another five-year extension. But there are those opposite who know, in their heart of hearts, that the government has not fulfilled the potential of the NAIF. It has been the 'no actual infrastructure facility'. They can't even be specific about the number of jobs or the amount of money they've allocated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I spoke in response to the minister's ministerial statement in October last year I pointed out that the minister said one thing on 30 September last year in terms of the money they'd committed and then another thing in terms of the jobs. By six or seven days laterâI think it was 6 October, about a week laterâthey had lost 700 jobs and $400 million. That was in his own ministerial press releases. They couldn't even get that right within seven or eight days. They couldn't even work that out. How can you lose 700 jobs and about $400 million in about seven days? This was in the minister's own press releases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government can't get the story straight. If this legislation will help them then we'll support it, but they haven't done a good job in northern Australia and they haven't done a good job on the NAIF. The fact that they have this legislation before the chamber today indicates quite clearly that they've messed up and haven't handled it well. The promises that were there with the white paper haven't been fulfilled and the government is playing catch up. I hope this works. We've been arguing for some of these things, like a more flexible approach in terms of credit facilities and also smaller projects as well. I hope the government gets this right for the sake of my home state of Queensland. It's certainly a fact that having this legislation before the chamber is an indictment on this government and a demonstration of its failure.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Leichhardt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:06</span>):  I rise in support of the Northern Australian Infrastructure Facility Amendment (Extension and Other Measures) Bill 2021.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The $5 billion Northern Australian Infrastructure Facility has certainly been a game changer for northern Australia. It was great to see this coming out of our <span style="font-style:italic;">Pivot north</span> report, as a recommendation for a funding streamâa report by the committee I chaired at the time. However, I do concede that there have been some initial teething problems. That's why we have to bring these amendments on. I notice that the member for Blair has left the chamber nowâhe wouldn't understand this because Blair is well below us, in the south-east corner, so he's not really talking about northern Australia. He would need to concede something when he talks about cooperation: the Northern Territory government, a Labor government, has been very proactive in grabbing opportunities that the NAIF has presented, and the Western Australian Labor government has also been quite proactive in grabbing opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the Queensland state Labor government have been absolutely abysmal. They have failed in every way. They have dragged their feet and done everything they can to make sure that this program hasn't been successful. Unfortunately, as a direct result of that, we've lost out on so many different opportunities in relation to this. What we're doing now reflects on the lack of interest and cooperation by the Queensland government. In the difficulties experienced by the Queensland government they've done everything they can to step in the way of really good projects and then used the fact that they haven't got up as an excuse to throw some political barbs. It's very, very disappointing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time the NAIF has been operating, the Morrison government have listened to stakeholders in the north and we're making the necessary changes to ensure that the NAIF is more agile and adaptive to help drive the economic recovery. As of 12 February 2021, the NAIF had made $2.8 billion in investment commitments. These commitments are forecast to support 8,000 jobs and to generate around $6.6 billion in economic impact for northern Australia. Fifteen projects, worth a total of $1 billion, have loan contracts in place, meaning that projects are underway and jobs are being created in the north. There are around $2.9 billion worth of projects under due diligence and a further $3.3 billion in total projects that are active inquiries. This demonstrates the level of demand for NAIF finance under the current policy settings. Reforms are opening up equity investment and expanding the scope of projects, allowing the NAIF to enter on-lending partnerships. This has expanded the pace of investment commitments and outflow of funds, and will continue to increase.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The benefits for the NAIF are already evident in my own electorate of Leichhardt. NAIF investment will fund a new floating terminal for bauxite miners, Metro Mining, on the Skardon River in north-western Cape York. A $47.5 million NAIF loan will allow the new infrastructure for the company to load larger vessels as part of its planned Bauxite Hills Mine stage 2 expansion project. Prior to COVID there was a total workforce in the mine of around 200 people. Around 30 per cent of that workforce were local Indigenous people, but, like many other businesses and companies across Australia, Metro Mining was hit hard by the global pandemic. However, I understand mining operations will recommence in April this year, which is next month, with an initial workforce of 100 people, 27 per cent of whom are going to be Indigenous. This investment will also have significant boosts for businesses in Cape York and the Far North, and more than 95 per cent of Metro's mining supplies are coming from Far North Queensland. I recently wrote to all the mayors in Cairns, Cape York and the Torres Strait, as well as the region's advocacy bodies, to inform them of the proposed reforms and urge them to take advantage of the changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to touch on one major reform contained in the bill that I believe will supercharge the north, particularly as we emerge from the COVID pandemic. The ability of the NAIF to lend directly to project proponents in certain circumstances will simplify the lending process and reduce the administrative burden. While the states and the Territory governments remain important stakeholders for the NAIF, the ability to lend directly and bypass the states empowers the NAIF to bring projects to contractual close faster, so proponents can get on with creating jobs and developing the north. This is one of the critical points, and I have to say that this is particularly focused at the lack of cooperation from Queensland. This change also permits the NAIF to establish on-lending partnerships and local financiers to improve access to NAIF finances on small projectsâwhich is particularly important to further drive Indigenous led projects, which tend to be smaller in scaleâand to improve access to NAIF finance for smaller First Nations businesses. A lot of these businesses are much smaller than is provided for in the current guidelines, so it gives them an opportunity to capture the First Nations businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another reform contained in the bill that I believe will certainly be extremely beneficial is the expansion of eligibility for projects. This reform will make NAIF finance available for additional elements of infrastructure construction, such as equipment leasing, training and expansion of existing businesses. I know that, in the past, this has been a really major inhibitor for some businesses in being able to access a loan, and they will certainly welcome this. This reform will ensure that the NAIF can take a holistic approach to supporting economic growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NAIF will play a critical role in supporting the recovery of northern Australia from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sadly, more often than not, those on the opposite side have been more interested in playing politics, and I'm referring here specifically to the Queensland state government attacking the good work that the NAIF is doing. Never at any stage do they offer solutions, which is really no surprise. I urge those opposite, particularly the shadow minister for northern Australia, to actually work with the government to help deliver real outcomes for the north, instead of only being interested in scoring a few points, and a few likes and retweets on Twitter.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:13</span>):  Right at the outset, I want to back up the member for Leichhardt's acknowledgement of the sterling work of the Northern Territory government in getting maximum benefit out of the NAIF that has been possible. These have been difficult times to get assistance from that facility, but we all hope that much better days are ahead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a pleasure to speak on this amendment bill, the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility Amendment (Extension and Other Measures) Bill 2021, and it does seem that the government, in relation to the NAIF, has finally started to listen. The bill incorporates changes that we've been calling on the government to make for some years, so of course I support these changes, and I look forward to good results for the north out of the NAIF in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also important, I think it's a good time just to cast our minds back. It is quite impossible for any informed observer of this process of the NAIF to escape the conclusion that the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility has so far been a failure. Let's not forget that the NAIF has a budget of $5 billion. As of 30 October last year how much of that $5 billion had actually been released into the community for the private sector and other stakeholders to work with? Only $218 million since the NAIF launched back in 2016. That's less than five per cent of the funds spent in five yearsâfive per cent in five years of that big number: $5 billion. It sounded impressive when it was announced five years ago, but only $218 million at this stage has gone out onto the ground. When you think about the vast untapped potential of the north and the many projects that just need a bit of a hand to flourish and succeed, $218 million is indeed a tiny spend and an appalling figure. When you think about the great fanfare of the announcement, it's a pretty unimpressive figure. And it is why the NAIF earned the nickname 'no actual infrastructure fund'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These challenges and problems are not new. I've spoken about them many times. My judgement of the NAIF over the years has been harsh but rightly so, because the north of Australia is so important, and the NAIF has spent so little of the $5 billion over those five years. There is untapped potential, and I think it is important to say that we demand that this facility actually work to help people in northern Australia. Indeed, over the years it was difficult not to come to the conclusion that it was simply a marketing exercise and that the government wanted to look like they cared about the north. But the way it was designed meant that it was very difficult to get the funds out there onto the ground, so I welcome these changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of changes. Firstly, the purpose of financial assistance has been broadened. Rather than focusing exclusively on the construction of infrastructure, which excludes many different projects, the NAIF will be able to fund projects which promote the development of economic infrastructure in northern Australia. This may include buying equipment, leasing, training staff and expanding existing business operations. A further broadening is in relation to NAIF eligible projects. The act in its current form requires that a project create economic growth and stimulate population growth in northern Australia, both very worthwhile aims. However, the bill before us will change that requirement to an either/or proposition, rather than requiring both objectives to be met by each project. That's going to help get more funds out onto the ground.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the NAIF will now be able to provide funds directly to the proponents of eligible projects. Under the act as it currently stands, funding can only flow to projects through state or territory governments. I don't for a minute believe that the underperformance of the NAIF so far has been a consequence of the interference of state and territory governments. In fact, environmental groups have expressed concerns that the removal of state and territory governments will make it more likely that projects with more serious environmental impacts are funded. However, I will note that the governments in question, that of Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia, have all indicated that they're comfortable with this change. There are many projects in the works for the Northern Territory. I'll list them quickly. They are in different stages of the process. We hope that they can all be funded. Those that have received funding so far are the Humpty Doo Barramundi farm expansion, the airport expansion and an Indigenous tourism project.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing I want to draw the House's attention to is that, with the departure of NAIF board member Barry Calder, who is from the Territory, a new spot will open up on the NAIF board. That spot must be filled by a Territorian. The replacement of Barry Calder by anyone other than a Territorian will completely devalue and debase the NAIF. The NAIF already requires rejuvenation and improvement, to say the least. Without NT representation, improving the NAIF will be impossible. Representation is important. One thing this bill fails to do is consider how the NAIF could be meaningfully improved by expanding the representativeness of its board. The NAIF board requires not only Northern Territory representation but First Nations representation. They need a First Nations voice helping to shape that agenda. I also believe that the Indian Ocean territories must be included in our definition for northern Australia. After all, the member for Lingiari represents people in the Indian Ocean territories. The bill is far from perfect but it is an opportunity to improve the NAIF and make it actually deliver for northern Australia. I commend the government for listening to us and proposing to incorporate our changes, and I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="281826" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THOMPSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:21</span>):  I'm very glad to support the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility Amendment (Extension and Other Measures) Bill 2021 because it will mean great things for North Queensland and particularly the people of Townsville, who I have the privilege of representing in this place. The Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility has already had a major impact in Herbert, and these changes will only make it easier for it to have an even greater impact. So far, it's made funding commitments of $2.8 billion to projects that are forecast to generate at least $6.6 billion in economic impact. This is why we're asking the sector what they want and providing the means by which they can do it, in the form of these government backed loans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We in Townsville are lucky to be reaping the benefits of a large number of NAIF projects that have been backed by the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. Not only is this a show of confidence in our region; it's an opportunity for us to capitalise on the employment and economic flow-on effects. In Townsville, we have the new car park at the Mater Hospital, which is worth $20 million. There's also $50 million that has been approved for the Townsville Airport redevelopment, although those plans are currently on hold as we see what happens in the aviation sector post COVID.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also supported two projects at James Cook Universityâ$96 million for the technology innovation complex and $46 million for student accommodationâboth of which are now under construction. In 2018âit's disappointing that the member for Blair has leftâI was with the then minister and we announced this $46 million for student accommodation. Fast-forward a year and a half and I'm the member and I go back and do the same announcement. It has taken so long for this project to get up. The failure and the let-down was with the Treasurer of the Queensland Labor state government. The Treasurer at the time just put it at the bottom of the pile and didn't want to sign off on the project. The amendments to the bill will allow us to streamline this process and remove the blockage that is the Queensland Labor state government, which I'm looking forward to because we'll be able to get more projects underway in Townsville.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These great projects for our community are backed by public investment. There's one project that I want to talk about in more detail, and that's the $35 million investment in the Cowboys' brand-new HQ and Community, Training and High Performance Centre. It supports 271 jobs. The staff started to move in last month and it's an absolutely incredible project. The Cowboys' new home is positioned right next to the brand-new Queensland Country Bank Stadium and is able to take full advantage of its position. Of that $35 million federal government investment, $25 million was a loan from the NAIF. This has pretty much covered the entire cost and it has allowed this amazing project to go ahead. It has an indoor kicking area. I had a tour a couple of weeks ago and it was an honour to walk through it. It is a great place. I saw the local players get ready and train. I'm expecting big things from the Cowboys because of this facility. It has recovery pools inside. It has chilled and heated pools for their rest and recovery. It has a lecture theatre and study areas and a public coffee shop where anybody can come for a coffee and have a chance to spot a player and get a photo. There are a few new jobs there in the cafe, which adds to the construction jobs; there were 213 during the construction and 58 have been supported through the operational phase and as a result of the expansion. That's a project that has already been delivered, and there are other ones that are getting started or are halfway through. So we're seeing that the NAIF is working. It's providing finance for massive projects to get over the line and creating much needed infrastructure as well as jobs at the same time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So why are we here today? Why are we wanting to make changes to the way the NAIF works? The main thing is that we want to get those small businesses and organisations, as well as the big ones, over the line. There are so many great projects out there that haven't qualified because they're not large enough on the scale that the NAIF currently demands, but they would still create dozens if not hundreds of jobs either in the construction phase or ongoing, which is good for our economy. So we are allowing the NAIF to be a proactive financier. That means not just offering a loan that has to be paid back but actually making equity investments. This will open up more opportunities for small and medium-sized businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This decision was made in response to the feedback that we needed to see faster approval times, to see more focus on smaller projects and to remove the restriction that NAIF funding was for physical infrastructure only. That means that, with this bill, the NAIF will be opened up to finance not only capital infrastructure but also other elements of successful projects, such as equipment purchase or leasing, training and the expansion of business operations. There will be a cap on the $5 billion amount that can be used for equity investments; that will be $500 million. We'll see the NAIF in partnerships with local financiers. NAIF finance could be as simple as heading down to the local bank.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm really excited to see what businesses and entrepreneurs in our region will achieve with these new financing options. I think this will be a game changer, helping those small operators take on bigger projects which stand to benefit us all and, I know, will benefit the region, especially in Townsville. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:27</span>):  It's my pleasure to speak, albeit briefly, in this debate on the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility Amendment (Extension and Other Measures) Bill 2021. We on this side of the chamber will be supporting the legislation, although I want to raise two issues of concern to me. I won't go through the details of the bill; others have done that adequately. I note that there is recognition of members of the NAIF board having economic experience in Indigenous communities. It is my strong view that it should be mandated that there be a First Nations representative on the NAIF board. I hope that the government sees the merit of this and amends the legislation to ensure that that happens. Secondly, I note that they're seeking changes for the local government area of Ngaanyatjarraku, in Western Australia, to be considered part of northern Australia for the purpose of the NAIF.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've submitted, and there have been discussions with the minister's office through the shadow minister, as I understand it, to have the Indian Ocean territories considered part of northern Australia. You might ask, 'Aren't they?' They are, but they're not considered part of northern Australia for the purposes of this bill. That, in my view, is a joke. Christmas Island is located at latitude 10.490291 degrees south and longitude 105.63275 degrees east. Check your maps! The Cocos Islands are located at 12.200603 degrees south and 96.85894 degrees east. These are both close to the latitude of Darwin, so how they could not be considered part of northern Australia is totally beyond me. By air, Christmas Island is a 3Â½-hour flight from Perth and the Cocos Islands are a 4Â½-hour flight from Perth. Christmas Island is 2,600 from Perth and the Cocos Islands are 3,000 kilometres from Perth. Christmas Island is roughly the same distance from Darwin. So why aren't these considered part of northern Australia?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that there is a national demand for investment on these two communities for a whole range of reasons. We know that infrastructure is an issue for both these communities. For those who don't know, the major industry on Christmas Island is phosphate mining, an industry that, in the wake of COVID-19, has experienced increased demand out of China, Europe and Africa. Christmas Island has limited handling facilities because it lacks a harbour and access to port facilities. It has a prolonged monsoonal swell season, which is current on Christmas Island, to the point where the ship bringing supplies in, which was due in November, didn't arrive until three weeks ago. Obviously better freight services development on Christmas Island is the type of project that could be available through NAIF. There are many other projects which are being proposed and thought about, such as the mountain bike project and opportunities for an ecoresort on Christmas Island. There are so many other things that people would like to do, if they were able to access the sorts of resources that are available to other parts of Australia. It is a unique place because insurance is a major problem, so getting lending from financial institutions is really difficult.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Cocos Islands have similar infrastructure issues as Christmas Island. It's also subject to monsoonal weather events. This year the community had a major cyclone event which required emergency procedures on the major populated island, Home Island, to be activated when there was a danger of major flooding. The extreme wet season has also seen delays in freight reaching the island, as ships are unable to load barges to be towed to the island, resulting in food shortages and a lack of access to vital medical supplies. Alarmingly, in recent years, major sandbagging along the beaches of Cocos has become increasingly common as the community deals with climate change due to rising sea levels. Cocos, if you like, is the canaryâin this case, the birdcageâof the islands, sounding the warning for the need for action on climate change. Again, this sort of development and infrastructure requirement that could be addressed through the NAIF process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are obviously proposals for other economic development opportunities, tourism infrastructure and other things. Already the local council, with the support of the community, is working with the potential developers to cater for a boutique ecotourism resort. Islanders in the Indian Ocean territories want to enjoy the same access to services, food and medical security as mainlanders. They want to enjoy the same access to concessional loans and other measures, which are being amended as part of this bill, through the NAIF process yet they're being denied it by this government, who refuse to accept that Christmas and the Cocos Islands, the Indian Ocean Territories, are part of northern Australia This is an opportunity for them to be considered part of northern Australia through this NAIF process. That is a shame and it should be changed. I invite the government to amend the legislation when it hits the Senate to include the Christmas and Cocos Islands, the Indian Ocean Territories, as part of the NAIF consideration.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:33</span>):  I rise today to speak on the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility Amendment (Extension and Other Measures) Bill 2021. For those who don't know, in shorthand, the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility is called the NAIF. It was established under statute in 2016. It is a government agency with $5 billion to invest to provide the basis for economic and population growth in northern Australia. The NAIF was established with the intent to fill financing gaps in northern Australia by being more risk tolerant to uniquely northern Australian characteristics like remoteness, distance and climate. As of September last year, the NAIF has made approximately $2.7 billion worth of loans and has $2.3 billion left in funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this bill does is not entirely what is being portrayed in this place. This bill will extend the life of the NAIF for a further five years, which is fine, but it will make substantial changes to the NAIF's operations. The explanatory memorandum states that these changes will strengthen the NAIF's governance and enhance the scope, speed and flexibility to provide financial assistance to support the development of northern Australian economic infrastructure. While the NAIF is an essential vehicle to support northern Australia, I do not agree that the changes will result in these outcomes. On the contrary, the changes will weaken independence and result in the potential funding of stranded assets with public money. The government claims that the reforms contained in this bill arise from the recent statutory review of the NAIF released in December last year. This review was not independent. It was conducted by the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources. This is basically the fox conducting a review of the safety of the hen house. These reviews must be conducted at arm's length from the government. The result is that this push is flawed from the very outset.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How can the public be assured that taxpayer money is being spent appropriately? This is really the funding of fossil fuel projects. Minister Pitt has made clear in his public comments that he would like to 'cut out state administration of the loans', which he said was 'partly to blame for delayed rollout of funding on projects'. But it is not as simple as cutting them out due to delays; they want to cut them out to push fossil fuel projects. In the past, state and territory veto has provided an important check on government expenditure. For example, when the NAIF proposed to make a $1 billion taxpayer funded loan to Adani Carmichael mine's rail line, the state government threatened to veto any loan and said they would veto any other proposals linked to Adani. So it is very clear here what the government want to do with these changes. The minister has said that this bill will enable the Commonwealth to bypass the state on certain projects, including interstate rail and gas projects.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's Beetaloo Strategic Basin Plan, released in January also states:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The government has also announced changes to the NAIF â¦ They can also support Beetaloo infrastructure developments.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very clear what is intended to be done here. The plan goes further and says the government would like to be:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">facilitating Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (NAIF) discussions to ensure that stakeholders do not miss out on Beetaloo gas development opportunities.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Beetaloo Basin is a methane bomb. It is irresponsible in the extreme for the government to attempt to open it up. This is the same basin that the government's own department said would risk Australia failing to meet its Paris commitments. One conservative report projected that the basin will release some 117 million tonnes of greenhouse gases per annum, equivalent to one-fifth of Australia's annual emissions. We must reject any move to allow further funding to fossil fuel projects, especially in the Beetaloo Basin.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NAIF should focus, instead, on clean technology and on the types of projects that are being raised by members in this place. Northern Australia can be a renewable energy superpower. Think of the Sun Cable and the Asian Renewable Energy Hub. Projects of this magnitude are possible with the right support. I know many renewable project developers in Warringah, particularly at the Manly Solar Beach Hub, who would support such a move and would no doubt be interested in developing clean energy projects in northern Australia with such support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clause 11 in the amendment bill expands the functions of the NAIF to allow for the provision of financial assistance in the form of equity investments, meaning that the government could take a stake in the business and it's not a loan which is repayable. This increases the risk appetite of the NAIF as well as the Commonwealth's potential liability should the investment not work out. This is of particular concern when analysed in the context of the NAIF making investments in fossil fuel infrastructure that the market does not want to support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clause 11 also allows for the acquisition of derivatives. The government states derivatives must only be used for, amongst other factors, achieving indirect exposure to financial assets and achieving transactional efficiency. That sounds a lot like financial jargon, but this language really gives the NAIF a licence to do anything. It, in essence, gives NAIF management free rein to play around in derivatives. Even worse, there is no requirement to make a financial return. We are talking here about free rein to go for loss-making projects. It could mean the government buying gas contracts to guarantee the supply price and volume at a later date. It could mean supporting pipelines and it could mean funding Shine Energy's Collinsville coal-fired power plantâand I note the energy minister sitting there at the dispatch box.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, problems arise if the gas or power plant are not needed due to factors, of course, like increasing penetration of renewable generation. The government would be left holding the problem and would still have to pay. And they may well do just that, as fossil-fuel-production extraction and its supporting infrastructure have huge carbon risk and are likely to be stranded assets in the very near future. The gas industry has had a shocking 2020, shedding huge amounts in shareholder value and writing down assets across the board. In particular, Santos, which is aiming to develop the Beetaloo, has written down over $8 billion worth in assets since 2014. So it's no surprise that industry have their hands out for government assistance. Of course they know that none of the projects they're proposing will get up without the government kick along.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not believe the taxpayer should foot the bill for bad fossil fuel investments. The NAIF should not be a slush fund for the minister's projects. There's a serious lack of independence proposed; the changes are likely to impact the independence of the NAIF board from the government. Currently, the NAIF board makes all investment decisions. Section 14 of the NAIF Act reads:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(1) The functions of the Board are:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(a)  to decide, within the scope of the Investment Mandate, the strategies and policies to be followed by the Facilityâ¦</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clause 25 of this amendment bill provides that the secretary of the department will now be a member of the board. As the secretary reports to the minister for energy and the government, this change could open up the board to ministerial influence and could erode confidence in NAIF's investments. This is just a cynical attempt to consolidate influence on the already-weak governance of the NAIF.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill makes serious changes to the NAIF's governance that will facilitate payments to fossil fuel projects: let's be very clear about what this does. The bill will also make changes that will reduce the independence of the NAIF board. I do not support these changes. We cannot waste taxpayer money on fossil fuels and we cannot allow an agency to be so co-opted. At a time when our national debt is at record levels we must not allow the government to waste public funds on bad fossil fuel projects. We need the NAIF to be independent and focused on the future of infrastructure and development in northern Australia, and we need a future focus on technologies which are clean energy technologies.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:42</span>):  In the middle of a climate crisis, the government brings the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility Amendment (Extension and Other Measures) Bill 2021 to this parliament to take public money which could be going to schools and hospitals and instead use it for coal and gas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're in a climate emergency. Around the world and here in Australia, people are in rebellion against the billionaires and the big corporations who are pulling the strings of governments and politicians. This week in my electorate of Melbourne citizens have come together for a week of action and civil disobedience, disrupting business as usual in defence of a safe climate. I want to say very clearly for the historical record that these people are heroes. They're refusing to be bystanders. They're refusing to accept the failure of our governments and our leaders, and they're not going to stop until they see real action to fix the climate crisis. So I extend my solidarity to Extinction Rebellion and, on behalf of the Australian Greens, the solidarity of us all. Together, everyone across Australiaâfrom the people taking direct action now to the student strikers and the people at home worried about the futureâwill continue the struggle and, together, we will win.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no greater threat to northern Australia than the climate crisis. This should be a major factor in our consideration of this bill. That's because this bill seeks to extend the time frame and the remit of the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facilityâthe NAIF. It will allow it to operate for another five years, insert a departmental officer into the NAIF board, remove the requirement to gain the support of the host state or territory for future projects supported by the NAIF, and expand the funding mechanisms to include equity investments and acquisitions of derivatives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments are promoted by the government as providing flexibility to deliver for the NT and northern Australia, but their aim is clear: the government wants to deliver for its mates. Minister Pitt has not even tried to hide his desire to use the facility as a slush fund for the gas industry. He has boasted about the amendments opening up more opportunities for Beetaloo infrastructure financing. It's a dirty energy fund that is yet another fossil fuel subsidy, on top of the fossil fuel subsidies that this government hands out to coal, gas and the dirty energy sector. Minister Pitt has boasted that the amendments will allow the Commonwealth to bypass the states on certain projects. I remind the parliament that the ability of state governments to veto investment decisions in fossil fuels was key to this slush fund not being used to prop up the economically irresponsible climate bond that is the Adani Carmichael mine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens will be proposing amendments to the bill in the Senate to restrain the excesses enabled by the NAIF and ensure that all investments have an eye to a sustainable future for northern Australia. The Greens have long argued that the NAIF must consider the Australian government's commitment to the temperature goals in the Paris Agreement, where we have agreed to commit to limit global warming to well below two degrees and to continue to work towards limiting it to 1Â½ degrees. But our current domestic pledges from this governmentâthese targets that the minister boasts about meeting and beatingâcome nowhere close to what science shows is needed to meet the temperature goals under the Paris Agreement. But, without question, to have any chance of avoiding us going over the climate cliff and avoiding the climate crisis becoming a runaway chain reaction that we can't control, we cannot finance new fossil fuel infrastructure. That should be a baseline.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The discussion we should be having in this place is about how to phase out coal and gas, not how to take money that should be going to schools and hospitals and use it to build more coal and gas infrastructure. But that's what this government is trying to do. The Morrison government wants to use the NAIF to fund gas pipelines which will help gas companies who want to open up new gas fields. They want to use public funds to throw more fuel on the climate crisis. NAIF should be required to assess the environmental and climate impact of any project as part of assessing whether it is suitable for investment. It must also consider the environmental record of the people in charge of those projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things this bill wants to do is open up the NAIF for equity investments in fossil fuels. In other words, because the market and the private sector are saying, 'No-one in their right mind is going to build new coal and gas projects,' the government comes along and says, 'Let's use public money to help you out, and we might even take an ownership stake in your company to give you a help-out because we know that the private sector can't do it on its own.' This is because parts of the private sector are starting to understand the gravity of the climate crisis. They understand that the fuel from renewables is free, but dirty coal and gas not only are polluting but are more expensive, which is why many of these projects aren't going to get off the ground unless the government takes public money that could be going to schools and hospitals and gives it to big gas corporationsâthe big gas corporations that pay zero tax, that have over $50 billion in revenue between them but pay zero dollars tax. Instead of saying, 'Maybe the gas corporations should pay more tax,' the government says, 'How can we give you even more handouts and give you some public money, instead of asking you to pay your fair share of tax?' It wants to potentially have the public on the hook for owning some of this infrastructure that is going to make the climate crisis worse. This will mean the public ends up exposed to risk for these stranded assets and exposed to risk as, hopefully, a future government, once we've kicked this terrible government out, starts to take action on the climate crisis. This government is putting the public on the hook for future risk if we get serious about tackling the climate crisis. An acquisition of derivatives can leave the government with an open-ended, unquantifiable liability, if a project proponent becomes insolvent, so they're putting you on the hook not just for equities sake but for derivatives down the line as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that there are some worthwhile projects, including those championed by First Nations organisations, that could benefit from some broader investment opportunities. But these types of speculative investments could be used, as the government wants to propose, to underwrite gas supply and prop up otherwise stranded assets. Given the NAIF's poor governance practices and processes for assessing risk on public lending, especially risks related to fossil fuels and climate change, this is an unacceptable risk. Tighter rules around eligibility for equity investment options introduced by the bill are essential to ensure the government isn't left carrying the can for unsustainable fossil fuel projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For a bill with 'Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility' in the title, it's pretty astounding that the bill proposes to remove the mandatory requirement for infrastructure to stimulate population growth in northern Australia, which was the key motivation for the NAIF in the first place. Removing this requirement will make it easier for the minister to push NAIF into funding gas infrastructure and pipelines, including pipelines that are not located in northern Australia. The independence of the board is also compromised under this. The government has never set up the NAIF in the way, in the power-sharing parliament of 2010, we set up the Clean Energy Finance Corporationâthat is, as an independent body with statutory authority and rigour. But the government is so unhappy with the decisions that have been made so far that it wants to exert even more control by requiring the secretary of the department to be a member of the NAIF board, undermining any semblance of independence. It makes the NAIF directly susceptible to ministerial influence. This is a slush fund for the minister to reward the big gas corporations who pay no tax, who fast-track the climate crisis and who, in many instances, donate to the Liberal Party and the Labor Party.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister has already been spruiking fossil fuel projects and using the NAIF to further the government's discredited gas-fired recovery. When the NAIF was created, the government said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The expert, transparent and arms-length design of the Board lends credibility to financial markets, while ensuring the Commonwealth invests in projects which are viable, provide public benefit and unlock the potential of northern Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was their spin at the time, but now they're not even pretending that that's the case. When it turned out that the investments don't favour loss-making fossil fuel endeavours, the government has tried to regain control of the decisions by rewriting the rules and exerting more control over how those decisions are made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Senate inquiry into the operation of the NAIF a few years ago we heard evidence from First Nations and regional communities in northern Australia that the board needed to take a more innovative approach to investment, looking beyond traditional and often outdated and unsustainable projects, like mines and dams, but this goes the other way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned earlier, the Greens strongly oppose allowing the NAIF to directly loan to entities, bypassing state and territory governments. The NAIF's clear function is to grant financial assistance to states and territories for the construction of northern Australian economic infrastructure. But previous reviews of the NAIF identified the need for the NAIF to work more closely with state and territory governments, not to cut them out. Providing the option of bypassing the states and territories increases the federal government's power to drive new fossil fuel infrastructure at the public expense and takes away a key check and balance. Cutting out the states also raises serious and unresolved questions as to constitutional validity. This bill should, at a minimum, be sent to a committee so that this important issue can be properly considered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, at a time when we are faced with a climate crisis, when we know we have a few short years to turn the ship around before we go over the climate cliff after which we can't wind back the effects of climate change, most people would be looking to this parliament for a plan to get out of coal and gas. They have probably come to accept, sadly, that the government's not interested in a plan to get out of coal and gas. But most people would be shocked to know that their own moneyâmoney that could be going to schools and hospitalsâis being rerouted to big gas corporations who pay no tax, to make the climate crisis worse, simply because those corporations also happen to be donors to the Liberal and Labor parties. That is what is going on here. This is a form of money laundering that will make the climate crisis worse, by saying to the big corporations, 'We're not only going to refuse to ask you to pay your fair share of tax but we're going to use public money for you to go and build these gas pipelines that are going to fast-track the climate crisis and risk making large parts of our country uninhabitable for our children during our children's lifetime.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard, over repeated times in estimates, from our own Bureau of Meteorology that as we are forecast, on current projections, to hit 3.4 degrees of global warming by the end of this century in Australia that probably means a degree higher. That means, under this government, and these smug ministers who sit there delivering for their gas corporation mates, during the lifetime of my daughter, of primary school children across this country, on current trends Australia is set to warm 4Â½ degrees. That is a hell scape. That means large parts of Australia, including northern Australia, will become uninhabitable during my daughter's lifetime, during the lifetime of Australia's primary school students. We should be doing everything in our power to stop that. We definitely should not be using public money to make the situation worse, and that's why we oppose this bill. When it gets through here we will be moving substantial amendments in the Senate.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KATTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:57</span>):  There has been a profound change in the NAIF. We hope the minister, who I hope has been responsible for those changes, will continue on that positive course. To date in North Queensland we have got $50 million for the airport in Townsville, which I use maybe four times a week. I have seen absolutely no change in anything at the Townsville Airport. There was a nice little golden handshake for a foreign corporation that owns the airport with no benefit to the users of the airport.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the James Cook University technical innovation buildingâ$100 million. Here we go. That's $150 million and no tangible benefit that we can perceive whatsoever. Bear with me for a moment, I am just going through them. There was $610 million for a foreign corporation where the Australian applicants were passed over. It was given to them and then they got a $610 million golden handshake. Charles Darwin University got $151 million really for a building. Universities are not operating as such because no-one can go to them on account of COVID. They are having a good holiday actually. The Darwin Port got $300 million. The Darwin Port was sold by Andrew Robb to the Chinese. Then he moved onto a million dollars a year the next year off the company that he sold the seaport to. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at this: $300 million for a Chinese port; $151 million for a university that's not working; $610 million for a foreign corporation, which passed over an Australian corporation that should have got the contract in North Queensland; $46 million for extensions to JCU in Townsville; $20 million for a football team; $150 million for Northern Territory Airports, which I understand is foreign owned; $50 million for Townsville Airport, from which I have seen no benefit whatsoever; and $100 million for the James Cook University Technology Innovation Complex. Not bad! That's $1.5 billion that has gone to create virtually no jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope Minister Pitt is listening in. You're doing a good job, my friend. But, prior to him getting the portfolio, the blokes there handed out $1.5 billion to produce not a single job. And the vast bulk of it has gone to foreign corporations. Their handling of this has been absolutely disastrous. Peta Credlin said on television that, in the fifth year, we gave $1.5 billion to this fund and not a single cent has been spent. So then they went out on a wild spending spree and blew $1.5 billion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's in the past. I cannot not fault them since the new minister has taken over. I think that, at long last, they're starting to perform the way they should have performed. But, unfortunately, they have burnt up a couple of thousand million dollars there to achieve hardly a single damn job and hardly a single development of value to the Australian people. Closed universities and foreign ports are hardly advantages for the Australian people. The only one I'm intimately familiar with is the Townsville Airport, which I use; as I said, I can see no difference from where it was prior to the spending of the $50 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NAIF has been very good on the issue of CopperString, and so have successive governments. I want to put on the public record my praise for the Rudd government, for the Gillard government and for the 'Abbott-Credlin government'. Each of them gave, in today's money, over $400 million as a grant to this scheme. We compete on the world market with our silver, lead and zinc. We have the biggest zinc mine in the world. We built the biggest copper mine in the world. We have one of the six or seven biggest fertiliser plants in the worldâall in the North West Minerals Province. We can't compete because we get our electricity at a price that makes us hopelessly uncompetitive. It's wonderful for this place to say, 'Oh, we will have a competitive market,' but it ain't any competitive market for the Pilbara that's earning you all of your money, it ain't any competitive market for the North West Minerals Province that's earning you all of your money and it ain't any competitive market for Olympic Dam. Coal, yes. But the other three? Nothing. So the Rudd government immediately announced that they were connecting those three areas to the national grid so we would get competitively priced power.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, our problem in the North West Minerals Provinceâand I ask the minister to please listen to thisâis that we have one tiny little power station, hopelessly non-competitive, that has no economies of scale; it's too small. Also, it is on gas, and the governments of Australiaâstate mostly, in this case, and federalâgave our gas away for 6c a unit. We currently buy it for $16.60 a unit. Our competitors are buying it for $6, and we've got to buy it for $16.60 and, unfortunately for us, we need the gas as well as the gas electricity, so we get doubly hit. So we get hit (a) because of the tiny little power station, (b) because it's on gas and (c) because there's a monopoly, and it would very stupid if they didn't take advantage of their monopoly situation in the marketplace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is not the slightest doubt in my mind that Glencore and the fertiliser plant will benefit to the tune of $50 million a year if that powerline goes in. There is also no doubt in my mind that if it doesn't go in there'll be a complete collapse in the economy of the North West Minerals Province. It's not pie in the sky, or garbage. Glencore announced 2Â½ years ago the closure of the copper refinery in Townsville and the copper smelter in Mount Isa, and of course the fertiliser plant has no sulphur coming from the copper operations, so it closed as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was announced. Massive concessions have been provided by the state government. I don't want to be cynical, but they were provided just before the state electionsâwhich happened to be when the closures were going to occur. So, we were very, very lucky; we got let off the hook! But we're only off the hook for a little while, unless we can get that. And, Minister, if your government is wanting to do something, Eva is a mine that will produce 160,000 tonnes of copper ore a year, which makes everything out there viable and will put about $1 billion a year into the Australian economy. In my opinion, it will not go ahead unless it has competitively priced power. Either you want it or you don't want it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can sit here and give you 20 other Eva examples. But we need Eva to keep the copper refinery in Townsville going, to keep the copper smelter in Mount Isa going, to keep the copper mines in Cloncurry and Mount Isa going and to keep the fertiliser plant, which brings in $2,000 million a year by itself, going. That is what is needed to keep them going. We've had a very positive response. I thank the minister because there's been a very positive response from NAIF on this. But there will have to be more money. Also, after all this wastage, Minister, you haven't got a lot of money left in the piggy bank, and that money has to be replenished. It is the one fund that can deliver.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have great faith in the new minister. I have had great faith in the new board, and the directions it's taking. I've read out to you the disasters that have occurredâin five years, not a dollar went out on anything, and then, among the projects that did get money, there wasn't a single job; half of them were for foreign corporations and the other half were for universities that were closed. The only one I'm really familiar with is Townsville Airport. Well, I can absolutely assure you that you could take the 10,000 people who use that airport regularly and they would tell you there has been no change in anything at that airport. Who knows what they did with the $50 million? And really, who cares at this stage?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I conclude my remarks by saying that we have had a whole new world, with a new regime under a new minister and a new board. Already they're doing exciting things, but a lot more money will have to be put into the till if this is to play a meaningful part in the development of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I sit down, for the economy of Australia there is $3,000 million a year out there waiting in the Hells Gate proposal. It is superclean energy. It actually lowers the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. Previous speakers have gone on and on about the world coming to an end over CO2, and to some degree I agree with them in a minor way. This project will deliver seven per cent of Australia's petrol, 1Â½ per cent of Australia's electricity and 10 per cent of Australia's ox production, pig production or chook production through the feedlots and it will lower the existing CO2 in the atmosphere. CO2 is not an emission and is not a by-product; it is a product. We want to produce as much CO2 as is humanly possible because it feeds algae. The CO2 comes from the algae and the CO2 goes into the algae, so we're putting CO2 into algae.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's $3 billion for the Australian economy in that one project. If the transmission line goes through, you can add another $2 million to the Australian economy. If you build a rail line and a multi-user facility in the Galilee, there will be $20 billion coming in. If you give money to silicon development, there will be another $5 billion coming in from the super-rich silica deposits in Cape Yorkânot at Cape Flattery or at Hope Vale but much further north. If you build a canal to enable us to get our fertiliser product out, we will give you the biggest fertiliser plant in the world, bringing in $6 billion a year and $2 billion in prawn production.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister, this is what we can give you, but we need that NAIF, so please take your gun down, put it at the head of the Treasurer and get that money.</span>

I table a correction to the explanatory memorandum. The NAIF was established to provide concessional finance to infrastructure projects for the benefit of northern Australia. It encourages and complements private sector investment in the region, helping build confidence in northern Australia as an attractive place to live, work, invest and do business. The NAIF has already made investment decisions worth $2.8 billion, supporting job creation and economic development throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. This track record of investment puts the NAIF in a great position to continue supporting northern Australia's economic development.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility Amendment (Extension and Other Measures) Bill 2021 extends the active investment period of the NAIF. It also delivers reforms that will enhance its effectiveness and impact and that will assist with the economic recovery. The bill contains measures to accelerate investment decision-making and lending. These measures will make it easier and faster for eligible projects to access NAIF funds and get on with creating jobs and developing the north. In future, the NAIF will be able to lend directly to proponents in certain circumstances. The states and territories have been and will continue to be critical partners for the NAIF; however, the option of direct lending will enable the NAIF to reduce the administrative burden on those jurisdictions. The NAIF will be able to invest in on-lending partnerships. These will deliver NAIF finance to smaller projects with the assistance of a partner experienced in working with smaller proponents to access financial support. Finally, the bill extends the scope and flexibility of NAIF investment to ensure projects get the kind of tailored, innovative financial assistance they need to succeed. The correction to the bill's explanatory memorandum clarifies that the NAIF can provide this financial assistance in many forms, including equity investments to corporations.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill represents the first step in implementing the government's reforms to the NAIF. As soon as possible, a new investment mandate for the NAIF will be tabled. Together the bill and the investment mandate provide the operating framework for the NAIF, under which it can begin to deliver on these reforms.</span>

The NAIF must be independent of government. It must be independent for the community to trust that the provision of financial assistance is given with the utmost integrity and it must be independent to prevent ministerial influence on decisions of the NAIF. We've seen time and again this government seeking to stack agency boards with sympathisers or government employees. We saw it with the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and we see it again here. With this fund we are not talking small amounts of taxpayers' money; we are talking billions of dollars, huge sums that will be spent, and we can't allow it to become a government controlled slush fund.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amendment (2) will introduce a new section 8A which will ensure that taxpayer money is not used to support risky, loss-making fossil fuel ventures. It's extraordinary considering last year's fires and droughts and this year's historic floods that this government is here today seeking to support gas projects in the Northern Territory through the NAIF. The minister's comments were plain, and that is what these changes are really for. It's reckless and irresponsible in the extreme. Gas is as polluting as coal, and methane, the by-product, is far worse for the atmosphere in the short term. It is also incredibly poor economics. The revenues of the gas industry are being eroded by the continual price deflation in the cost of renewables. The result is fossil fuel majors are destroying their shareholders' wealth and writing down billions in assets. Santos, for example, since 2014 has written down over $8 billion of its assets. Many gas projects have been abandoned, and R&amp;D spending has been downsizing. Oil and gas are in a precarious position caught between a confluence of forces. It's in structural decline. The industry knows this, and the market knows this. That's why they have their hands out for subsidies from sympathetic governments. The answer should be an unequivocal no.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The recent Grattan Institute report <span style="font-style:italic;">Flame out: the future of natural gas</span> said the only rational approach for governments, the energy industry and its customers is to begin planning for a future without natural gas or at least with a substantially reduced role for natural gas. Instead of redirecting funding to fossil fuel projects, the NAIF should be promoting a clean technology vision for northern Australia. Northern Australia has enormous potential to supply the world with energy harnessed from remarkable wind and solar resources. The Sun Cable project and the Asian Renewable Energy Hub are two examples of what is possible. The amendments that I propose will ensure that NAIF funding is directed only towards worthy projects, not fossil fuel projects. The NAIF should remain independent. It should invest only in clean technologies that are actually for the future of northern Australia. Anything else would be money wasted. I commend these amendments to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:25</span>):  I and the Greens support these very sensible amendments that have been moved, but it's worth being clear how it is that we got to the point of moving these amendments. The only reason we're debating these amendments moved by the member for Warringah is that Liberal and Labor voted just then to give public money to new gas projects. That's what they just voted for. We have a government fronting up and saying that it wants to take billions of dollars that could be going to schools and hospitals and, instead, use it to fast-track the climate crisis by expanding new gas projects in northern Australia. Liberal and Labor just voted for that. You can't say, 'We're in a climate emergency,' and then turn around and give public money to new gas projects, especially when we know that gas is as dirty as coal and when we know that expanding the Beetaloo Basin projectâwhich is what this government wants to do and, apparently, is what Labor wants to do as wellâwill blow any chance we have of Australia doing its fair share in meeting the Paris goals of limiting global warming to well below two degrees, while still aiming for 1Â½ degrees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments are absolutely critical. I think most people in the country would accept that the government doesn't quite get climate change, and most people in the country would accept that the government's not doing enough to tackle the climate crisis. But most people in the country would also be stunned to know that they themselves, the public, are bankrolling big gas corporations with the permission of Liberal and Labor. That's because what has just happened is that they have both voted to say, 'Let's take public money and make it available to big gas corporations.' And do you know what? The big gas corporations just brought in $50 billion in revenue and paid zero dollars tax. So not only do these corporations pay no tax but Liberal and Labor say: 'We'll give you handouts. We'll give you money that could be going to bring down the cost of dental care or making public schools genuinely free.' No! Thanks to that vote, this money is now going to big gas corporations, who are going to be building stranded assets, and the public is going to be on the hook for them. We know we've got to get out of coal and gas. We absolutely cannot build any more new coal and gas. We have to get out of it. What we certainly should not do is use public money to make the climate crisis worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments are very sensible and they are very critical because they make it plain that this fund cannot be used as a slush fund for the big gas corporations, which is what the government is trying to do. I'm disappointed, but not surprised, that the government moved this, because the government is just delivering, and this is payback for the political donations that the big gas corporations have given to the Liberal Party. But it appears that it's payback for the donations that the big gas corporations have given to the Labor Party as well. I urge the opposition to rethink and to support these amendments, so that no public money can go to fossil fuel projects as part of this terrible NAIF slush fund that the government is establishing.</span>

Ramadan will begin on 12 April, when we're all away from this place. Families across Australia, and indeed right around the world, are now preparing for the holy month where they will abstain from food, drinking and bad thoughts from dawn to sundown. Ramadan is about exercising self-restraint, reconnecting with one's faith and being grateful for family and friends. It's often described as starving the body to feed the soul. I want to say also that this month will be different from last year. People will actually be able to gather. It's an important time for family and friends and communities to gather. At the end of Ramadan there will be gatherings of friends and family for iftar dinners across the country. I say to all of our Muslim communities around Australia: Ramadan Mubarak. Have a very happy rest of the month ahead.</span>

I believe that we have a responsibility in this place to break down the stigma associated with mental ill health. That's why, when calling for a royal commission into veteran suicide this week, I spoke about the nightmare of suicide for victims' families and also first responders. For as long as any of us can remember in Australia, fire and rescue, paramedics, police and others on the frontline of trauma, grief and life-threatening situations have coped by masking their emotions, often using dark humour or silence and often alcohol and substance abuse. Like many major conditions, there are answers and they involve recovery but also prevention.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is where Fortem Australia delivers an evidence based model to improve mental health and wellbeing outcomes for first responders. I met with Fortem's new chairman, Graham Ashton, and their CEO, John Bale. I welcome Graham Ashton's leadership to the board. During his 40 years of service in law enforcement, Ashton had a strong concern about the need to address mental ill health for those first responders under him. Fortem does a great job in assisting first responders, and the government has provided $6.5 million in assistance to them, but more is needed for them to continue with their great service.</span>

Australia is home to the largest population of Greeks outside Greece and Cyprus. Greek Australians are proud of their language and culture, which gave birth to democracy. Today, Greek communities will be celebrating all over Australia. They will be celebrating in my seat of Adelaide. I look forward to attending many of the events this weekend. The Adelaide Town Hall will be lit up tonight in blue and white. The Greek flag will fly proudly over the Adelaide Town Hall and the South Australian state parliament. Here, in Canberra, Greek flags are already flying on many of our capital's public buildings. The Sydney Opera House will be lit up in blue and white, the colours of the Greek flag. I wish the Greek-Australian community in South Australia and all of Australia all the very best as we celebrate 200 years of the bicentenary of Greek independence. The Greek spirit lives on in all of us. [Greek language not transcribed].</span>

Earlier this month I had the privilege of celebrating the 60th anniversary of the Cancer Council Queensland with staff and volunteers. They are dedicated to improving quality of life for people living with cancer, through research, patient care, prevention and early detection. The CEO, Chris McMillan, reflected on the work of the Gold Coast volunteers, and gave insight into how important the work is and how tireless volunteers are. They do fundraising campaigns, such as Daffodil Day, the Gold Coast Marathon, merchandise sales, runs, walks, skipping and bingo events and all sorts of activities to raise money to support those people living with cancer. Volunteers gave time to run daffodil shops, for approximately 25 years, and supported locals undergoing chemotherapy by supplying wigs and turbans. Volunteers helped run the first mobile breast screen mammography bus on the Gold Coast over two decades ago.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two of the great volunteers present at the event were Di Dixon and Julie Ferguson, well known on the Gold Coast. Di has been volunteering for 43 years with the Cancer Council. She started because a close friend lost their son to cancer and she lost her brother to the same cancer. And Julie's husband contracted cancer after she started her involvement, making the work even more personal for her. Well done and thank you to all those who have contributed to the work of the Cancer Council Queensland over six decades.</span>

Some of the most prominent heroes of the Greek revolution were women: the naval commander Laskarina Bouboulina, the Italian born Manto Mavrogenous, the Phanariote Princess Rallou Karatza and the Souliote Moscho Tzavela, who commanded a 400-strong all-female rebel force. They and thousands more were leaders. They were not victims. They commanded respect and admiration. They inspired, they fought and they often died alongside their men, their husbands, their sons, their fathers, their sisters, their daughters and their mothers with equal courage and dedication. Theirs is an effort regarded by many Greek feminists as the moment when gender equality was forged. Today I want to pay tribute to and acknowledge and recognise the universality of their legacy and their struggle.</span>

So it has been heartening to hear stories of neighbours looking out for each other and looking after each other. This Sunday is Neighbour Day. It's an opportunity for us to celebrate the role of our neighbourhoods and to also celebrate the role of our neighbours in making sure that everything has been okay and that everything will be okay. In recent years I have hosted an event in the sanctuary, the park there in Daisy Hill. This year I will join an event co-hosted by the Kingston East Neighbourhood Group, the Logan East Community Neighbourhood Association and Crestmead Neighbourhood Watchâtwo separate events. It is not too late for people in our community to join an event or to host their own event, or even just have a yarn over the back fence or in the driveway and share a coffee or a beer. I want to thank Relationships Australia for organising Neighbour Day nationally and everyone in our community who has put so much effort into getting together on such an important day.</span>

Nolia, better known as Nanna Ramsamy, has enriched our city with her love of family, her love of culture, her love for her community and her great sense of fun and adventure.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">She was born on Prince of Wales Island in the Torres Strait in 1917 and grew up loving fishing, hunting and picture shows. Living off the ocean and mangroves was more than food; it was a celebration of culture and something nanna relished throughout her later years. She came to settle in Mackay in 1943 after her family was evacuated to the mainland during World War II. It was there she met a handsome showman and renowned educator on poisonous snakes, Edward Ramsamy, better known as Ram Chandra, the taipan man.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nanna never shied away from hard work but had endless fun as her family grew to 12 childrenânine of them survivingâ42 grandchildren, 100 great-grandchildren, 63 great-great-grandchildren and six great-great-great-grandchildren. Her descendants currently number 223. I am honoured to call some of nanna's family my very good friends and I join with them in honouring this wonderful womanâNolia Ramsamy. May she rest in peace.</span>

Today, Barbara Parsons of Ocean Grove reaches a very significant milestone: she turns 100. In 1944, Barbara met pilot Boz Parsons while he was on leave from service, flying bombers out of the NT. She was working as a physio with the Royal Australian Air Force at the time and served her country with distinction. They became penpals and in 1947 they married. Boz told <span style="font-style:italic;">Women's Day</span> the minute he saw Barbara he knew she was the one. It is a true story of romance which endures to this day. Barbara and Boz, who is 102ânot out himselfâwill soon celebrate their 75th wedding anniversary. Their enduring love for one another is an inspiration to us all. On behalf of the deputy Labor leader, I wish Barbara Parsons a very happy 100th birthday.</span>

The draft boundaries which were released last week see the abolition of the federal division of Stirling, the one that I represent. Stirling division will now most likely be merged out into the four neighbouring divisions. Today I want to assure the people of Stirling, from Trigg to Tuart Hill and every home in between, that I will keep fighting for you.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst these boundaries are not confirmed, our office is 100 per cent open for business. We will keep listening to and helping every single person who reaches out to us. We will also support the hundreds of community, cultural and volunteer organisations in Stirling who really make up the fabric of our wonderful community. As we continue our COVID-19 recovery, it is critical that every person, every community group, every organisation in Australia continues to make the most of every opportunity. We need to continue to grow our sovereign industrial capabilities and to drive down energy costs. It is also critical, and I will keep contributing to fiercely defending Australia and our national interests at home and within our region of the Indo-Pacific.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  I would like to share a truly exceptional lifetime achievement by two people in my electorate. Any wedding anniversary is worth celebrating, but Colin and Daphne Holdsworth of Redbank Plains have a love for the ages. Last Tuesday, they celebrated a special diamond anniversary, 75 years of marriage, a milestone that not many people are lucky enough to reach. Colin is 94 and Daphne is 96. I am told they are as happy today as they were when they tied the knot. They have created quite a legacy with 10 children and more than 80 descendants and, with that, many loving family members. I have no doubt they have received a mountain of congratulations on this special day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Colin and Daphne were thrilled to receive a letter from the Queen and their elected representatives congratulating them on this occasion. They celebrated their anniversary by supporting a great local institution, heading to the Goodna Services Club for a romantic lunch. At a time when it seems there is a lot of bad news to talk about, Colin and Daphne's story is a shining example of the significant impact that love can have. Their story has brought a lot of happiness to our local community, and I would like to congratulate them on their enduring relationship. Mr and Mrs Holdsworth: I wish you all the very best for the years to come.</span>

A consultative committee comprised of local community leaders met to assess the applications received. Mullaloo Surf Life Saving Club was allocated $20,000 to equip its first aid room to treat injuries sustained by beachgoers. Sorrento Surf Life Saving Club received $14,000 for the purchase of an all-terrain vehicle and radio communications equipment to patrol our beaches. The Joondalup Men's Shed was allocated $18,000 for the purchase of a 12-seater minibus to transport participants to and from the workshop. Cycling Without Age received $7,500 for the purchase of a new trishaw to take elderly and disabled residents on coastal rides and The Spiers Centre received $12,000 for the purchase of equipment to be used in providing relief services to local families.</span>

The private assessors who are employed at the NDIS do not necessarily have the expertise or experience in the range of disabilities and conditions they assess. This is the case for my constituent Megan Wedderburn and her daughter Indiana. Tomorrow is Epilepsy Awareness Day and Indiana has the most aggressive and treatment-resistant type of epilepsy that I have seen; she is in hospital every week. I have had the pleasure of meeting Indi on many occasions and she's a lovely girl who has a severe disability.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS should be providing an epilepsy awareness dog for her. That's what we have requested so that the seizures can be recognised before they occur. Instead, she has been denied this and the NDIS is providing strangers to give 24-hour surveillance of Indi in her home at a massive 40 times the cost to the Australian taxpayer of an epilepsy awareness dog. This is wrong; they should get what they want and what they need.</span>

I've had countless constituents approach me with concerns that they've been assessed on a set of criteria which do not reflect any expert knowledge of their condition. It must change.</span>

But, engulfed in scandal, the Morrison government has been paralysed in the face of this very serious national security risk. We have seen no press conference from the Prime Minister and the defence minister, as we saw in June last year in the face of an analogous cybersecurity risk. The defence minister was on leave when this cybersecurity incident hit and the acting defence minister, also the Minister for Women, was in hiding when this cybersecurity incident hit. And three months after he was appointed the new assistant minister for defence, who, theoretically, is supposed to have responsibility for cybersecurity in the Morrison government, hadn't received the charter letter formally giving him these responsibilities.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian cybersecurity has been left politically leaderless under the Morrison government, because of the scandal and incompetence of this government. And to add insult to injury, today we learned that the Minister for Government Services is now in line to become the new home affairs minister in the scandal-enforced reshuffle and that he will have responsibility for cybersecurity policy. After eight long years of scandal and sleaze have decimated the coalition frontbench, this is what we're left with: 'the Minister for My Bad and a Fictitious DDoS Account', 'the member for $40,000 Home Internet Bills' and the master of disaster will now be leading Australian cybersecurity policy. Is this seriously the best that the Morrison government can offer the Australian public? The Australian people deserve better on this issue of serious national importance, and Albanese Labor is ready to provide it.</span>

Just today the <span style="font-style:italic;">Herald Sun</span> reports that Victoria's construction industry is struggling to find the specialised tradespeople that it needs, driving up prices during a boom in building activity. A survey of Masters Builders Association members found that more than two-thirds were experiencing trade delays. An average delay of 15 days was occurring for concreters, bricklayers and joiners. Then you go on seek.com and you see thousands of hospitality jobs that remain unfilled.

These are proud Bidjigal men. Their ancestors stood on the shore of Kamay, or Botany Bay, in 1770 when Captain Cook's ship sailed through the heads of the bay and changed the lives of First Nations Australians forever. These men have just visited the National Museum to view a set of spears on display at the museum as part of the story of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Endeavour</span> voyage from the shore. These spears were stolen by Cook and his men from the ancestors of these great Australians in the gallery today. They are vitally important Australian cultural artefacts, but they are not kept in Australia. They are on loan from the Cambridge museum, like thousands of other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander artefacts. They are not accessible by their rightful owners. These men cannot tell their children and their grandchildren the story of the importance of these artefacts. As a gesture of truth-telling, as a gesture of recognition and as a gesture of reconciliation, all these artefacts and others should be returned to their people in Australia, where requested. They belong on country with their ancestors. The Australian government must facilitate, through consultation with First Australians and foreign governments, a process for the return of significant Aboriginal artefacts. I welcome these men today and I am proud to be associated with you. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:58</span>):  Two and a half thousand years ago, the ancient Greeks built the foundation of our modern democratic traditions. Democracy, translated from the Greek for 'people power', even in its earliest forms, represented concepts we hold dear today: liberty, freedom and government by the people. Yet that freedom was not to be enduring for the Greek people, and, in more recent history, Greece found itself under the yoke of Ottoman rule for more than four centuries. That was to change following the fight for independence that started 200 years ago this week. The bicentennial of Greek independence is being celebrated not just by those of Greek heritage but also by many others who admire the determination of the Greek people to re-establish their own identity, their own liberty and their own future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Such is the significance of this event, many of the world's great landmarks will be lit in blue and white, including the Sydney Opera House. Australia has been the beneficiary of Greek migration, and we're grateful to those who made the journey across the world to create a new life on our shores. North Sydney is home to many people of Greek heritage, and at the heart of that is the Greek Orthodox parish, centred at St Michael's in Crows Nest. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to Father John Daskalakis, who is retiring, and wish his successor well, and I acknowledge Parish Council President Dimitrios Gongolidis for his leadership. I know that they will be marking this important day and no doubt remembering that enduring cry that united those fighting for liberty 200 years ago: 'Eleftheria i thanatos.'</span>

Through their hospitality, Victorian Muslims helped the wider community to combat Islamophobia and hate speech and to see beyond the negative and skewed media reports. The ICV's Victorian Mosque Open Day was launched in 2017 as part of Cultural Diversity Week and Harmony Week. Thousands of Victorians attended a local mosque and got to know their Muslim neighbours and learn about the Islamic faith and the diversity of Muslims. Visitors were treated to guided tours, hijab tutorials and henna and tattoo art.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister and Minister for the Public Service</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:01</span>):  Today, together with the Leader of the Opposition, I acknowledge it's a special day for people of Greek heritage, including in this House but also right across the country and, indeed, in the homeland of Greece. Today marks the bicentennial of the modern Greek state. I extend congratulations to all the Greek people, in particular to Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakisâa very good friend of Australia. I appreciate his great friendship in the many issues we've been dealing with, particularly in relation to COVID-19. They have been a fellow traveller as we've been working through those issues. I greatly appreciate his input and his recognition, also very generously, of the way that Australia has dealt with these issues. He's taken a keen interest in Australians of Greek heritage, and I know that he would welcome this statement from our parliament today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a wonderful milestone for these proud people of a very ancient land. Greece has given so much to the world: the wisdom of their ancients; the tales of their gods and heroes; the Olympic questâsomething South-East Queensland is very thrilled about!âcelebrating that Olympic spirit to be faster, higher and stronger; and, indeed, the first dawn of democracy now shared with so much of the world. Let's work together to ensure that more of the world can share in great democratic traditions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has been blessed by its fellow citizens who are of Greek heritage. It's a wonderful community, grounded in family and faith, and a people with a fierce prideâfrom the local Paragon milk bars to the neighbours who share plates of baklava and to the contributions here in this chamber. In so many places in our national life the Greek influence has added so much to our great multicultural society. It's a joyous passion added to our national life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Greek friends always add to our communities. They build them up and open them up. Importantly, through the great waves of migration to this country, they brought their fellow Greeks to this country and surrounded them in a welcoming way at a time so many years ago, particularly in the fifties and the sixties, when our migrant support services were not what they are today. It was the local Greek orthodox parish priest and the many others who worked in those faith communities who put their arms around those communities and ensured they got off to such a successful start in life here in Australia. Our Greek friends do this each and every day to this day. Attributes that originally were so Greek are now very Australian, and the two are meshed closely together. In recent days Archbishop Makarios has reminded me that on this bicentenary some of the customary celebrations aren't taking place, including that wonderful joyous gathering at the Sydney Opera House. But there will be smaller celebrations that are no less joyous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank our Greek community for the sacrifices that they, like so many others, have made during this pandemic. I thank them for their contribution to our national life. I honour our Greek friends and the Greek nation. We have stood side by side in great conflicts and sought the same democratic freedoms, liberties and peace as we do to this day together. Happy independence day. Zito i Ellas!</span>

This is a proud day to be Greek. It is 200 years since the revolt in the Peloponnese saw a people rise to their feet and bring to an end centuries of occupation. Their cry of eleftheria i thanatos, freedom or death, has lost none of its power. Of course, our connection with Greece is profound. An Australia without Greeks is simply beyond imagining. We are home to such a large part of the Greek diaspora. Melbourne alone has the biggest Greek-speaking population outside of Greece bar none. It's something we take great pride in as Australians. From our capital cities to our country towns, Greeks have done so much to shape the face of our modern nation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to say my own electorate of Grayndler, especially my home suburb of Marrickville, has long been a Greek stronghold. I was at St Nicholas parish church around the corner from my home just two weeks ago on a Sunday to once again commemorate mass there and to participate in the gathering that happens after in the church hall every Sunday, where they share food, stories and provide support for each other. Indeed, this place is enhanced by the members for Calwell and Adelaide, and they will certainly be celebrating today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My good friend Archbishop Makarios has done an extraordinary job in the short time that he has been in Australia, following on from the wonderful work of his eminence Archbishop Stylianos over a long period of time. To his eminence and all of the community and all of the parishes around Australia, I say zito i Ellas, long live Greece!</span>

Can he confirm that this is a fund that has an annual allocation for both recovery and mitigation, and the figures there are zero and zero that have been spent?

There has been no hesitation from this government to ensure that we're providing the support that is necessary. The Leader of the Opposition would well know because time and again, whether in this chamber or elsewhere, we have made it very clear that the funds he refers to are drawn upon after all other funds, which have been significantâ$2 billion alone for bushfires has been rolling out, the funds that have been provided to devastated flood victims, the funds that have been provided for COVID assistance. I'll ask the minister to add further, but the real questions are: What are this Leader of the Opposition's boundaries? On what issue will he not politicise? Even in the midst of floodwaters which have still not yet receded there is nothing this Leader of the Opposition will not play political games with.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister and Minister for the Public Service</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:11</span>):  I welcome the member for Berowra back to the chamber. He went to his electorate yesterday to provide that assistance. And to those other members who are not in this place, I thank them for the work that they're continuing to doâthe member for Lindsay in particular. There are members opposite also who are not with us. The member for Berowra, amongst all of us, would be most upset by the news, as we discovered yesterday, of a man's body being discovered in floodwaters near Glenorie, which is in the member's electorate, and I know the member is incredibly saddened by that news. We also learned, sadly, soon afterwards that according to Queensland police a man's body was discovered in an upturned vehicle in floodwaters at Canungra, in the electorate of the Assistant Minister for Road Safety and Freight Transport. We urge, again: if it's flooded, forget it. Don't go into those waters, on foot, in a vehicle or anything else.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Berowra has relayed to me the extraordinary work that is occurring on the ground in his community, whether that's delivering groceries for families who have been isolated due to flooded roads, or the goods being donated by families from the Glenorie Public School. The member reminds me that, just like so many other affected communitiesâand this is occurring in his electorate and across New South Wales and across Queenslandâpeople are helping each other and preparing for the hard work ahead when the waters recede, damage is assessed and the arduous task of the clean-up begins. State governments are commencing their damage assessments, and I want to thank premiers, whether in Queensland or New South Wales in particular, for the great work that their agencies are doing across their great states. These are highly professional, competent agenciesâthe world's best when it comes to assistance in relation to floods and so many other natural disasters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a great advantage in having those capacities within our state governments. And where their resources are unable to deal with a matter then they are quick to refer that to the federal government, as indeed the New South Wales Premier has today in relation to C&amp;D assistanceâwhat we've been anticipating and the works we've been putting in place with the defence forces to be able respond quickly to those arrangements. So we are poised and we are moving already. The Australian Defence Force is in the process of deploying over 500 personnel to staging areas in Taree, Port Macquarie and Kempsey to assist the State Emergency Service to undertake activities, including debris clearance, clearance of roads to facilitate access, and clearance of other flood and storm debris to support access to critical infrastructure and essential servicesâsandbagging and clean-up. We expect the ADF contribution to go to around 700 personnel. I can also update the House that $25 million and more is now being paid out by Services Australia, with over 22,000 phone callsâthousands of great public servants doing their job, taking those calls, providing that support. We stand with you.</span>

The Prime Minister will rip away JobKeeper from more than a million Australians in just three days time. Treasury has warned that up to 150,000 Australians currently on JobKeeper will lose their jobs, but it's been revealed that the government's hiring credit scheme has only supported 609 jobs. How many Australians will be left behind by this government when the Prime Minister rips away JobKeeper this Sunday?</span>

As the Treasury secretary has already stated, the impacts that are being felt in our economy do not lead to the conclusion of Treasury that that would lead to a rise in unemployment. But we will deal with the issues as they continue to present. What we know is that the number of people employed in this country is greater todayâin fact, back in Februaryâthan it was when the recession and the pandemic hit this country. We've still got a long way to go, there's no doubt about that. But now that we have returned to a position better than when the pandemic started, in terms of the number of people employed in this countryâwe said that emergency assistance would be temporary and that it would be targeted.</span>

That is an important thing that governments must have in responding to a crisis. But our government also understands that you cannot run the Australian economy on taxpayers' money forever. You also need the fiscal discipline of a government that the taxpayers can trust to know when you need to provide that support and as your economy growsâ</span>

Indeed, Senator Henderson and I visited Cotton On in the member's electorate, a business employing more than 5,000 Australians. The member for Corio wasn't there. We were there to celebrate the fact that it has also graduated off JobKeeper and to also celebrate the fact that, in the member's own electorate, they were making an investment in the expansion of their distribution centre, creating more than 100 new jobs. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

As we meet, there are families in Australia who are mourning loved ones who have been lost in this crisis. It is a tragedy.

This is not the time to be complacent. Yes, outside here the sun is shining, and the sun is shining in many parts of Australia, but the floodwaters are indeed still rising. We do not know the extent of damage caused by these floods, by this crisis and by this tragedy, but rest assured that when the water recedesâand it willâwe will be there to mop up, to clean up, to recover and to rebuild.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is paramount that those people in the affected areas listen to the advice of the local emergency service personnel and follow itâadhere to it, please! The National Heavy Vehicle Regulator is continuing its important work in supporting road operations and managers, ensuring the safe delivery of fresh produce and medical supplies to those areas in need wherever they might be. When the floodwaters recede we will rebuild. Our $110 billion pipeline of investment in infrastructure is designed to do just that. There is a significant rebuilding task ahead of us; we know that, and we're prepared to do it. By working with state and local authorities on this we will ensure that clear priorities are set and met. We will rebuild and we will re-establish major transport network links wherever they might be.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr HUNT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Cabinet and Minister for Health and Aged Care</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:24</span>):  I want to thank the member for Mayo, who brought this to my attention a couple of days ago. There are three principles to the Australian vaccination program: firstly, it's free; secondly, it's voluntary; and, thirdly, it's universally available, with enough vaccine for every Australian three times over.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, with regard to the specific question that you raised, I've received an example from your office with a specific practice. We've referred that immediately to the department and they are following up. Secondly, the notion that it is free has been reaffirmed with peak providers as it has been and is overwhelmingly, I believe, other than the case I've heard from you, the case around the country. Thirdly, we have reaffirmed the advice which has been provided publicly. I will read this for the benefit of the House in relation to the formal advice of the Australian government Department of Health:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Vaccination providers cannot charge to administer the COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccine is free and the consult appointment for patients to receive their vaccinations is also freeâ</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">exactly that which you have raised, and:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Charging a patient any costs associated with the administration of the COVID-19 vaccination (including booking fees) is a breach of the requirements under the program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So that has been the case, that is the case and that will continue to be the case. Where there are examples such as those that have been raised by the member we will take them up. I do want to say more generally, though, our GPs have been magnificent. They are doing an extraordinary job. What we've seen this week is a rapid escalation in the number of doses that have been administered as the general practice phase 1b program has begun.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week we had 30,000 doses administered on Monday and over 46,000 doses administered on Tuesday. The figures just received show 49Â½ thousand doses administered on Wednesday. So that rapid growth, which had always been intended for this week, is occurring. Over 126,000 doses have been administered over the course of the first three days of this week. Significantly, we have now passed the 400,000 dose mark in Australia, with 408,000 doses, and those numbers are escalating rapidly and daily. We're only able to do this because of the help of our magnificent GPs using that primary health network. Very importantly, we had the floods and the impact on distribution, which everyone was aware of. A couple of days ago there were 38 practices still looking for their first deliveries. That's now down to one in Taree, where the practice is still battling flood conditions. We've achieved that result and second-week vaccination deliveries are on their way already, and I thank our GPs.</span>

In the honourable member's electorate more than 24,000 people have graduated off JobKeeper. Across Queensland more than 550,000 people have graduated off JobKeeper. The member for Moncrieff, like those on this side of the House, is working hard to create more jobs across the economy, as we recover from the biggest economic shock since the Great Depression.</span>

I've had the opportunity to visit electorates right across the country and meet those small business people and their workers who have graduated off JobKeeperâlike the cafe in Sturt, the cake shop in Reid, the bicycle shop in Braddon and the construction business in Herbert.

We all saw the heartbreaking images from across the country of tens of thousands of our fellow Australians lining up outside Centrelink. JobKeeper was an economic lifeline in that moment of crisis.

I thank her for speaking up about the vicious ongoing hate campaign that is being waged against her. Her call to 'judge me not by what I look like but by what I do' was heard by women in every corner of the country. The member for Boothby didn't do this for herself, because yesterday she was straight back representing vulnerable disadvantaged women, bringing them to this parliament and speaking up for them. Her voice is incredible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The determination of every member of this parliament, on both sides, to improve the safety of all Australian women is shared by the government and its current actions. I talked about our national partnership on COVID-19 domestic or family violence and how we've helped boost the capacity of states and territories to deliver domestic violence support during the pandemic. That helped address what appeared to be a tragic increase in violence. Isolation and lockdowns, unfortunately, took their toll in pressures on families. There were more than 30,000 additional calls to 1800RESPECT in May, June and July last year than during the previous year. Victoria in particular saw the impact of the tough lockdowns. Twenty per cent more contacted the 1800 service. This funding on the ground helped boost crisis hotlines, women's refuges, surges in case workers, flexible support packages of funding and emergency accommodation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But online safety is also an important focus of the government. The minister for communications will soon introduce a new online safety act. This act will include establishing a world-first cyberabuse takedown scheme for Australian adults, based on the success of our cyberbullying scheme for childrenâ'It's not appropriate; take it down'âreducing the time frame that providers need to remove image based abuse, cyberabuse, cyberbullying and seriously harmful online content. It's now at 48 hours. It's going down to 24 hours. If something like that is up there about you or a vulnerable woman or, indeed, anyoneâand the member for Boothby knows this only too wellâtake it down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's always more work to do. For rural women, who need a safe place to go, for women everywhere, who demand respectful and safe workplaces, and for everyone who deserves to be safe online we are determined to change and change for the better.</span>

I'm proud of the fact we've got a Deputy Prime Minister who has overseen record infrastructure funding and has kept planes in the sky during the COVID-19 pandemic. I'm very proud of the Treasurer, who stood with me and announced our single biggest economic intervention, which has saved Australian lives and livelihoods through the course of the pandemic and has seen job numbers return to the level we saw pre-pandemic. I'm incredibly proud of the minister for health. I'm proud of his efforts to see Australia through and to ensure that Australia stands amongst a small band of countries as we lead the world out of the COVID pandemic. On top of that, at the same time, he continues to preside over one of the most successful pharmaceutical benefits schemes in the world.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm incredibly proud of Minister Cash, our deputy leader in the Senate, who has put in place the JobTrainer program which is seeing more than 300,000 additional training places this year, right in the middle of the pandemic. The minister for industry is reigniting manufacturing and getting Australians back into work and manufacturing shop floors all over the country. I'm very proud of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, because our Minister for Foreign Affairs is doing a massive job of standing up for Australia, bringing together with other world leaders the Quad and bringing into this place the foreign relations bill, which is a stand-up for Australia's sovereignty like we have never seen in this country, I suspect, before.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I could mention the foreign interference legislation, which was such a critical act pulled together by the Attorney-General. I commend him for the job that he has done on that. Of course, we have the Minister for Home Affairs, who continues to keep those boats stopped. But, more than that, boats that those opposite started when they sat in those portfolios have been stopped by this government and remain stopped under this Minister for Home Affairs, who has done more to combat child sexual abuse than anyone who has sat in his role before.</span>

I'm happy for the Leader of the Opposition to move an extension of time, but I suspect he won't. The minister for communications, together with the Treasurer and I, stood up to the global tech giants and ensured we got the right outcome for Australians.

They have supported Australians magnificently, along with our pathologists and our aged-care workersâall of those associated with primary care right around the country. They have helped to deliver another day of zero cases of community transmission. That's the 53rd day for this year. Sixty-three per cent of days over the course of 2021 have seen no cases in Australia within the community and, extraordinarily, no lives lost. And yet we know, at the same time around the world, in the last 24 hours there were 578,000 cases with, extraordinarily, 9,700 lives lost. These are astronomical figures, compared to the zero cases in Australia and the zero lives lost in the course of 2021.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We owe an enormous debt of gratitude to our primary carers. This week phase 1b has started. We've seen over 1,000 primary carers, through our GPs, in the field. As I mentioned earlier, we've seen a rapid acceleration in the doses being delivered. We've seen our over-eighties, our over-seventies, our Indigenous Australians over 55, those with chronic health conditions and our general health workers being supported. All of these things are about saving lives and protecting lives here in Australia. This number will build. It will build to over 4,000 primary practices over the course of the coming months. In particular, it's also seeing the support for our aged-care residents. We now have over 71,000 aged-care residents that have been vaccinated, with 708 aged-care residential facilities that have had first doses and 130 aged-care facilities that have now had second doses. Our most frail Australians are being protected, and, progressively, so are more and more Australians. It's about saving lives and protecting lives. It's about the work of our primary carers. It will expand in phase 2 to our pharmacists. We see that this is providing the confidence around the country, which sees that no borders are closed from any state to any other state at the moment. We're seeing the ability, when there were outbreaks in Queensland and New South Wales, for states to remain open. These programs are coming togetherâthe economic and the healthâsaving lives, protecting lives and protecting livelihoods, because of the incredible work of our primary carers.</span>

I'm very confident about all the members of my cabinet. Yes, I am, because they continue to perform in their roles. I refer, particularly, to the Minister for Defence and the great role that she has played in cabinet. As the Minister for Defence, she, at the time of the bushfires, already had prepared and planned for the biggest single call-out of the Reserve, to ensure they could respond to Operation Bushfire Assist. That was an extraordinary effort by our defence forcesâsomething those opposite mocked. I would caution them against mocking the call-out of our defence forces to assist Australians at their greatest time of need, and I thank the Minister for Defence for the great work she has done on that matter.</span>

Maybe I'll have to add to an answer later, Mr Speaker, because there are quite a number of others whose achievements I am very keen to speak ofâincluding the Minister for the Environment, who does an amazing job on the recycling revolution in this country. I have great confidence in the members of my cabinet. The Leader of the Opposition can't even have enough confidence in his shadow Treasurer to keep him in the job! He's had to put in someone to oversight himâthe Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I have great confidence in my cabinet members; they have great confidence in me.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr LITTLEPROUD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management and Deputy Leader of the National Party</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:47</span>):  I thank the member for Robertson for her question and for her concern about the communities impacted by the current flooding events. While we cast our minds to the recovery efforts, the events of the last 24 hours are a tragic reminder of the dangers that lie there. The sun might be shining but it's still unsafe to go into those waters. No job, appointment, house or car is more important than your life. Please be patient, help is on the way. Up to 700 ADF personnel are spread across the eastern seaboard to support those communities in their recovery. There are five helicopters, also from the ADF, in support of those communities. In the next hour, I'll be signing an instrument to add another 26 New South Wales local government areas to the 34 where people are already eligible for assistance of $1,000 per adult and $400 per child and 13 weeks worth of income support for those who have had income taken away from them as a result of this event. We'll work through that as our immediate and initial support.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have learnt so much from what has happened to this country over the last couple of years. Two years ago, nearly to the day, we had devastating floods in north-west Queenslandâfrom Townsville out into the north-west. We lost half a million head of livestock. The cattle industry was decimated in 24 hours. Yet we stood up with the state government of Queensland and provided over $3.3 billion. We made sure those people knew we were there to support them not just in a physical sense but also in an emotional sense. In every tragedy we have faced as a nation, mental health has played a significant part in making sure we rebuild not just people's livelihoods but also their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have done this also with the enduring drought. It's important to understand that, while this rain event has been quite widespread, parts of central-west Queensland are still in drought, particularly in my electorate of Maranoa. We'll continue to commit to those people with the nearly $11 billion put aside by the Australian taxpayers by supporting them through the national drought strategyâsupporting them in the here and nowâby making sure they have the dignity and respect of being able to put bread and butter on their table for their families and by supporting those communities that support them, because those communities also do it tough. When farmers don't have money, they don't spend in town, and we need to support them through these trying times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have looked to the future with the Future Drought Fund, with $100 billion being rolled out as we speakâthis isn't my fund; this is a farmers' fund being led by Brent Finlay, the former NFF president, to make sure it goes to where it's needed to build resilienceâand the Bushfire Relief Fund, over $2.2 billion, of which $1.5 billion has gone out of the Commonwealth's pockets into the pockets of those who need it the most, the victims. We'll continue to roll out the last part of that, which is about long-term economic recovery, which communities decide. So no matter the disaster, the Australian government will stand shoulder to shoulder with those who have been impacted by the disasters.</span>

This question simply refers to the comments by Peta Credlin but then asks: has the government contacted her in order to identify the staffers?

It's those facts that are the reason for the question, not the fact there's a statement from Peta Credlin.</span>

I understand the point that the Leader of the House is making and I certainly considered the wording of the earlier questions when they came up. I didn't simply allow them because there was no objection. I mean, as you well know, I have ruled out questions. These are all covered in the standing orders and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Practice</span>, where it is a question about a statement a government backbencher might have made because the Prime Minister has no responsibility for those. I think the difference here, though, is very much the nature of the question with respect to government MPs and staff more generally, which is why I allowed the question yesterday and I will allow it again today. In doing so, of course there's some latitude in how it's answered because, as I pointed out, on many occasions, some of these questions, you allow them but it doesn't mean it's necessarily within the capacity of the minister answering to be able to answer it or answer straightaway. </span>

I thank the member also for that question. A similar question was asked yesterday by the member for Gorton. These are very serious matters and the government is taking them very seriously. Where matters such as this can be pursued then we will. But I don't think it is helpful to provide a running commentary on such sensitive matters and how any inquiries on these things may be being pursued. I don't think that's a very responsible thing to do here. We have spent quite a bit of time here in recent weeks talking about the importance of process in relation to how complaints or issues may arise regarding the conduct of staff or others in this place. I propose to honour that in how I deal with these things. I would encourage others to follow the same practice.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is investing a record $270 billion in our defence capability and is creating thousands of jobs and providing opportunities for Australia's defence industry. Last Friday I had the great pleasure of visiting the Shoalhaven region with my dear friend from the other side Senator Jim Molan. In that region, we met a number of people, in particular, the Shoalhaven Defence Industry GroupâSaab, Lockheed Martinâand we also met Australian SME Global Defence Solutions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At Global Defence Solutions we had the great pleasure of meeting some of their young Australian workers. We met three young peopleâBrendan, Madison and Lauraâwho are working hard on behalf of the Australian people and the ADF. They're producing a cutting-edge camouflage material. What a great joy it was to meet Laura, because she had only just started her apprenticeship. It was a great opportunity to learn from her. Effectively, these young people are industrial seamstresses. What they're doing is hard workâit's heavy workâbut they need great attention to detail. I have to say that I was incredibly proud to meet those three young people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Global Defence Solutions has secured multiple contracts with the ADF and is creating many, many opportunities in the Shoalhaven region. One of the opportunities we learned of is that, together with other businesses in the region, they have stepped up to support our COVID response to Papua New Guinea. This joint effort is providing locally made deployable medical shelters for Papua New Guinea, and can I say that they were very proud to be involved in that project. Thanks to the Morrison government, the Shoalhaven area is going from strength to strength.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During my visit to the Shoalhaven I also visited the incredible personnel at HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Albatross</span>. I'd like to extend my deep thanks to and my admiration for the men and women of HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Albatross</span>, who serve the nation all the time but who did so particularly during the bushfires in the region during Black Summer. These same people are stepping up again, in particular 808 Squadron, who are conducting search-and-rescue operations with respect to the New South Wales floods: well done to them. This was a great opportunity to meet those people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I will just say a big happy birthday to the Australian Air Force, which turns 100 next week. That's 100 years of protecting our nation and 100 years of reaching for the skies. Well done! This Morrison government is getting on with the job of defending our nation. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr FLETCHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Communications, Urban Infrastructure, Cities and the Arts</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:00</span>):  I thank the member for Goldstein. He is a very big supporter of the arts and entertainment sector. He loves a show; he loves a bit of razzle-dazzle, the member for Goldstein! And of course so many Australians love a show, and increasingly Australians have a chance to go and see our talented performers as they're treading the boards, thanks to our $75 million, to date, RISEâRestart Investment to Sustain and ExpandâFund, launched last year and right now supporting 115 productions, events, festivals, concerts and tours, such as: the Adelaide Fringe Festival, the Melbourne Fringe Festival, Circa's <span style="font-style:italic;">Shaun the Sheep</span> show, the Woodfordia folk festival, the Byron Bay Bluesfest, the Terrapin Puppet Theatre in Tasmania, <span style="font-style:italic;">Bluey's Big Play</span><span style="font-style:italic;">:</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> The Stage Show</span>, the musicals <span style="font-style:italic;">Hamilton</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Harry Potter</span>, the Flying Fruit Fly Circus, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Very Hungry Caterpillar</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>show, and much, much more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But wait: there is much, much more, because we've committed another $125 million of RISE funding to get performers back on stage, to get the crews backstage doing their vital work, to get front of houseâthe ushers, box officeâback in. We're supporting the arts and entertainment sector. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer are backing these sectors very strongly. And of course when you go and see a show it's very likely that you'll go to a bar, a cafe or a restaurant. You might even book a night at a hotel. You might even book an air ticket to fly interstate to see a big musical or a big show. So, this is about jobsâ90,000 jobs in the arts and entertainment sector and across the economy. And we're changing the guidelines of the RISE program so that it will work even better for the music sector, to help them get back on their feet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that when it comes to supporting our performers, supporting the music sector, supporting theatre, supporting circus, supporting operaâwhatever it isâthe Liberal-Nationals Morrison government is backing the arts sector. From the opposition there have been tweets of support. From this side there has been serious funding, supporting the arts sector. We know that with COVID it's been a tough 12 months for Australians. So, what better way to lift your spirits than to go and see a show featuring talented Aussie performers? Thankfully today's announcement about an additional $125 million means more jobs, more shows, more great performers like Tina Arenaâthe Prime Minister's favouriteâand more razzle-dazzle. Let's bring it on.</span>

The Tasmanian Premier has now confirmed that Speaker Hickey raised the matter with him a few weeks ago and has separately written to the Prime Minister asking him to consider the matters raised. Since he received the Premier's letter, what steps has the Prime Minister taken to investigate Speaker Hickey's claims? Has he spoken to Senator Abetz?</span>

He simply noted the statement that had been made, under privilege, in the Tasmanian parliament. He then noted the complete denial of that statement by Senator Abetz, and that's where the matter rests. It's a matter of comment that of course, were that to be the case, that would be repugnant. But those comments have been absolutely denied by Senator Abetz. A senator of long-time standing in this place has made that statement. He's made it openly, as a complete denial of what has been put against him. I have not been party to that conversation, like the member who has raised the question. The denial that Senator Abetz has put forward is there on the open record.</span>

Maeve's law was introduced to this parliament yesterday. I had the privilege of doing that on behalf not just of the government but of all members. It is a law for mitochondrial donation. It's a groundbreaking law. It's a matter about which the Prime Minister has a deep personal passion, as does the member for McMahon. It crosses all boundaries. It's named after a little girl from my electorate, Maeve Hood. Maeve is five years old. She's one of those children born every weekâ56 children per year, more than one a weekâwith very serious forms of mitochondrial disease. That means they are likely to face a degenerative condition as organs and respiratory processes begin to fail. Very few who have that condition make it past the age of five. Maeve is five years old, and her parents, Joel and Sarah, have said that every day is a blessing.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This law, if passed by the House and the Senate, will open up the prospect of real hope and real change for these familiesâthat, with mitochondrial donation, we will have the ability to bring these children into the world without the risk of mitochondrial disease. Their lives will be transformed. Their families' lives will be transformed. We're doing this at the same time as we've been battling COVID but going ahead with all the other important things. There couldn't be a more important law and there couldn't be a more important change in so many ways.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, we're progressing with Mackenzie's Mission. Many of you will remember that little Mackenzie Casella lost her battle at seven months and 11 days with spinal muscular atrophy, the most agonising and debilitating of conditions. In her honour we named Mackenzie's Mission, and the Prime Minister, when he was the Treasurer, announced funding of $20 million for thousands and thousands of families to have access to carrier screening, which would then allow them, if they were carrying up to now 1,300 different genetic conditions, to seek IVF. That's now occurring, and thousands of families are enrolled in Mackenzie's Mission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mackenzie's parents, Jonny and Rachael, have had their own struggle to have a second child. They've been through IVF and they've been through hell. But I am absolutely privileged to announce that last Friday little Mackenzie had a brother born. Whilst Mackenzie is no longer with us, Isaac Casella has been born. Isaac's grandfather is Ross, who works in this parliament. It is a tribute to the determination of their family, a tribute to medical science and a tribute to this program that we have in Australia this little boy, Isaac Casella.</span>

It applies to both sides. You have 30 seconds. It is completely unacceptable to interject when I'm enforcing the standing orders. You expect me to enforce them. You have up to 30 seconds and if a question can't be asked in that time then there's no question. I have done the same thing with the member for Kennedy on a number of occasions and actually met approval for doing so.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have the worst health conditions, and we would expect the figures for COVID impacting them to be much more significant than what they have been. But we need to remember that there has not been a single death within the Aboriginal community from COVID and that, as of 1 March, only 150 have tested positive to COVID-19.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday I had the privilege of having a vaccine with the member for Barton. We both attended the Winnunga Aboriginal Medical Service, along with Tom Calma and elders Loretta Halloran and Caroline Hughes. We sat there and we talked about the importance of why we need to encourage Indigenous Australians to have the vaccine. I don't know about the member for Barton; it was fine at the time, but I felt it later on in the afternoon! The work that the Aboriginal medical services are doing is absolutely important and the work that my agency is doing with Minister Hunt's agency in coordinating the effort geographically across this nation for First Nations is absolutely critical and important.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have 32 Aboriginal community controlled health organisations currently involved in the distribution of the vaccine to over-55s and to those with extreme chronic conditions, because we want to protect as many as possible. We are building to around 100 services for around 300 sites across Australia, and that is important. Messages are going out in language. There are 15 languages that the Department of Health, working with NACCHO and the community controlled health sector, are using to ensure that those messages go across the Indigenous media networks so that people are informed of the opportunities that they have. And we're working very closely with each state and territory to ensure that we reach as many people as possible. The Morrison government will continue to work with all of those who play a very critical role. But I do want to acknowledge the Minister for Health for the way in which he has given significant focus to the needs of Indigenous Australians.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the break, I would really appreciate any members who are out in their electorates and meeting with Aboriginal communities to encourage them to access the services. The Aboriginal grapevine will be effective, but you will play an important role in helping us to keep Indigenous Australians safe. Thank you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:15</span>):  Well, after eight long years what we've seen over this last fortnight is a tired, stale government that's unravelling before our eyes, disintegrating before our eyes. There are real challenges before this country. The challenge of overcoming the pandemic. The challenge of overcoming the deep recession, insecure work, increased frequency of natural disasters, but what we have from this government is no agenda, no idea. It's just occupying the space. The whole obsession about political managementâan accountability black hole. It's a government that doesn't believe that it should have to answer questions either here or in press conferences, a government that will never take responsibility. We have a Prime Minister who doesn't hold a hose and doesn't call an inquiry. There's no accountability when it comes to bushfires, when it comes to aged careânot even the reported sexual assault of Brittany Higgins just metres from the Prime Minister's office two years ago. We know that ministers knew. We know that members of his staff knew. We know that people in the parliamentary system knew. But what did we get from this Prime Minister? That he didn't know until the Monday in which the report became public, even though over that weekend his office was dealing with the media inquiries from news.com.au and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Project</span>. The idea that this Prime Minister, who is an ultimate control freak, would not know what was going on over that weekend, as his office was preparing responses, is, quite frankly, just absurd.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know also, with regard to the Attorney-General, that when documentation was given to him, he didn't even bother to read the complaint. He didn't bother to read the complaint. Then when we asked about his office's involvement he set up a review by his former chief of staff into what his current staff knew over that two-year period, the Gaetjens review. Then he misled parliament about it. When we asked clear questions he said that he hadn't received any updateâbut he had. On 9 March he received the update that it had been suspended. It was a complete untruth, a complete and deliberate mislead before this parliament. But this Prime Minister had contempt for it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, of course, we saw today, after two weeks of asking every single day for confirmation that what Brittany Higgins told the March 4 Justice outside this building, that the Prime Minister's office had sought to undermine her loved ones, he stonewalled for two weeks. He refused to answer the question. Then today guess what? He announced another review. This is about his own office. Why doesn't he just ask them? He's the Prime Minister of Australia and he can't ask his own chief of staff and his own office staff what is going on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we know, around the alleged Eric Abetz comments, that he hasn't spoken to Eric Abetz. Don't ask, don't tell. The Network 10 revelationsâhe doesn't know anything at all. It's inappropriate. It's on the TV. It is being discussed around the country. That's how we know about it. Yet there are no answers from this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we have the idea that he's going to move aside the Attorney-General without any inquiry. He's going to use advice from the Solicitor-General about whether, because the Attorney-General's taking legal action, it's inappropriate that he shift to another portfolio, but he won't ask the Solicitor-General whether the AG's a fit and proper person to continue in the role. It is just absurd!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then you get down to the reshuffle. We know they've lost a lot of senior people over the last few years, but you're going to have Senator Cash as Attorney-General! She refused to provide a formal statement to a police investigation about the fact that her office gave the media a heads-up to a police raid. She refused to cooperate with the police. You're going to put that person in charge of the legal system in this country. You're going to make her the first law officer of the land.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If that's not bad enough, you're going to move to home affairs the Minister for Government Services. This is the bloke who lost his ministerial job because, when he was Assistant Minister for Defence, he went to China on a privately funded business tripâand the Chinese government thought he was representing the government; he was the assistant defence ministerâfor a business deal that he had a pecuniary interest in. You're going to put him in charge of national security. You couldn't make this up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Prime Minister is an empathy vacuum. He wouldn't attend the March 4 Justice. In the train wreck of an interview, when someone from Sky dared to ask a question, he had the temerity to demand that women stand with him, rather than him standing with them. This is a Prime Minister who has an ear of tin, a heart of stone and a wall of concrete to shield him from the concerns of his fellow Australians. He is an angry man who has mastered the rare art of clenching a glass jaw. That's what this bloke has done.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When this Prime Minister leaves office Australians will ask themselves: 'What was the point of the government? Was it nothing but smoke and mirrors?' What's the big agenda? What's the productivity agenda? What's the social policy agenda? What are they doing to build back better? This Prime Minister used to ask, 'Whose side are you on?' We know whose side he's onâhe's on his own side. We on this side of the House are on the side of the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the coming months we will be saying: 'If you want a government that will use its time in power to make your life better and make Australia better, Labor is on your side. If you see this pandemic as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to build back stronger, Labor is on your side. If you want secure, well-paid jobs, Labor is on your side. If you want child care fixed, because it would be good for families, good for children and good for our economy, Labor is on your side. If you want to embrace Australia's future as a renewable energy superpower, Labor is on your side. If you want Australians trained for the jobs of the future and you want a solution to the skills shortages that are holding back businesses, Labor is on your side. If you understand that aspiration means wanting your children to have a better life than you had, Labor is on your side. If you want the gender pay gap exposed and closed, Labor is on your side. If you want 10 days paid domestic and family violence leave, Labor is on your side. If you believe that older Australians deserve dignity and respect, Labor is on your side. If you want a future made in Australia, Labor is on your side. If you want the security of a superannuation system, Labor is on your side. If you think that government should have something to show for its time in power, whether it is Medicare, the NDIS, infrastructure investment, universal super, the National Broadband Network or paid parental leave, Labor is on your side. If you believe that we need a national integrity commission to restore confidence in our political system, Labor is on your side.'</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want an Australia where no-one is held back and no-one is left behind, an Australia that's inclusive, an Australia that's strong and an Australia that looks to the future with confidence. Australians want a government that doesn't just seek to manage the 24-hour media cycle. This is a government that's out of time and out of ideas. At the next election it should be out of office.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HOGAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Page</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:25</span>):  If we're talking about political slogans, I think we're in no doubt what Labor's political slogan will be at the next electionâand that's 'On your side'. Today's MPI is about the government listening to the Australian public, and I'm going to talk a lot today about the pandemic and how we listened about what we needed to do and also about people's jobs and what we needed to do. But it has also touched on a very important public discussion that started happening in our country five or six weeks ago now, starting with the allegations that Brittany Higgins made, and very tragic and sad they are. Given that the opposition leader did bring that issue up in the MPI debate, I do want to discuss it. I saw the best summary of it, I think, the other day. This is not a girl or a woman thing; this is a boy and a man thing. This is not about our daughters. This is not about our wives. This is not about our grandmothers. This is about our sons, our mates, our fathers and our grandfathers. I think the Prime Minister articulated that very emotionally and in a very heartfelt way the other day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Deputy Speaker O'Brien, I know that in a previous life you were a policeman. I'm sure in that role you would have been called to many domestic violence situations and many other situations that would have been quite horrific for you and, obviously, for the victims involved in that. I think what has happened in this country over the past five or six weeks has been a really important and a really necessary public discussion for us to have, because we need to get better. We need to get better not just in this building and within these workplaces; we need to get better in every workplace and in every household across this country. I think that's an important discussion. Obviously as a government here within this workplace and with other Commonwealth offices it will get better. There will be independent processes that can happen when allegations are made. But this is a very important discussion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have the great pleasure and great privilege to be the father of two daughters and a son. They all have, I think, the utmost potential to be anyone and anything they want to be, especially my daughters. I've always reinforced that to them. My youngest daughter did say that she sometimes does not feel safe socially. It is not okay when she's in certain places that that is the situation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to go on as well to talk about, besides this very important public conversation we've had over the last five or six weeks in this country, the fact that over the last 12 months the country has had a conversation about the pandemic and people's job security. That's been the most important thing they've wanted us to listen to them on. I think in this place it's really important that the institution of this chamber, the institution of the opposition and the institution of the press hold the government to account. I applaud the opposition when they hold us to account, when they point out failings or where they think we should do better things. But I'll tell you what: I think sometimes the opposition have to find a happy place. There are some really good things that have happened in this country and in this chamber that we have done on both the pandemic front and the economic front. But you wouldn't know that from the other side at all. They can never find a happy place. They can never say, 'We're doing okay here, but we want you to look there.' It's always an unhappy place with them. I think that's not necessarily healthy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What have we been listening to? What we were listening to 12 months ago was the Australian public. Our public health officials, nurses and doctors were saying: 'You've got to flatten the curve. We are going to be in a bad place if you don't flatten the curve of this pandemic.' So what did we do? Through the goodwill of the Australian people, through good hand hygiene, social distancing, we did better than flatten the curve. You can't eliminate a virus, but we've probably done better than any other country in the world in eliminating this one. We listened, we acted and, with the help of the Australian people, we did very well. We are now up to the vaccine rollout, which is an important part of this process as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not everyone votes for me in my electorate; that probably doesn't surprise anybody! Many people I know are good people who vote for the Labor Party and the Greens and they have congratulated us as a government. They have said: 'You have done a good job. You did a good job on the health front. You have done a good job on the economy.' They're grateful for that. That is important to acknowledge. Deloitte, a few months ago, said there is no better place in the world to be right now, if you look at both the health statistics and economic statistics, than Australia. A lot of that is on the goodwill of the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where are we up to with the pandemic? Again, it is not eliminated. You can't eliminate a virus, as we can see in any country. New Zealand has done very well, but every now and then there will be an outbreakâthings happen. But with the vaccine rollout, over 300,000 doses have been administered so far. Phase 1a was for those frontline workers, those who work in quarantine centres, or health officials who are exposed to people who have the virus or who will potentially be exposed to the virus and the elderly people in aged-care facilities who are vulnerable. Obviously, the older you are, if you get this virus, the more dangerous it is for you. We have rolled out phase 1a. Over 300,000 people have had that initial vaccine and now even the second dose of that is starting to roll out as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just this week we have stepped into 1b, which is for people over 70 and other frontline health staff. There will be hiccups. We said at the start of this that you can't easily roll out a double vaccine dose for the number of Australians we have with the logistics that are involved with the vaccine being deep frozen. I know the minister sitting next to me has been involved in this for regional Australia, and I thank him for his great care and diligence in this part of the rollout. There will be hiccups along the way, but so far so good. We are all about making sure Australians are safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians wanted us to listen. They were really worried. In fact, I would say, probably more Australians were telling me they were worried about their job than they were about the virus at certain times during this pandemic. We are aware that eight out of 10 jobs are in the private sector and we have done many things to make sure we protect people's business confidence and consumer confidence, to make sure they feel as though they have job security and faith in the future. In fact, business confidence and consumer confidence are up. Just in the last few weeks, Ray Morgan put out their business confidence survey. It was 16.2 points higher than a year ago in February 2020. It was at a multiyear high. Business confidence is higher than it was pre-pandemic. Consumer confidence is the same. Westpac Melbourne Institute was up to 111 in March. Again, it is higher than where it was pre-pandemic. A lot of this is on the back of the fact that we have managed the pandemic so well. Economically, we haven't been hit as hard as many other countries. We have all seen the news reports on countries in Europe, North America, just about every other continent that has been hit very hard on the health front and, therefore, damaged economically.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been great news on the jobs front. Just a week or so ago, we saw the unemployment rate fall from 6.3 per cent to 5.8 per cent. This outperformed everyone's projectionsâthe RBA, any economist. Any professional economist who gets paid for a living trying to predict this stuff got it wrong. We are bouncing out of this quicker than what they would have thought. We on this side are being flexible with this too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other side have made a lot about JobKeeper more recently. JobKeeper was always temporary. When we initiated it last March/April we designed it to run off in September. Last September, it was obvious that was too early. The economy was vulnerable. There were a lot of people who still couldn't open up and get their businesses back to where they wanted to be, so we extended it. We extended it again until the end of March. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a vacuum. While JobKeeper is rolling off, there are lots of other things out there, like the apprenticeship scheme and the JobMaker Hiring Credit scheme. We're going to adjust that because we want that to do better than it is. But there are still a lot of other incentives out there for people to employ. The biggest issueâand, anecdotally, it's been in my region now for probably six months or soâthat small businesses have in my community is they can't get enough staff. So we feel that the economy now has the capability to deal with this. We'll see how that goes, and, if we need to be more flexible or adjust what we're doing, we will. Again, the jobs figures last week surprised everyone and were extremely important. This hasn't happened by mistake. This has happened because the budget we did last year and the stimulus packages we initiated earlier in the year have all been about peoples' jobs and job security and making sure our economy got through this.</span>

                  <a href="83M" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PLIBERSEK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:35</span>):  I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Corio, for letting me push in ahead of him. We are facing a moment in history in Australia. We saw 110,000 women march and we saw 135,000 women sign a petition demanding change in this country. The question is: are we up to it as a nation? Do we have a government that is up to it? Do we have a Prime Minister who is up to it? This moment in our history could be the time when we change fundamentally to be a country where women feel safe on our streets, in our homes, in our workplaces. We could change now to be a country where women feel valued for their intellect, for their capacity, for their hard work, not their thigh gap. We could change now to be a country where every womanâand every man tooâhas the opportunity of living freely, of living free of gender stereotypes that are toxic not just for women, but also for men. We want every Australian to have the opportunity of living the life that they wish, free from these constraints. We could do that now as a nation. The question is: are we up to it? Are we up to it as a parliament to show the leadership that is necessary to win that change? Will those women marching, those women signing petitions lead to permanent change, or will it be a temporary inconvenience to be managed away like every other political problem that this government faces? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thought, when I saw the Prime Minister's press conference earlier this week, that he started so well. He actually sounded like he'd finally got it. He was repeating back to us, as we were listening, the things that he'd heard from womenâI don't know; maybe women in his family, in his office, in his social networksâand the frustrations that so many women feel. Then, 10 minutes into the press conference, because he got a question from a journalist, he just lost it again and made us think: was it all an act? Were the tears all an act? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The tragedy for Australian women today is, if we started crying about the women we know who have been raped and murdered and sexually assaulted and sexually harassed, if we started crying for the women that we know that this has happened to, we would never stop. We would never stop. I remember the names of Anita Cobby and Janine Balding, the women who were abducted and raped and tortured and murdered when I was growing up. I remember their names. They have always stayed with me. I remember Eurydice Dixon and I remember Hannah Clarke. I remember all these women. We all do. It takes more than tears. It takes legislative change. It takes cultural change. It takes working with our young people from their earliest days. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is sexual violence one of the few categories of violent crime that's actually increasing in our community? Despite everything we know, despite the truth that brave women like Grace Tame and Brittany Higgins and Chanel Contos and Saxon Mullins are getting up and telling in their own words, sexual violence is one of the violent crime categories that's increasing. It's increasing particularly amongst young people. We have failed as a parliament and as a community when we see increasing rates of sexual assault. We know that the system is completely stacked against victims of sexual assault in this country. We know that about one in 10 report and we know that, of that one in 10 that do report, about two per cent see a guilty conviction. That is a broken legal system. It's a broken society that allows it to happen in the first place. It is a broken legal system that prevents victims of these violent crimes achieving justice. As a parliament, as a society, as parents, we need to do better.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:40</span>):  It seems that the place of discussion has just shifted from the government and where the Leader of the Opposition was to a different subject altogether. I will just identify with the parts of the member for Sydney's address that we would all identify with. It's why I have put forward a couple of positive proposals to the Prime Minister for the executive to consider.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were a number of other things said today which were rather important. One was: you couldn't be in a better place today than in this nation. You couldn't be in a better place for your health and wellbeing, for your family's health and wellbeing and for your business's health and wellbeing, even though in the next few weeks we are going to face some diabolical times for small businessâanybody who thinks that's not going to happen is just fooling themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want to know what's important, it's that this government, on the COVID response, was on your side. This government, in response to health issues that have arisen, was on your sideâwas on the peoples' side. This government, as noted by the health minister today in his response to one family and that particular illness, was on your side. If you want to talk about how we responded to small businesses in trouble right across the nationâevery one of themâthis government was on your side. If you want to talk about flood response: we have learned the lessons and this government is on your side. If you want to remember the drought response for rural Australia: this government was on your side. Every time, this government was thinking about the people of Australia first, because that's our role. That's our role: putting the people first.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was disappointed with the Leader of the Opposition. He came in and talked about all the issues that affect us here in the parliamentary bubble. This is not a Canberra bubble. This is a parliamentary bubble. I am pretty sure that the people of Canberra are not really impressed every time a politician gets up in this place and talks about the Canberra bubble. That might mean something in rural and regional Australia and perhaps in other capital cities but this is a parliamentary bubble. It's the disgust of what has happened in this place, which was revealed in the last weekâand there will probably be more. Is there more hanging around out there for us, every one of us, all to be belted with? Is every one of us standing in slime in this place, in this green roomâno pun intended? There was a tiny bit of hilarity today because Minister Paul Fletcher, the Minister for Communications, Urban Infrastructure, Cities and the Arts, talked about some money going into arts and entertainment, and what happened? The whole room grabbed for that moment when we could think about something great for a minute, instead of where we have been sloshing around. There's more money to go to there. I tell the arts industry: we're on your side. I tell the entertainment industry: this government is on your side. But, more importantly, people like travel agents: we're on your side. People like travel agents have just had some more money, and we will concentrate and we will try for them and, if we can do more, we will. But we're on their side.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MARLES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corio</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:46</span>):  At this time, in this moment, Australia needs a government that will take responsibility and a government that will lead. But what the beginning of the parliamentary year has revealed is that, instead, we have an eight-year-old, tired, deflated, worn-out, broken wheel. This government is literally limping along a road while other countries are taking off into a post-COVID future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the remarkable Grace Tame was named Australian of the Year earlier this year and inspired Brittany Higgins's extraordinary expression of courage in telling her story, it unleashed and unfolded a conversation in this country unlike any that I've experienced in my lifetime. It is one which asks us to think about the gender relations of our society, one which asks us to reaffirm the status of women in Australiaâfor women to be believed, and for women to have the right to be respected and be safe at home and at work. That conversation was always going to have the Prime Minister as being central to it. He is the most senior person in the country, yet it's as if he didn't hear a word of it because, whenever the Prime Minister has opened his mouth, he has completely missed the mark.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Brittany Higgins made her allegations, the Prime Minister sought to defend the position that an alleged rape that took place just metres from his office two years ago was not made known to his office until February of this year. That just can't be right. That is not true, because everybody in this building, on both sides of the parliament, knows that there is a human resources function which exists in the Prime Minister's office on behalf of all ministerial staff. That's exactly why Peta Credlin and Malcolm Turnbull, two people who know a little bit about how prime ministers' offices work, have said that that claim beggars belief. But, when the Prime Minister made that claim, what he really said to the country was that, rather than dealing with the issue, he was going to seek to politically manage the issue. When serious allegations were made in respect of the Attorney-General, the obvious step to take was to put in place an independent inquiry to remove the shadow hanging over the first law officer of the nation and also, given the tragedy of the circumstances, to allow the serious allegations that had been made to be properly explored. But this government was never going to allow that kind of scrutiny to apply to this Prime Minister and this government. Then we saw the defence minister respond to Brittany Higgins and her allegations by making a terrible character attack.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where that leaves us on this day is with two ministers hanging by a thread, a reshuffle which is about to occur and thousands of public servants in important departments like Attorney-General's and Defence without the foggiest idea of what this government is actually on about. And all of this is occurring while there are a million people on JobKeeper and when, three days from now, that benefit is going to be removed. Treasury is saying that up to 150,000 people are going to lose their jobs in three days time, and all that those people hear from this government is boasting and arrogance. What's in its place is the much-touted wage subsidy program, JobMaker, which the government said would support 450,000 jobs. Well, on this day it's 609. Then there are the vaccinations, which the government rightly says are the key to getting us past this crisis, to having a sustained and permanent recovery. They said there would be four million Australians vaccinated in this month. We have six days to go and, with six days to go, this government is 3.7 million shy of its four million target. If this government has one job this year it is to vaccinate Australia. Right now, this government is horribly behind in the single most important job that it has this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government which is completely at sea. You might say it's lost its way but the truth is it never had a way at the start. What we need to see is a Prime Minister who sits in this chair and speaks for the Australian people rather than wallowing in the politics of the day. We need a Prime Minister who sits in this chair and is a statesman rather than just a political hack.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:51</span>):  It is a pleasure to rise and speak on this matter of public importance because it gives me the opportunity to say how proud I am to be part of a government that is representing all Australians and is there to give opportunity for all Australians because that's what this side of the House is about. Particularly as we come out of the COVID-19 recession, we want to create more jobs and more opportunity for Australian families and that's something that I care deeply about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With JobKeeper coming to an end, it is worth reflecting on this remarkable program. Who would have thought just 12 months ago that we would be here with the opportunity to roll out a vaccine, with the JobKeeper program coming to an end after getting to the point where there are more jobs now than there was at the beginning of the pandemicâabsolutely extraordinary! There are plenty of naysayers on that side of the chamber, on the Labor side, who didn't think that JobKeeper would work. They're now calling for it to be extended. But at the time it was this government that backed in Australians with a remarkable package, a record package of support, that was specifically targeted to keep Australians connected to their workplaces, to keep Australians in jobs.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr SIMMONDS:</span>
                  </a>  I hear the interjections from those on the other side of the chamber. They like to claim credit but it simply wasn't true. They had a bob each way, as they do in so many things when it comes to this place. They pretend to support it and then they go outside and undermine it. We see exactly what the Labor members are doing when they speak out of both sides of their mouths when it comes to the vaccine rollout. They say it is so important and they back the government in making sure every Australian is vaccinated, and then they come in this place or they get on Sky News and seek to undermine the rollout and seek to sow the seeds of doubt in the minds of Australians. It is such a disappointment. I do not understand why on this, of all issues, the vaccination against COVID-19 for the Australian population, the Labor MPs can't be firmly on team Australia. Even on that very simple topic, you would think it would be straightforward to support the government to rollout the COVID-19 vaccine. But not even then can the Labor MPs bring themselves to not politicise such an important issue. It is a great shame. It says everything you need to know about how the Labor MPs have responded to this COVID-19 crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What a contrast those opposite are compared to this government, which has firmly backed all Australians, which acted decisively and quickly. It got behind Australians in a way that has created more jobs now than at the start of the pandemic and is now giving all those families opportunities. It is not just creating jobs. We know that business confidence is at its highest levels in 11 years despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Unemployment is down to 5.8 per cent. The comeback is well and truly on, and it just goes to show that you would rather be living in Australia now than anywhere else in the world. We can be incredibly proud as Australians. All Australians can be proud of what they have achieved during this pandemic because it is something that virtually nowhere else in the world has been able to achieve. It is a record of significance that they should be proud of and that they have achieved together by working together and by taking advantage of the significant support programs that this government has implemented.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not just the COVID-19 pandemic where this government is backing Australians in. We've guaranteed funding and committed to invest $315 billion in schools over the next decade. To put that into context: it will increase the average funding per student by 60 per cent over the decade. More generally: in health, we now preside over a far more successful bulk-billing scheme. The bulk-billing rate was over 87 per cent in 2019-20, up from 82 per cent in 2012-13, which was Labor's last year in government, and nearly 143 million free GP services were delivered last year, 39 million more than in Labor's last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're presiding over record spending on infrastructure, particularly on urban infrastructure, which is creating jobs and helping to reduce congestion so that people can get home to their families sooner and safer. There's $110 billion in the pipeline over 10 years to invest in infrastructure, including for major highways, busting open congestion, and to make public transport better so that we can back in all Australians and create jobs and opportunities for families. We are firmly on 'team Australia' and we are firmly on the side of ordinary Australians, unlike the Labor MPs opposite.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:56</span>):  When this government cuts JobKeeper this weekend it will mark its final transition from 'all in this together' to 'you're all on your own'. Those opposite see a moment in time when government was part of ensuring that we looked out for each other and looked after each other, and they see it as some kind of aberrationâsome kind of brief interlude and some kind of historical oddityâto be quickly forgotten. To those opposite, 'all in this together' was only ever a political platitude plucked from a poll, or from the pages of a focus group report, not the defining principle behind a country and a people who have done so much to stick by each other in the most difficult recent times. The problem is that this government is psychologically and temperamentally incapable of understanding the struggle of 1.1 million Australians who are still on JobKeeper, or the two million Australians who either can't find a job or can't find enough hours to support their loved ones. It has absolutely no idea what it's like for the 100,000 to 150,000 Australians who the Treasury has told the government it expects will lose their jobs when the Prime Minister and the Treasurer cut JobKeeper this weekend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know from reports out of the coalition party room that the Treasurer sees hundreds of thousands of Australians and their fears and anxieties about job losses as a political challenge to be managedâsomething to try to spin and grin away in this tsunami of self-congratulation that the government engages in every day in this place. This is a government which is long on self-regard and short on empathy; long on announcement and short on delivery. Each day when we ask the Treasurer about the Australians who are still doing it tough, we get a lecture about the Australians who have, in his words, 'graduated' from JobKeeper.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we're not asking the Treasurer about the unemployment rate. We're not asking him about numbers on a page and we're not asking him about how many Australians are no longer on JobKeeper. We're asking him to understand that more than a million people are still on JobKeeper and when it's cut this has consequences for their ability to provide for their families. We're asking him to understand that every dollar wasted on companies that don't need JobKeeper means a dollar that can't go to the small businesses and workers who still need it. We're asking him to understand that this recession is not yet over for every single Australian.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But they don't understand the human consequences of cutting support for a million Australians and all those businesses which employ them, or the anxiety that comes from not knowing whether people's jobs will hit the fence. If announcements, press conferences and photo opportunities were jobs then we'd be fine. Instead, we have this weapons-grade incompetence which is threatening our recovery from recession. Only 609 jobs have been delivered out of the 450,000 that the Treasurer promised in his hiring credits program. There was a $60 billion error in the JobKeeper program and all this money was sprayed around to the Gerry Harveys of this world, who don't need it. We have a vaccination promise that is at least 90 per cent short of its target this month. One of the justifications for cutting JobKeeper was four million vaccinations that won't happen this month. They can't even get flood mitigation money out the doorâtwo years after it was announced. This is a pattern of behaviour: the big announcement, the self-congratulation and the diabolical policy failure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, the economy's recovering; yes, we want jobs created; and, when they are, we say so. But the economy is hostage to a lot of uncertainty, and not just any recovery is befitting the sacrifices that Australians have made for each other. What kind of recovery matters to the small businesses, workers, families and communities of this country? We need better than more of the same wage stagnation that we had before. We need more than a recovery where the weakest are singled out and sacrificed, and the strongest are subsidised. We owe Australians more, and better, than this. We owe them an economy, a country, that is stronger after COVID than it was beforeâa future made in Australia, where we teach and train our people to keep up with technological change; cleaner and cheaper energy; cheaper and more accessible child care; and decent aged care for more of our older people. We owe them a recovery that is worthy of Australians and the sacrifices they have made in this recession and in its aftermath.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="282982" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr MARTIN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:01</span>):  Not a day goes by when I do not field calls and emails from my constituents on a whole range of issues. From immigration to Centrelink, from foreign affairs to the state of our local parks and roads, as a member of parliament I hear it all. Of course, the past year has been dominated by COVID-19. Tragically, lives have been lost and livelihoods have been ruined across the world. In Australia it has been far from easy. But, fortunately, this government's strong management of the virus has limited the human toll compared to other developed nations around the world. The Morrison government is spending over $21 billion on COVID-19 specific health measures and securing over 150 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine. This is in addition to investing in new sovereign vaccine manufacturing capability at CSL in Melbourne. A record $131.4 billion in public hospital funding has been guaranteed through a new five-year deal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we know that the pandemic has been not only a major health crisis but an economic crisis too. I have heard the calls and read the emails for help from individuals and businesses affected by COVID. When they asked, the Morrison government responded. When my constituents said they would need targeted income support, the Morrison government committed unprecedented support to save lives, cushion the blow and help Australians remain in jobs. JobKeeper supported over one million businesses and over 3.8 million jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But that's not all. The cashflow boost has already provided $35 billion in payments helping over 800,000 small and medium-sized businesses to stay afloat. The Morrison government is also acting in the interests of Australian apprentices and trainees by providing a 50 per cent wage subsidy supporting around 180,000 apprentices and trainees. This is in addition to 320,000 JobTrainer places for school leavers and jobseekers to upskill. But that's not all. Australians who want to get ahead and get a home are also being supported through the HomeBuilder program. This is supporting the residential construction industry, creating jobs and stimulating the economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some Australians who have needed an additional hand-up during the difficult times, and this government has listened to them. The coronavirus supplement provided extra support for those on JobKeeper. While that supplement has now tapered off, as it was always going to, the Morrison government has provided a permanent increase to the rate of JobSeeker. This is the most substantial increase since the 1980s. Without JobKeeper and other measures to support our economy, the Treasury estimates that the unemployment rate would have been five percentage points higher. We must remember that the government was able to act in the interests of Australians thanks to its strong economic management before the pandemic. In the 2018-19 budget period, the Morrison government brought the budget back to balance for the first time in 11 years and maintained our AAA credit rating.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Phil Gilbert Motor Group employs 180 people across the inner west of Sydney, and it's in my electorate, in Croydon. In September of last year they graduated off JobKeeper, because the business picked up again, and have since employed 12 new apprentices, supported by the government's program. Edwina Gilbert recently hosted Minister Cash, the Prime Minister and I and showed us around one of her service centres. It was great to see firsthand how the Morrison government is listening and acting in the interests of all Australians,</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government is also investing in creating more STEM opportunities for Australian women. Up to 600 Australian women will be encouraged to study science, technology, engineering and maths while they are working as part of the expansion of the Morrison government's Women in Stem Cadetship and Advanced Apprenticeship Program. The program provides grants to higher education providers to deliver a range of qualifications that employees can take on part time alongside their studies. The Australian people speak. Members of parliament listen. And the Morrison government acts.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWK" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BUTLER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  For weeks we've seen a government paralysed by a scandal and by their incompetence. We've seen a Prime Minister completely incapable of listening toâlet alone understanding, let alone responding in a meaningful wayâthe loud and clear calls from the Australian community, particularly Australian women, for real and meaningful changes to the way in which women are treated in this country by men, most notably because of the cases that have been published in the media, how women are treated by men in this building but, more broadly, how they're treated in Australian workplaces across the country and in the broader community. It's clear that the Prime Minister just doesn't get it. In and of itself, that is bad enough. But in the meantime this tired, eight-year-old governmentâwhose frontbench, frankly, redefines the term 'mediocrity'âis completely incapable, is paralysed, in addressing some profound challenges that are facing this country. My colleagues have talked about emergency management. They've talked about jobs and the cliff facing a million people who are facing the end of JobKeeper this weekend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is no challenge more important right now than the successful rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine. We've supported the government's vaccine rollout strategy. We've supported the longer time that the TGA took to approve the COVID vaccines than was taken in some of the Northern Hemisphere countries that are facing emergencies that, thankfully, we are not. We've been united in that support for the role of the TGAâin contrast, frankly, to those opposite, who continue to have breakouts, including, most recently, a breakout from a member of the Senate leadership team in the coalition about whether or not the TGA is the final word on these issues. We support the strategy. But we will say, as so many are around the country, that this rollout is too slow, and the government is too complacent about this. The rollout, and its speed and effectiveness, is directly related to the strength of our economic recovery. That's why the Chamber of Commerce and Industry has said, in relation to the slowness of the rollout, that it's 'depressing'. AiG said, 'The risk for Australia is that we get left behind as our competitors steal a march on us because the rest of the world is going so much more quickly than Australia.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians remember that the Prime Minister very boldly committed to four million vaccinations by the end of this monthâby the end of March. He then said, 'Oh, it might be early April.' Then he said, 'Oh, it might be late April.' Then he completely dropped the four million commitment altogether; he doesn't talk about that anymore. He put in place another commitment, of six million vaccinations by 10 May and 11 million vaccinations by the end of May. I think we all pray that at least he does better on that than he's done on his March commitment. In the past few weeks he again said, 'We will get this done by October; the country will be fully vaccinated by October.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So where are we today? Well, around the world we've seen almost half a billion vaccinations, as of todayâ486 million vaccinations. The US is up to 130 million vaccinations, going at three million per day. The UK is up at over 31 million vaccinations, going at 750,000 per day. Twice what we have managed in five weeks, they are doing every single day. Tomorrow, at the end of week 5 of the vaccine rollout strategy, we will be at about 400,000 vaccinations, 10 per cent of the commitment the Prime Minister made. The Prime Minister has blamed Italy. They shut down 250,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine that were supposed to come to Australia. He said it's Italy's fault and Europe's fault we haven't done better on the commitment of four million vaccinations. Everyone knows we've had 1.3 million doses in this country for days, and still we've only managed to roll out less than one-third of the doses that have been in this country for days. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The rollout of the booking system was utter chaos. The GPs listed on that were not told beforehand that they were going to be listed. Receptionists were completely inundated by patients who were desperate to get into a booking system. But GPs knew they were getting only 50 doses per week. They had no idea what they were getting in the out weeks. How are you supposed to have a booking schedule when you don't know how many doses you are going to get? The scale of this challenge is huge. The government is way behind schedule. The strength of our economic recovery depends upon the rollout. Instead of all hands to the wheel in making sure that this works, we've got a government distracted and paralysed by scandal and their incompetence.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAMILTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:11</span>):  Reading today's MPI I can't help but feel that the Labor Party have very short memories. Before I go there, I acknowledge there are so many issues across the Australian experience where there is much work to be done, but that is why I am hereâto work to improve this great nation of ours. That's why we're all here. It's with great humility that I approach my day's labours in the House. It's with great humility that I accept the charge of leading my community in this House. We all do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is a textbook case on how to recover from a global pandemic, how to keep people safe and how to create a safety net for those who are vulnerable. The theme of the last year has been that we are all in this together. But today the Labor Party have shown that they are not. They seek to condemn a government that's held tight the line between pandemic and chaos. They've forgotten the challenges Australia has faced. They've forgotten about keeping people safe. They've forgotten about how hard it can be to rebuild our community and to rebuild our economy. They have short memories.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's economic comeback is well underway. The global pandemic has been one of the greatest challenges this country has faced this century. The potential of this nation to face double-digit unemployment was real. That chaos was upon us. The wolf was at the door. Today we should be acknowledging the hard work of the Australian people in preventing that. We should be acknowledging the Australian government for listening to the Australian people and acting in the best interests of the people that we serve. There is much to do, but this government has shown its ability to work for the people of Australia and to be the government that they need in a time of crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we sit here today, out in the real world many sectors of our economy are already bouncing back. This is evidenced by Australia's economic growth of 3.1 per cent in the December quarter, which followed a 3.4 per cent rise in September. Our nation has turned the corner, and we should be very, very proud of our economic recovery. We should acknowledge the unprecedented turnaround as, for the first time in our nation's history, we have seen two consecutive quarters of economic growth of more than three per cent. That's a significant landmark in Australia's history. How good is it, too, that the evidence shows the real economy has recovered around 85 per cent of the fall since the start of the pandemic? Australians are returning to work because of our economic turnaround. This is a very, very good thing. Ninety-four per cent of the 1.3 million Australians who lost their jobs or who saw their working hours reduced to zero are now back at work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to place on the record the thanks from my community to the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Minister for Health and Aged Care and the whole Morrison government for their work over the past 12 months in keeping Australia safe. I extend that thanks to the premiers for working hard to keep their states safe too through working together under the new national cabinet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In our Toowoomba region the evidence of our recovery is being felt on the ground, with a real sense of confidence and optimism for our future. Last week I visited Homestyle Bake in Toowoomba, a locally owned and operated bakery which has flourished in our region for 32 years. The directors of Homestyle Bake are about to undertake a significant investment in their Harristown factory by upgrading their bread line. This investment will double their output and unlock new business opportunities for the futureâan investment they simply would not be making if they did not feel confident of our economic recovery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a recovery that's been carefully built through our COVID-19 economic support measures, like JobKeeper, which supported 4,700 businesses in my region through the turbulence of 2020. The evidence shows that local businesses are starting to employ again and starting to grow again. I turn again to the Finch Cafe, which is now opening a second store, only months into our recovery. This is fantastic news. Our Toowoomba region has seen 846 apprentices registered through the Morrison government's wage subsidy program. These are young people entering the workforce at a crucial time in their lives, making sure that they set themselves up for a career. This is fantastic news for our region, and this is evidence that local employers are feeling confident enough to expand their teams, to invest time in the young people of our region and grow the skills pipeline in our region for important future projects like Inland Rail. Many of these apprenticeships will be in the construction sector which is going gangbusters in the Toowoomba region off the back of our HomeBuilder scheme, which has done so much for our region and which has been so well received by Toowoomba's construction industry.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Archives and Other Legislation Amendment Bill supports the independent review into the workplaces of parliamentarians and their staff that is led by Australia's Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Ms Kate Jenkins. The government announced this review on 5 March 2021. Its aim is to ensure that all Commonwealth parliamentary workplaces are safe and respectful and that our national parliament reflects best practice in the prevention and handling of bullying, sexual harassment and sexual assault. The review must bring about cultural and practical change in our parliamentary workplace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is of paramount importance that parliamentarians and staff, both current and former, can freely participate and have their say. This bill will strengthen the confidentiality of information provided to or created by the independent review. It does this in two ways. Firstly, it will exclude a right of access under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 to all documents provided to or created by the independent review. Secondly, it will provide that these records not come into the open access period under the Archives Act 1983 until 99 years after the year the record comes into existence. These proposed amendments would not prevent the independent review from publishing such information as it considers appropriate. The amendments are intended to encourage individuals to come forward to the independent review and give information that is relevant to its terms of reference. This information could include accounts of a deeply personal and sensitive nature as well as allegations about the conduct of other people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill supports the objectives of the Sex Discrimination Commissioner's review. In particular, it will support the review in understanding the experiences and expectations of current and former parliamentarians and staff as well as other staff working within the Parliament of Australia. I thank members for their contribution to this debate and I look forward to hearing their contributions. I commend the bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWG" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DREYFUS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:22</span>):  On 5 March the government announced that it would appoint the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Kate Jenkins, to conduct an independent review into the workplaces of parliamentarians and their staff. There is a clear need for such a review, and it has Labor's full support. As set out in the terms of reference, the aim of the review is 'to ensure that all Commonwealth parliamentary workplaces are safe and respectful, and that our national parliament reflects best practice in the prevention and handling of bullying, sexual harassment and sexual assaults'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the review is to achieve its aim, it is absolutely critical that as many current and former staff as possible participate. Last week, a bipartisan group of current and former parliamentary staff members and their supporters wrote to the opposition leader and to the Prime Minister expressing their concern about the privacy and confidentiality of submissions made to the review. In particular, they expressed concern that, as the Human Rights Commission is subject to the Freedom of Information Act and the Archives Act, there is currently no guarantee that information submitted to the review will remain private and confidential. Many staff had already raised these concerns with members of the Labor caucus directly. I know that everyone in this place agrees that current and former staff must have confidence that their privacy will be protected if they participate in this review. The review needs to be a safe place for everyone participating in it. This bill is intended to provide that safety, first, by amending the Freedom of Information Act so that submissions to the independent review and any documents created by the review are exempt from the operation of the act, and, second, by amending the Archives Act so that review documents will not be accessible by any member of the public for 99 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge that a concern has been raised about the scope of these exemptions. In particular there is a concern that the exemption in the Freedom of Information Act could be exploited by government ministers and departments to deny victims and survivors of abuse or harassment access to materials relating to their own complaints. We understand that concern, and Labor has been engaging constructively with the government and members of the crossbench all week in a joint effort to address it, while also ensuring that anyone who wishes to participate in the review can have complete confidence that their privacy and their confidentiality will be protected. It was because of the constructive engagement by Labor, the government and members of the crossbench that the amendment that is going to be moved by the member for Warringah is now in a form that can and should be supported by everyone in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that the bill is going to be amended in the House today means that it cannot pass the parliament until May. While on one level that is regrettable, we note and take comfort in the welcome assurances that have been provided by the Australian Human Rights Commission about the protection of confidential information between now and the May sittings of the parliament. It is Labor's sincere hope that the passage of this bill will ensure that everyone who wishes to participate in the independent review will have the confidence to do so.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:27</span>):  I rise to support the Archives and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2021. These amendments will ensure that the review conducted by the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Kate Jenkins, is effective and not hampered by the legitimate privacy concerns that have been raised by staff and former staff, victims and survivors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wrote to the Prime Minister last Tuesday calling for this legislation. He wrote back to me at the time saying he was supportive of that and requesting that we put forward this legislation, pledging government support. As it is, some procedural changes have altered that but with the same outcome. It's an outcome that we've been after here. I'm very pleased that this legislation will be supported by government members, opposition members and crossbench members. That is a good thing indeed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our staff and members of parliament have made it plain from the outset that they welcome the Jenkins review. Indeed, Labor called for this review in a joint media release from myself, as Labor leader, and Tanya Plibersek, as the shadow minister for the status of women, on 16 February in response to the reported sexual assault of Brittany Higgins in the office of the then Minister for Defence Industry in 2019 and other issues. This review is an important opportunity to bring about the cultural change that is needed, to get the resources and protections needed, to transform the parliament into a safe workplace. This should be a safe workplace for everyone who works here. As a Labor parliamentarian, I say that Labor have a particular special duty to our staff, but I think every member of parliament has a duty to ensure their staff are properly protected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This review must listen to those who come forward. They should be able to come forward in the confidence that any statements or submissions they make will be confidential, and that they won't be put in a difficult position in a year's time or 10 years time or 20 years time or 30 years time. That is what this legislation is aimed at. The fact is every workplace in Australia should be safeâevery recreational venue, every home. We know, thanks to the courage of people like Brittany Higgins and the thousands of women and men who marched last week, that this workplace isn't the safe workplace it should be.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The aim of the Review is to ensure all Commonwealth Parliamentary workplaces are safe and respectful and that our national Parliament reflects best practice in the prevention and handling of bullying, sexual harassment and sexual assault.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why it is vital that as many current and former staff as possible are able to participate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been brave women who have chosen to tell their stories to drive change and I acknowledge that bravery. We have heard though from many staff directly and through their unions, or through voluntary supporters and advocates, that some do not feel safe to come forward unless they have these guarantees of confidentiality and privacy beyond those provided by the ordinary processes of the Human Rights Commission. Concerns have been raised by staff and former staff from all parties that as the Human Rights Commission is subject to the Freedom of Information Act and the Archives Act there is currently, without this legislation, no guarantee that information submitted to the review will remain private. That's why this legislation is so important and that's why I wrote to the Prime Minister last Tuesday. More recently, a bipartisan group of current and former federal parliamentary staff members and their supporters wrote to the Prime Minister and to myself expressing those same concerns. The bill is the product of negotiations across this parliament and it delivers the protection that staff deserve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I say, in terms of outcomes, one of the things I've said publicly, and I say it here as well, is that where there have been issues we have successfully set up independent organisations, such as IPEA to look at the entitlements for members of parliament and their offices, and that has been a success. We've established the Parliamentary Budget Office to bring integrity to commitments that are given during election campaigns.<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>It seems to me that a model of an independent body, whereby people could safely go and make confidential submissions, a place where complaints could be made and dealt with in a confidential way, at arm's length from the current systemâthat clearly is compromised, because the MOP(S) Act means that often there are relationships related to the political process between members of parliament, ministers and their staff. That's just a fact. Therefore, I really hope, and I have confidence, that in examining these matters Kate Jenkins will come up with proposals that do give more confidence and in future will ensure that people can have somewhere to go that is separate from the sorts of debates that we've had in recent days about, for example, what staff in the Prime Minister's office or other offices, as well as MPs, know. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to pay tribute to our caucus chair, who's here, the member for Newcastle; the shadow minister for women, the member for Sydney; and others, particularly the women in our caucus, who have shown incredible leadership and have come forward and worked so hard on developing a framework for the Labor Party of an updated code of conduct, a sexual harassment policy, a bullying policy and a complaints process. That was unanimously adopted by the ALP national executive on 26 February. That process also could be looked at in terms of being a model. We'll continue to work on it. You never get these things right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Essentially a lot of these issues arise from the power imbalance in society related to the fact that patriarchy exists in our society. We want to ensure that there's full equality. At the moment there's not. The party caucus I joined in 1996 was far less reflective of Australian society than the current one is. I look around at the people. Not only is gender important but religious background, ethnicity and First Nations people being represented in far greater numbers are as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We strongly support this bill. We'll support the amendment that will be moved. The Jenkins review offers a chance for generational cultural change. Let's not waste it.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:36</span>):  I will make a few brief remarks because the Archives and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2021 has been addressed at length in the Senate. This bill relates to the current inquiry by the Sex Discrimination Commissioner into the culture and the procedures that are in place in Parliament House to ensure that everyone has a safe workplace. That review is something the Greens welcome and have, in fact, been calling for for months. We're very pleased that over recent times others have added their voices to that call and now, finally, the Prime Minister has done it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation came about because a number of people expressed concerns and wanted to make sure that any submissions they made to that review remained confidential. That was a concern that the Greens listened to and so, some time ago, our leader in the Senate, Senator Larissa Watersâshe is also our spokesperson for womenâraised this with the government and in other forums to make sure that that concern was addressed. In that respect the legislation does something importantâit gives women in particular the confidence to come forward to this review. We certainly encourage them to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some additional concerns were raised about whether the drafting allows the government to do other thingsânot so much protect the privacy of the people who wanted to put information to the review but provide a shield for the government to hide other documents. In that respect concerns were raised, and we listened to those as well. I commend the member for Warringah for the amendment she will move, which the Greens will support here. Again, I want to place on record acknowledgement of the significant work done by Senator Larissa Waters, who has also been involved in discussions with the member for Warringah, the government and the opposition about this amendment.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because we're reaching the end of the day on the last sitting day and it's important that this bill passes, I'll leave my comments there other than to say that this review is something that the Greens have been calling for for months and months. I'm very pleased it's happening. We urge everyone to participate in it. This parliament deserves to be a safe workplace, and one of the ways that we can make that happen is by having full participation in this review and implementing the recommendations that come out of itâhopefully, not after waiting a year but quickly. That's something the Greens will be committed to.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:39</span>):  I have a few brief points on the Archives and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2021. I want to reflect on the genesis of this important bill and the independent inquiry it supports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the past month unfolded, the crossbench and opposition called on the government to launch this particular inquiry. Of course, there are multiple inquiries on the books right now, including the unsatisfactory Gaetjens review, which is being held at arm's length from the PMO and has been paused indefinitely. It was obvious to me and to many others in this House from the outset that inquiries of this nature must be fully independent and conducted by someone with appropriate expertise. Kate Jenkins is that person, and I really welcome this review. Of course, it doesn't take a review to know the basics and the reasons for why we need this review. We certainly don't need to wait for this review; it is complete before we act and legislateâsomething that I was concerned to hear the Prime Minister suggest in question time yesterday.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What do we know already? We know that there's a toxic culture here in parliament. We know that there is no safe and independent place for MPs and their staff to go to with serious complaints in this place. We know that the government sat on Kate Jenkins' previous <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@work</span> report recommendations for over a year and we know that the government could have passed a bill I introduced last October to establish an independent parliamentary standards commissioner and a code of conduct. We know that the government could have passed the bill that the member for Warringah introduced last week to amend the sex discrimination laws so that they apply to all of us in this chamber. No other workplace in this country would take so long to act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this bill is about ensuring that victims can come safely to this inquiry. Their privacy must be protected at all costs and I think we all agree on that. I want to thank the member for Warringah for her tireless work this week to ensure that this bill has the appropriate confidentiality safeguards. Her amendments are really important, I support them and I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CLAYDON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:42</span>):  It gives me great pleasure to rise this evening to speak on the Archives and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2021. It's been an extraordinarily difficult few weeks in this House. I think that all of us here would share that view, and that the sooner the independent review of workplaces of parliamentarians and their staff gets underway the better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But in all the conversations I've had with staff members in this buildingâLabor staff, mostly, given that I'm a Labor memberâit was made abundantly clear from day one, even before this Jenkins review was announced, that we needed an independent and at-arm's-length review process and that nothing less would suffice. More importantly, staff had to be 100 per cent confident in the process of making a submission to the review that their privacy would be protected. They made very clear to me in all of the consultations I've had over many months nowâand I was talking about these issues well before the review was announcedâthat they had zero trust in current reporting systems in this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It makes me incredibly sad that that's the case, that there's such a lack of confidence in the current systems and such a feeling of lack of protection. So it's absolutely vital that the Jenkins review provides assurances to staff that they will have their privacy protected. That meant not being subject to freedom of information laws, as would ordinarily be the case at the Australian Human Rights Commission. It also meant amendments to the Archives Act to provide the kinds of protections that we've seen in royal commissionsâcertainly in royal commissions dealing with sensitive issues. This is now a gold standard, the 99-year suppression in the Archives Act. I welcome very much those changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were concerns raised. It is a bizarre scenario that we would have to ask a government not to operate in bad faith, but that is exactly what people were demandingâsome assurances that there wouldn't be efforts made, for those people with existing complaints that predated this announcement of the review, by the government being sneaky and tricky and trying to bury what would have been otherwise discoverable documents and information in the process. I am not actually suggesting that that would have been on the government's cards but, clearly, even having just that window of doubt in peoples' minds was enough to jeopardise this important independent review process. So being able to arrive at a place where we can provide that assurance to people that there will not be capacity to be dumping in documents, important evidence and information that would suddenly now be deemed non-discoverable for those people with existing complaints who understandably wish to pursue justice and seek redress. They should have absolutely every opportunity to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is critical that women in this place feel safe about coming to work. The Australian parliament, I have said this on many occasions now, must be a model employer. But it's not just Labor staff, Liberal staff, crossbench staff. We need to be providing safe workplaces for the cleaners who come into this building, for the men and women from nongovernment organisations who come to lobby for a better, fairer deal out of this place, all the contractors. Everybody should be guaranteed safety in this place. There are 5,000 people who work in this building and every one of them deserve to come to work every day feeling safe. If this review helps us get to that pathâI agree with earlier commentsâwe should not be waiting 12 months for this review to be concluded in order to make changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the government need only pick up Ms Jenkins' earlier review, Respect@Work, and enact those 55 recommendations. We might be in a very different position today in 2021 had we insisted that the government enact those recommendations. I look forward to a great sense of urgency from this government in making sure that every one of those recommendations is enacted in full, adequately resourced and properly supported to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say thank you to the shadow Attorney-General, Mark Dreyfus, for his extraordinary and ongoing commitment to ensuring that this process was going to be survivor focused, that it would be a practice that would be trauma informed. He had the full support of the member for Sydney, the shadow minister for women, and Senator Katy Gallagher and Senator Don Farrell from the other place, who were part of an important negotiating team with the government to ensure that our staff are afforded every protection they deserve and so rightfully have fought very hard to ensure that they are received.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an important process and it is worth this parliament backing in. Indeed, the only regret is it will have to wait for May to get passed. But I understand we have every assurance from government and all members of this party that these provisions, these protections, these tight assurances, will be applied retrospectively to 5 March, when the government announced the appointment of the Sex Discrimination Commissioner Kate Jenkins for this review. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I want to say to all members of staff, to all people who interact with this building as a workplace and indeed our other Commonwealth and electorate offices beyond, that I encourage you to participate in this review. This review is an important historical moment, I believe, but it requires that people are able to make forthright contributions, free of any suggestion that there would be any kind of punishment or retribution or that they would have their names leaked in any way, shape or form. I think these amendments go to addressing those concerns, and that's why I'm very pleased to speak tonight in support of them and commend the bill to the House. Thank you very much.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">(2DB) A Minister and an agency other than the Australian Human Rights Commission are not exempt under subsection (2DA)(a) from the operation of this Act in relation to documents created for purposes other than the Independent Review to which a right of access otherwise exists or existed under the Act.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The review is a very, very important step to build an understanding of the culture of the parliamentary workplaces, with the aim of building a safe and respectful workplace in which all staff have access to clear and effective mechanisms to prevent and address bullying, sexual harassment and sexual assault. The review will consider recommendations to ensure that the people who work in parliamentary workplaces are treated with dignity and respect and have access to clear and effective mechanisms to prevent and address bullying, sexual harassment and sexual assault. It is so important to give assurance of confidentiality of information given to the independent review into the workplaces of parliamentarians and their staff conducted by the Sex Discrimination Commissioner by making amendments to the Freedom of Information Act and the Archives Act, which this bill does.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's an incredibly significant inquiry, and it is vital that we get these protections right in order to ensure the confidence of witnesses. That is why this amendment is proposed now. Many potential witnesses in the inquiry have contacted me personally highlighting their concerns. They've also been contacting other women on the crossbench, and I thank those women for their courage and determination to be heard. I thank my colleagues for their engagement with these women and their cooperation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendment moved is to reflect the concerns identified in relation to the bill as it passed the other place. The women who contacted me are from a range of backgrounds, but all ultimately are aware of the culture of this place. They are acutely politically aware and highly sensitive to the potential for deceit as a result of past experience. These women were concerned that, unamended, the bill had a potential overreach and would prevent them from accessing historical documents that they would otherwise be entitled to under existing freedom of information legislation. The amendment that I have moved today clarifies that the exemption from freedom of information requests extends only to documents for the purpose of independent review. The original documents contained within the departments and ministerial offices are not exempt from freedom of information. Whilst this amendment means that this bill will be passed when it returns to the Senate in May, I welcome the reassurance from Kate Jenkins, the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, and her confirmation that this will not delay or impact the progress of the independent review. This is very important in order for all potential participants to have confidence and to be reassured.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you to all my crossbench colleagues and the opposition for coming together to support this bill and this important amendment. Thank you to the government for listening to the concerns raised, especially to Minister Birmingham, and for our discussions and collaborative approach to this amendment. Finally, thank you to the many individuals who have raised this issue and who have contacted me directly to highlight their concerns and the importance of getting this right. We must have a situation of an inquiry where all submissions will be held in the utmost confidence, where individuals can share their often very painful stories and experiences but do not see an erosion of their existing rights when it comes to any other remedies or actions they may wish to take. I sincerely hope that many people will participate in the independent review to ensure that we have a thorough and meaningful review and that meaningful change can occur from this.</span>

The reason they gave is that cases that might be on foot could be impeded by reason that they would have things delivered in bulk, or pertinent documents that they wished to FOI but wouldn't be able to FOI, and, therefore, they wouldn't be able to pursue their case. I have been assured by some of those same people as recently as around half past three this afternoon that the amendment that has been drafted by the member for Warringah does that. There were some concerns in relation to whether documents could be dropped in bulk to the Human Rights Commission to serve the same purpose, but I am assured that that is not the case.</span>

I had a meeting with the minister this morning on this issue, and I want to acknowledge the agreement and the attitude of Minister Dutton in trying to make sure that we resolved this issue. Without any further delay, I would also like to commend this amendment.</span>

                  <a href="DZY" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:59</span>):  We've reached a point where the world is drowning in waste. Despite enormous efforts to implement kerbside recyclingâand I know most people put enormous effort into sorting their rubbish into the right binsâwaste continues to grow. In Australia, total waste has risen by 10 per cent from 68 million tonnes per annum to a record 76 million tonnes. Data shows that since 2016-17 Australia's recycling rates for plastics has dropped from an already unacceptably low 12 per cent to nine per cent. We're actually not meeting our own waste policy targets of reducing overall waste by 10 per cent by 2030 or achieving an 80 per cent average resource recovery rate from all waste streams by 2030.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that this is a big problem. All too often this results in us throwing our arms up and waiting for someone else to solve it. I believe the solution exists and we just need to work together to take advantage of the opportunities that a circular economy offers, because, one thing is for certain, if we find the right way to turn our waste into resources, our environment will benefit and so will our economy. This was a clear message this morning at the official launch of the Parliamentary Friends of Waste and Recycling. I'd like to also acknowledge the member for Fremantle, who's here in the chamber with us and who attended that group this morning. I thank the group's co-chairs, the member for Corangamite and the member for Bass, for their obvious dedication to the cause.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The guest speakers were Trish and Murray, who run The Plastics Circle. Instead of wringing their hands at the magnitude of the problem, it was refreshing to listen to Trish and Murray. They became so excited about the magnitude of opportunity. Amongst other things, The Plastics Circle works to remove the barriers to creating a real circle economy, helps businesses understand and manage their impacts of their packaging decisions and gets plastic out of the environment and back into circulation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my state of South Australia, we were one of the first states to introduce container deposit legislation in 1977, the first to ban lightweight checkout style plastic bags in 2009, and the first state to pass legislation banning single-use plastic products. We, in South Australia, lead the nation in recycling. We know that South Australians are enormously supportive of these initiatives, and so should be the rest of Australia. But if, despite these great initiatives and all our efforts, the vast majorityâ84 per cent or 2.1 million tonnesâof Australia's plastics waste is still sent to landfill each year, then we are still clearly doing something very wrong. I want South Australia and Australia to lead the world in establishing a circular economy. I want us to take advantage of the opportunities to create jobs and manufacturing opportunities to give waste a new life. In my electorate, I already have some fantastic companies and industries doing just this. We know that there's a strong appetite for recycled products. The data shows us that 23 per cent of consumers already buy based on sustainability and 81 per cent of consumers will buy more eco-friendly products over the next five years. The move to a circular economy must be delivered through economic investment and demand, because it will make it sustainable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also very important roles for government to play. Government can assist in establishing the infrastructure that we need for waste collection and movement. Government can ensure that its own procurement process mandates a percentage of recycled products, and they can mandate a minimum use of recycled material with government funded infrastructure projects. Legislation can create a framework to ensure greater producer responsibility and proper labelling so that consumers know exactly what they are buying. Governments can do all of that, but this government hasn't. Australia is desperate for leadership on this issue. We need our government and our leaders to talk about the economic opportunities of a circular economy, the jobs we can create through it, the skills and occupations that will be needed, and the environmental benefits. We have an enormous opportunity right before our eyes, and I am determined that we take advantage of it.</span>

As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker Wallace, the Heads of the River rowing regatta is one of the greatest events on the annual APS sporting calendar. It is with great pride that I inform the House that the Fairbairn Cup has returned to Bayside and Goldstein after the mighty Brighton Grammar School won the 153rd APS Heads of the River regatta last weekend. It's been 38 years since their last victory.</span>

They rowed their way to victory, edging out St Kevins and Scotch. Of course, they couldn't have done it by themselves, so a shout out to Oliver Dutton, the First VIII coach, and to Dick Bartlett, Director of Rowing. And all I can say is that we know it came down to the leadership of the headmaster, Ross Featherstone. Congratulations go, of course, not just to them but to their parents, siblings, friends and classmates who are all part of it. And congrats to BGS.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">A strong society is not built overnight, but through the development over time of citizens who take responsibility. We have many proud RSLs in the Bayside and Goldstein community and we have had a significant changeover at Hampton RSL, with Peter Lanigan, who has been president for the past 10 years, handing over to Lieutenant Commander Helen Ward. Peter helped to save the club in 2013 by selling some of the land of the club to pay off its debt. He advocated for funding for its Anzac Memorial Garden, which will be opened in April this year and he secured almost $10,000 in funding under the Saluting Their Service grants program in 2020 for the restoration of its cenotaph. And he has seen a massive growth in membership to over 300. I'd like to thank Peter and his wife, Ann, for all their service to our community and our country. And I congratulate Lieutenant Commander Helen Ward, who is the first female president of Hampton RSL and the only current female naval president in the state of Victoria elevated to this high office. I also thank all our servicemen and women and their families and all veterans for their devoted service to our nation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to congratulate Senior Constable Adam McKenzie. He has become a recipient of an Australian bravery decoration for his bravery, selflessly putting himself in jeopardy to protect the lives of others. He found himself in a car interception in South Melbourne at about 11.30 pm on 13 May 2008, following a gentleman by the name of Samir Ograzden. He found drugs, cash and a firearm. The occupant of the car, Sam Ograzden, was a convicted criminal. He fled the scene, pursued by two officers. He fired upon the police in the Kings Way car park, shooting one. As a consequence, he was eventually apprehended and, tragically, died. But it was a consequence of the great bravery of both officers that the person was apprehended.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:08</span>):  Tasmania is in the midst of a full-blown housing affordability and access crisis. We know what the problem is: a chronic lack of supply. Under Liberal governments in Tasmania, and here in Canberra, the supply of public and affordable housing has plummeted. As a result, we have young first home buyers competing with cashed-up investors. Increasingly, we have queues of desperate people, of all ages and from all walks of life, trying to find a place to rent. Many are being turned away and have to resort to tents, cars and sleeping bags in parks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It doesn't have to be this way. It should not be this way. The chronic shortage of housing supply could have been fixed, but the simple fact is that Peter Gutwein in Tasmania and the Prime Minister here in Canberra have made different choices. Their priorities do not include making housing more affordable. We have learned in recent weeks of extraordinary levels of waste, and I do mean absolutely massive waste in the JobKeeper program. Don't get me wrong: I support JobKeeper. Everybody on this side of the House does. In fact, we support it more than the government does, because we don't think it should be ending in three days! But there has been a massive waste of JobKeeper because there has been massive incompetence by this Treasurer. At least $10 billion and as much as $20 billion has been handed to companies that did not need it. The Liberals threaten pensioners with prison for overclaiming a few dollars on Centrelink but they're handing billions of dollars to companies that do not need government assistance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of this waste, the government does not have that $10 billion to spend on other things. It's a simple choice: with that money, the government could have built at least 40,000 affordable homes. What would that have done to the affordable housing crisis in this country? What a difference it would have made. Another choice the government could make is to keep JobKeeper going for another few months in sectors that have still not recovered from the travel restrictions that have so strangled businesses. Instead the government shrugs its shoulders and tells these wealthy companies and millionaire executives, 'Keep the money, don't worry about it'âprison for pensioners, taxpayer funded mansions for millionaires.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In three days, up to 150,000 Australians are expected to be told their jobs are gone. When the member for Rankin asked the Treasurer about this the other day, the Treasurer replied that he wasn't too worried about that because the unemployment rate wasn't expected to rise. The Treasurer was asked about people, real living breathing human beings with families to support, who in three days will be told they no longer have a job, and the Treasurer's response was to say that it wouldn't affect the stats. People are not statistics, Treasurer. The fact is that job security underpins everything for workers and their families. Without job security, there is no financial security. Without financial security, there is little ability to plan for the futureâand there is anxiety that feeds into everything working families care about. Without financial security, working families have nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why JobKeeper is so important: it isn't just about the money coming in the door; it's about keeping the connection with employment. We know that JobKeeper was meant to be temporaryâwe get thatâbut if our international borders are still closed then life is not back to normal. If we are only at a fraction of the promised four million vaccinations by the end of March, we are not back to normal. If we are not back to normal, why is the government ending assistance to businesses still affected by the pandemic? The end of JobKeeper will mean many businesses will have to lay off staff. They simply cannot afford to pay the wages because their business is still crippled by the lack of custom.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Almost 13,000 Tasmanians are still dependent on JobKeeper. How many will be getting a pink slip next week? In my electorate 2,700 workers are expected to lose JobKeeper, with $1.3 million a week in support ripped away from my local economy. It does not need to be this way. If the government had not wasted $10 billion giving handouts to profitable companies, it could afford to continue to support businesses and business sectors still doing it tough. Australians deserve a government that's on their sideâand this government ain't it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:14</span>):  It's often said that we have a universal healthcare system in Australia, but we don't. The further you live outside a big city, the worse your access to health care is likely to be. In some rural towns, there is no GP anymore. If you're diagnosed with diabetes, heart disease or another chronic condition, your quality of life is likely to be worse, and your life expectancy shorter, if you live in the outer suburbs, the regions or the bush.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I raise this because, in the electorate I represent on the Central Coast of New South Wales, we have an emerging GP crisis. The Central Coast is a popular place for young families and older people to live, but it's also a place where GPs books are closed and patients are waiting weeks for routine appointments. In the words of Dr Sachin Choudhary, who manages two practices on the Central Coast including the Lake Haven medical centre, 'We are in crisis and we need help.' Yet the Central Coast is not classified by this government as a distribution priority area for GPs, which means that recruiting and retaining GPs in our region is tough. I recently met with Belinda Field, CEO of Yerin Aboriginal Health Services in Wyong. Belinda is increasingly concerned about the challenges their health service is facing in recruiting and retaining GPs and the impact this is having on their patients. Yerin has 4,000 active patients and a four-week wait for routine appointments, and, in a region with one of the fastest-growing Aboriginal populations in Australia, they can't take on new patients. They're struggling to get by with eight part-time GPs. Belinda told me, 'The current classifications are a farce; we actually do have a shortage of GPs on the Central Coast,' and Belinda believes the rules must change to support GPs to work in our Aboriginal medical services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've also heard from Theresa Mason. Theresa manages the Central Coast Community Women's Health Centre. It was founded in 1976 and, for over four decades, has been providing support to local women through counselling, advocacy and legal advice at its centres in Wyoming, Wyong and Woy Woy. Until recently, the Central Coast Community Women's Health Centre also had three part-time GPs at their Wyoming clinic providing specialist women's health care. In Theresa's words: 'Our women's health GP clinic is a safe place for vulnerable women. Our services are provided by women for women, and 70 per cent of our services are bulk-billed. They are affordable.' But the centre, which receives referrals from across the Central Coast from women in crisis who are often really vulnerable, has had to advise patients that, from the end of this month, from the end of March, they will not have any doctors at the clinic, and they can't offer any future appointments until they can recruit replacement doctors. According to Theresa, they've been advertising for over 12 months and only managed to secure one GP who left a short time later. Theresa says others have been interested but only if the Central Coast was a distribution priority area. They are currently working with the primary health network to apply for the Area of Need Program as, without female GPs, they can't provide their specialist services, leaving, in Theresa's words, 'vulnerable women falling through the cracks'. This is a clinic which had 4,351 visits in 2019-20 of which nearly 30 per cent were for emotional and mental health, and the clinic now can't see patients. It's not good enough and it's not safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This shortage of GPs also impacts affordability. Across Australia, out-of-pocket costs for GP appointments have increased by 37 per cent since this government came to office. This is being felt by many people in my community, especially those who can least afford it. Dr Sachin Choudhary, who I mentioned earlier, urgently needs to recruit two GPs at each of the clinics that he manages. He wrote to me: 'Much to the disappointment of our GPs, who used to pride themselves in offering services at no cost to patients given the area's low socioeconomic demographic, we are gradually introducing co-payments to patients who can barely afford to pay.' I have written to the health minister this week to raise these urgent concerns. In the words of Theresa Mason, 'There is a critical shortage of GPs on the Central Coast.' As Belinda Field, the CEO of the Yerin Aboriginal Health Services, said, 'The current classifications are a farce.' And, as Dr Choudhary says, 'We are in crisis and we need help.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our community deserves better. As an MP and as a pharmacist, I'm calling on the government to act now to review these classifications and to urgently improve access to primary care in communities like mine. If people don't have access to GPs, they end up in crisis in ED. The cost to them and to our health system is too much. It must change. The government has to act now.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="G86" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FALINSKI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:19</span>):  The global pandemic has forced us to re-examine our national health system at a time when it has been placed under unprecedented stress. The regulation which restricts operators in the health space has created a strong disincentive for genuine innovation to occur. Despite the incredible inhibitions imposed by regulation, the Sargood centre, in Collaroy, is a world-class facility, helping those with spinal cord injuries. Their holistic approach means they also engage with families and carers of those with spinal injuries by equipping them to improve their lives. The Sargood centre is an outstanding example of what happens when specialists are allowed to innovate and start their own businesses to provide medical support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we are to productively engage with the long-term health challenges of our nation, we need regulation which empowers Australian healthcare providers. The success of the NDIS has essentially been one of partnering with individuals who know what they need better than any bureaucrat in Canberra could ever know. This is particularly the case with injuries which are complex and life-changing, like many of those related to spinal injuries. We need to be encouraging operators like the Sargood centre, who provide highly tailored rehabilitation depending on the individual and their unique circumstances, harnessing the innovative drive of the private sector, coupled with government support for individual choice. This is the trifecta of modern health care. This is how we will create affordable quality care into the future. There have only been a few moments in the history of our nation when there has been reason to pause and examine the state of our health system. The pandemic is one of these. There is an opportunity for us to partner with organisations like the Sargood centre in providing dynamic health solutions to some of our community's most vulnerable. The reality is we are already long overdue for healthcare reform, from how we administer Medicare and our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to private health insurance. We risk our medical centre stagnating at the time when we need it most, and the strain put on our healthcare system is only growing. The human cost of this is simply devastating.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our frontline workers in the medical profession are the backbone of our communityâfrom doctors and nurses to occupational and other therapists. We need to be providing these selfless workers in our community with conditions which do not see a typical working day place undue stress on them or their families. The Sargood centre provides a model in which the private sector can provide excellent quality of service whilst providing highly competitive conditions for employees. Whilst those working in health care do so to help others, it is our job and responsibility as a community to look after them. Overworked, stressed and impoverished healthcare workers should not be the norm in our hospitals or surgeries. Mental health issues are growing, a silent pandemic that continues to affect the lives of many on the Northern Beaches. Providing flexible working conditions is long overdue when it comes to our industrial relations regime. This is something that competition between healthcare providers can drive as they seek to attract and retain talent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is always encouraging when I see businesses in my electorate, like the Sargood centre, lead the way when it comes to providing Australians with world-leading health solutions. These are the kinds of businesses that we need to be incentivising to grow and develop. Starting a business is hard. Starting a business seeking to be an industry leader is rarely accomplished. For those few businesses that can make it, the last thing they want or need from their government is red tape which stops them employing more people and growing or innovating further. Sadly this is what the Fair Work Commission does on a regular basis. Health regulations, as they stand, are quite literally keeping Australians sick and impoverished. It's time to end the regulation racketeering that benefits a small elite at the top of a hierarchy at the expense of working Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I love most about our community on the Northern Beaches is that, despite all these challenges, organisations such as the Sargood centre continue to operate and flourish. They are drastically improving the lives of others. For their presence, innovative spirit and commitment, the Prime Minister came to honour their achievement. What they do cannot be accurately thanked in these words, but the example they set should not be ignored, and for that I thank them.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:00</span>):  It is with great sadness that I speak today about the loss of a remarkable leader, a remarkable Territorian, in Mr Jakamarra Nelson, who passed away, sadly, in  November last year. He has been described as a thorough gentleman who walked with ease in two worlds. He was born on Mount Doreen Station. When he was six years old, his family left for Yuendumu, a welfare depot, around 1946. He was the fifth of nine siblings and his father had four wives. Even though he only attended the community school until grade 5, he benefited from additional tuition by a Baptist missionary, Tom Fleming. 'I was lucky,' he recalled: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The whitefella missionary used to teach me after hours â¦ to give me extra education. That's where I managed to pick up my command of English.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He considered himself blessed to have had a two-way education, with regular breaks from settlement life. 'You'd go to church every Sunday, practise our culture every night if possible.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After a mechanic apprenticeship, Mr Nelson attended teachers college in Darwin and returned to Yuendumu school to teach, becoming one of the first Aboriginal teachers in Central Australia. After five years teaching, he joined the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to support the outstation movement as an assistant community adviser. 'He was an absolute champion of Aboriginal-led economic development, serving on the advisory committee of the Aboriginal Benefit Account and as a director of Yuendumu's Yapa-Kurlangu Ngurrara Aboriginal Corporation,' said Mr Martin-Jard, who was CEO of the Central Land Council. He was a lifelong advocate for truth-telling, and one of his last public appearances was as MC at the commemoration, in 2018, of the 90th anniversary of the notorious Coniston massacre at Yurkurru. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Nelson was a very close friend to me, a friend of over 35 years. He provided me with advice and support during the course of my many elections during that time. He was a true leader and a person of great intellect and knowledge. He was a strong voice and demanded to be heard. He was an absolute believer in and advocate for truth-telling, as I've already described, and the recognition of Aboriginal rights, and land rights in particular. We have lost a great friend, a great advocate and a true champion for his people, a leader of great passion and conviction. Vale, Jakamarra.</span>

I want to acknowledge the incredible work of people who have worked within our system, our community, who have come together to help out during this severe weather system and ongoing tragedy. Tragically, yesterday a young man lost his life due to the rising and fast-flowing floodwaters in north-west Sydney. This young man was part of Australia's 64,000-strong Pakistani community, a guest in our country. I want to pass on our sincere condolences from Australia, from our government, from our Prime Minister, from our parliament, to his family, his friends and his entire community. I want to thank the Pakistani community for reaching out to me in north-west Sydney so that I can help the family at this time. It was his first day on a job. It's a disaster for the family of this young man, so we pass on our thoughts and condolences to them.</span>

I want to thank Daniel McGovern, the Hills SES commander, and every single one of the Hills SES volunteers who are out on the ground, and have been for a number of days now, fighting to stem a very difficult emergency and doing their absolute best in a very difficult emergency situation. We've seen the pictures on TV of emergency personnel upturned in boats, putting their lives on the lineâthey're doing it all the time to protect life and propertyâand selflessly working to make sure people are safe and fed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the Castle Hill RSL for opening their doors as an evacuation centre. I know some people have come. Some people thought it was a bit far, but, actually, Castle Hill RSL are well appointed to take people from everywhere. They're very generous. They do it all the time. If it's fires or floods, they just open up their club, and they do a great job of looking after people. I know that the people there have been well looked after.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank The Hills Shire Council, St John Ambulance, the Red Cross, Anglicare, NSW Health, the police force, everyone who's on the groundâdoing everything they can at the moment, working alongside our emergency services workersâthe state and federal governments working together, and, of course, the community, who are doing everything in between, in situations where the emergency services can't be there. Sometimes creeks flood and they don't even show up on government maps, and communities rally together to sandbag houses to protect property. They come together as a community, protect themselves and do a great job of doing that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're very fortunate to have these amazing people across our community. We're fortunate to have the ADF now on the groundâboots on the ground; choppers in the air. The federal government will be supporting the state government effort. For this one-in-50-year flood, the cost is not known, the difficulties are not over and the challenges are going to continue. We're going to be right there to make sure, as a community, that we get through this together. We say to everyone: 'Please be safe. Please look after each other. Don't take risks. This danger is not over.'</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DAVID SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bean</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:06</span>):  Last Thursday, I had the privilege of meeting with some brilliant scientists and engineers through the Science Meets Parliament program, hosted by Science &amp; Technology Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Science Meets Parliament is Australia's premier event connecting emerging STEM leaders with decision-makers, improving communication and understanding of our world-leading work across science, technology, engineering and maths. Science &amp; Technology Australia do extraordinary work. They're also responsible for the Superstars of STEM program, and it was a privilege to work closely with them when I worked for Professionals Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This program is more important than ever. In recent decades, the STEM community, even whilst being undermined by some, has worked furiously to both communicate and address the consequence of climate change. It is through their expertise that we learnt of the threat, and, through science and engineering, we shall hopefully conquer it. More recently, the STEM community has been thrown the challenge of COVID-19 and has ably stepped up to the challenge despite all the difficulties of lockdowns and a disrupted global system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rohan Byrne was one individual who joined these efforts when he delayed his graduation in order to contribute to the pandemic response. A planetary scientist and cross-disciplinary engineer, Rohan contributes to the vital modelling of various scientific phenomena. From preventing death, we move to the creation of life with Ms Pia Astbury, an embryologist running an IVF lab. Ms Astbury was awarded a Dean's Commendation for Academic Excellence at UQ and has had her work published widely. All the while, she has struggled with dyslexia and dyscalculia. Pia is an inspiring young scientist and seeks to mentor and advocate for young women that wish to step into the pivotal world of STEM, as well as advocating for key changes to fertility education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Looking skyward is Dr Natasha Hurley-Walker, a passionate radio astronomer. Holding her PhD from Cambridge, Dr Hurley-Walker is working towards the delivery of the world's biggest telescope, the SKA, in Australia and South Africa. She is a true superstar of STEM. Deep under the earth's crust lies Dr Teresa Ubide's research as a vulcanologist. Dr Ubide has researched the nature of volcanoes and their triggering mechanisms, bringing us closer to understanding how and when a volcano will erupt, research that will be vital for many countries in our region that are in the Ring of Fire.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Sarah Atkinson and Dr Janna Fabris are both part of the third cohort of the Australian Science Policy Fellowship Program, a program that is injecting experienced science and engineering professionals back into the Australian Public Service agenciesâa good program, championed by Australia's Chief Scientist. This is just a taste of the great work being done by our scientists in this country. We need to back this great work with a greater commitment to ongoing, certain careers across industry, academia and the public sector. Our future depends upon doing so.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="245550" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms FLINT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:09</span>):  Last week our local community secured a significant win for environmental and heritage protection with the decision by the state government to save the historic Waite Gatehouse. The Waite Gatehouse, or the lodge, as it is also known, sits prominently on the outer edge of the Waite Arboretum, and forms part of a substantial bequest from Peter Waite to the University of Adelaide and, in turn, to the people of South Australia. It is a striking 130-year-old bluestone structure and an important example of South Australia's early built heritage. It used to be the home to the head groundsman responsible for maintaining the gardens and arboretum, and it's situated on the 54-hectare property. Even South Australians who don't know the details of the gatehouse know this building, because it sits on the corner of Cross Road and Fullarton Road. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks to consistent community pressure, including from me, from the member for Waite, Sam Duluk MP, and from local community groups such as the Mitcham Historical Society, the Friends of Waite Arboretum, the Friends of Urrbrae House, which is nearby, and many others, the state government has succumbed to community pressure to preserve and move this iconic structure. The gatehouse will be carefully moved, stone by stone, by heritage experts and rebuilt at another location within the Waite Historic Precinct. This will eliminate the risk of the building being damaged or collapsing, had they tried to move it as a full relocation of the structure all at once. The University of Adelaide will continue to have care of the gatehouse within the precinct, and they have suggested a location within the arboretum near the historic and grand Urrbrae House, the original home of Peter Waite and his family. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most exciting, though, is that, once the rebuild is complete, the University of Adelaide will undertake a full refurbishment of the interior so it can finally be used again. It will become a home for the many community groups who look after this wonderful precinct, including the Friends of Waite Arboretum, the Friends of Urrbrae House, the Mitcham Historical Society and others. I'm really delighted that it will be part of living heritage and used by so many wonderful community volunteers. Once again, I would like to commend all those who took part in this community actionâin particular Sam Duluk MP, Professor Warren Jones, and everyone who signed the petition, which attracted over 8,700 signatures and 18,000 names online. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now that we're able to move the gatehouse, the vital road upgrade at the corner of Cross Road and Fullarton Road can go ahead. This is absolutely important for our local community. It's a terrible traffic snarl every single day at morning peak hour and evening peak hour. As we know, we have Urrbrae high school right on that corner, so we need to look after the safety of all of those students, the safety of their parents and the safety of our community and fix this traffic problem once and for all. </span>

                  <a href="159771" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms ROWLAND</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Greenway</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:12</span>):  I rise to update the House on the grand opening of first-class amenities in my electorate of Greenway: the Pearce Reserve cricket pavilion in Kings Langley. An upgraded pavilion has long been a vision of the Kings Langley Cricket Club and I pay tribute to their work in making this project a reality. This was truly a grassroots led movement, with the club and other associated entities leading the charge to ensure cricket players in Greater Western Sydney will enjoy the same quality of amenities as players in other parts of Sydney. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the club has done more than improve local amenities; it's reminded the rest of Sydney that Western Sydney is a sporting destination and a place of excellence. I was proud to help to deliver the federal support for this important project, and to join with representatives from Blacktown City Council and the club in opening these facilities recently. Congratulations to the Kings Langley Cricket Club on the opening of these wonderful amenities, and I'm sure they'll be enjoyed right across the community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I take this opportunity to acknowledge an important milestone for the Bangladeshi diaspora both in Greenway and, indeed, around Australia and the world: the 50th anniversary of Bangladesh's independence. Bangladeshi Australians have, over many years, made such positive contributions to our community. I've had the great privilege to represent residents of Bangladeshi heritage in Western Sydney for over 15 years, both as a local councillor and deputy mayor of Blacktown City, and now as the member for Greenway. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While doing this runs the risk of leaving someone out, I would like to firstly acknowledge a few individuals: Sheik Hauque, Surajit Roy, Nur Rehman, Lovely Rehman and Noman Shamim. Your advocacy, education and guidance over the matters impacting Bangladeshi Australians in our community has been invaluable. Australia and Bangladesh have a proud history of mutual understanding and close friendship. Indeed, Australia was the first developed country to recognise Bangladesh's independence in 1971, a great year. As we confront unique and complex challenges in our region, I am certain that Australia and Bangladesh will continue to do so together to bring peace and economic stability across the Indo-Pacific region. My heartfelt congratulations to all Bangladeshi Australians on this momentous occasion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to acknowledge the many students who completed their HSC studies last year. As we all know, 2020 was the most difficult year for students in probably a century, and I commend both students and teachers across Greenway for the way in which they adapted to the challenges posed by the pandemic. I don't know how I would have coped as a student during these conditions, so I commend you all. In light of this, it was absolutely wonderful to attend the Afghan Community Support Association recognition ceremony in Blacktown recently to celebrate the efforts of HSC students who graduated in 2020 and also to acknowledge a large number of volunteers. The ACSA is doing incredible things in our community, including providing support to students of Afghani heritage. The achievements and stories of students were truly inspiring. Our future is safe in their hands and, indeed, in the hands of all of Greenway's young people. Congratulations, one and all! </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="109556" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LEESER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:15</span>):  I want to take a moment to respond to the passionate pleas across Australia that we've heard over the last few weeks. It's impossible for me as a man to fully understand and appreciate what women have been through, but I want to at least try to respond to the important messages that I've been hearing. Hearing how many young women have been sexually assaulted is one of the most confronting of all of the shocks of the past month. We're failing our girls, and our boys, if we don't do something to turn this around.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Pornography, alcohol abuse and deep cultural undercurrents that teach boys to sexualise rather than respect their female peers cannot be allowed to continue. Women have been telling Australia they have had enough; they're sick of the way things have been for generations and they want real change. Women are telling us that, if they are to achieve real equality, we must ensure first and foremost that they are safeâsafe in their homes, safe as they walk about the streets of their cities and towns, safe in their schools, safe at university, safe in their workplaces and, most importantly, safe in this place, the Parliament of Australia. They're also telling us they're sick of being treated as second-class citizensâsick of being ignored, sick of being patronised, sick of being denigrated, sick of being left out. This is a confronting message but it's a vital message, and it's a vital message that we men in this place have to hear.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the question is: what do we do about it? The Jenkins review is an important step. It's an independent review with multipartisan support, giving staff, MPs and senators the chance to provide open and honest feedback about the culture of parliament and to provide suggestions on what we should do and what we can do to make the parliament a safe and welcoming place to work. As an individual, I'm going to try to lead by example. I think too often where there have been issues of poor conduct of colleagues or people we work with, whether it's here or in other places, we men have turned a blind eye. That's got to stop, and it's got to stop now. We can no longer be bystanders. We've all got to put our hands up to do better. We've all got to adopt the motto: 'If you see something, say something, and do something about it.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, I commit to redoubling my efforts to provide opportunities for women to experience working in this placeâthis parliamentâwhere I proudly worked as a staffer and now serve as an MP, and where people come from across the country to do great things for their community and their country, motivated by the highest ideals. I commit to encouraging and helping more women to stand for public office, and to spending what political capital I have to help get them there. I commit to making Australia a better, safer, more tolerant place for women so that they can take their full place in our society, a place that has far too often been denied to them. I call on all men around the country to join in these efforts as well.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:18</span>):  A heartfelt thank you to my colleague opposite for those words.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tomorrow will be such a wonderful celebration for the vibrant Bangladeshi communities in the electorate of Lalor and right across the nation. Tomorrow is the golden jubilee of Bangladeshi independence and the celebration of the birth of the father of the nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. There will be many celebrations to mark this special occasion. There will be parades, gatherings, flag-raising ceremonies and concertsâeven a little bit of cricket in my electorateânot just here in Parliament House in Canberra but across the nation as our local Bangladeshi communities celebrate this important day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the vice-chair of the Australian Bangladeshi parliamentary group, I'm proud of not only what this day celebrates but also our two nations' strong and long history. Australia was the first developed nation in the world to recognise Bangladesh, so it's no surprise our two nations share such a long and proud history of cooperation. Our new parliamentary friendship group will build on this shared history into the future, creating person-to-person relationships that will support both our countries in building democracy to support our peoples.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what I discussed recently with His Excellency Mohammad Sufiur Rahman, the Bangladeshi High Commissioner to Australia, when we met in Canberra to discuss the 50th anniversary of independence and our two countries. I say to His Excellency: I'm sorry I'm unable to mark this auspicious occasion with you, but no doubt many more events will be held in the future to celebrate our two nations and the new parliamentary friendship group.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Given this may be my last chance to rise in the House prior to the May sitting week, I want to pass on my best wishes to all in Lalor for the celebration of Easter. Easter means a lot of things for a lot of people. For many it is a time that carries deep meaning. It is a time for worship, for reflection, and it is a special opportunity for families to come together. Following the disruption of last year, I hope that, for those who celebrate this day religiously, a more normal marking of these three days is possible. Easter can also just be a day filled with chocolate, family and loved ones. But for many in our community it will be another day of work, and to you I say: thank you for making our time with family more enjoyable, safer and easier. You deserve your penalty rates, and Labor will fight tooth and nail to protect them. Whether Easter is a day of church or chocolate, fish on Good Friday or a weekend at the beach, stay safe on the roads, enjoy your time with loved ones and have a very happy Easter. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To finish, I met with students at my SRC forum last Friday, and I want to share with the House their feedback about their teachers. They are absolutely grateful and appreciative of all of the effort their teachers put in during the pandemic. More importantly they're appreciative of the person-to-person education that's happening in their classrooms now. </span>

Ian Telfer is with WA Plantation Resources. WAPRES have a large and secure share of the wood fibre industry in WA, managing over 28,000 hectares of sustainable plantations across the South West, and they operate across all phases of the wood fibre production chain. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Warren is in charge at Wespine, located in Dardanup in this hub area. They produce 500,000 cubic metres of timber product every year. They use cutting-edge technology to ensure that every bit of the log is used, creating high-quality, precision-made timber housing, packaging and landscaping products for customers right across Australia. It's a very innovative company. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to talk about Danny Griffin and his crew at Laminex. They've been a proud Australian manufacturer for over 85 years. In their Dardanup facility in WA they manufacture raw particle board and MDF. They certainly use every part of the products they get. It is a real circular economy, our renewable, sustainable industry that is timber. At Laminex, the other day, I met two 40-year-service employees. I was really proud to meet them and to hear about their experiences in their 40 years at Laminex. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also met again with Geoff Brookes, who is an amazing, innovative owner of Preston Chipping. In talking about the forestry sector, we can't forget the logistics and every job behind the wheel of a truck that goes with it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also in my part of the world we have the Wellington Discovery Forest centre, with self-walk trails through the forest. You can get information and insight into jarrah forest ecology and how the forest is managed from actual foresters. It's an eco-education excursion offered to school groups. There's also accommodation. It's an exceptional learning experience about the truth around our forests. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally I want to mention the Leschenault Hoo Hoo Club. For anybody who understands and is involved in forestry, they had a very good event recently. The hoo-hoo club offers education around forestry for younger generations. They work to build unity across the forest products and timber industry right around the world and provide opportunities for learning across the industry from experts and peers with years of experience. Well done!</span>

He's drawn my attention to a matter which involves some 3,000 ex national servicemen of the over 15,000 who served in the war in South Vietnam from 1965 to 1972. He has alerted me to a problem which I think needs to be rectified in the parliament by the government. He's proposing that national service personnel and some others who served at least 60 days on active service in South Vietnam be rewarded the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal. The Defence Honours and Awards Appeals Tribunal informs me it has twice considered this or similar proposals and rejected the idea. The case has since been reviewed by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs but was rejected on the grounds that the government cannot change the criteria of a medalâthat is, people had to have served in theatre for 180 days or more. Mr Barry makes the very good point that the criteria used by the tribunal perhaps need to be reconsidered. There should be a different consideration: that Australia has delegated an enduring sovereign power to determine the eligibility of its own personnel for this foreign campaign medal in a manner that is ethical and equitable. Furthermore, it would be consistent with the motives of the then government of the Republic of Vietnam.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem in essence is that some national servicemen and others missed out on receiving this campaign medal because their period of national service obligation expired before they completed a nominal 181 days in South Vietnam. These national servicemen were absolutely under no obligation to extend their service. Some did, but most wished to return to their pre national service life and employment, and rightly so. But, as Mr Barry draws to my attention, it's now high time to settle the matter. Providing this campaign medal award will require political will rather than black-letter legal interpretations. Sixty thousand Australians served in Vietnam and 47,000 of them have received medical care for some 200,000 conditions. I truly believe that the recognition of the campaign medal will go some way to assisting people to try and make sense of that period of service 50 years ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is widespread community support for the proposal from senior ex-service people and ex-service organisations. The proposition is that, if people served in the Vietnam War and didn't do 181 days merely because their service obligations finished, it shouldn't bar them from receiving a campaign medal which is to do with people's actions there. It is ethically and morally appropriate to right this wrong. What we need is a determination from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs that national service personnel who served at least 60 days but less than 181 days should receive the campaign medal.</span>

Bill Rathbone from Goonellabah has been awarded a Bravery Medal for displaying considerable bravery when undertaking multiple rescues of people trapped in flood waters in 2015. Bill put himself in danger during extreme weather conditions, flash flooding and wind gusts of up to 100 kilometres per hour. In one of the rescues, he saw a vehicle had been washed from the road and was stranded in the rising floodwater. The driver had managed to climb onto the roof of the vehicle. Bill and a group of others were able to throw a rope to the stranded man, anchoring it to a light pole. They then waded into waist-deep water and placed a ladder on the roof of the stranded car, allowing the trapped man to climb to safety. It's a remarkable story.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, Leanne Chamberlain from Caniaba and Mary-Ann Hyde from Wollongbar have been awarded a commendation for brave conduct for their actions during a roof collapse at Lismore Base Hospital in 2015. During a severe hailstorm, scaffolding fell onto the roof of the hospital, which caused the ceiling to fall in on the maternity ward. Debris was everywhere, the hot water mains burst and live electrical wires were exposed. Leanne and Mary-Ann were crucial in ensuring the five mothers and their newborn babies were not injured. Leanne courageously threw herself across a mother and baby to shield them from falling debris. Despite being surrounded by falling ceiling panels and water, Mary-Ann slid across a wall to reach distressed babies to get them to safety.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's great to see many local shows are bouncing back this year after being cancelled last year. The 92nd Bonalbo Show is coming up on 16 and 17 April and is one of the great shows in our community. I'd like to acknowledge the show's society members and stewards who make this event happen: the president, David Whitney; vice-presidents, Don Johnston and James Fraser; treasurer, Todd Weston; secretary, Michelle Malt; and committee members, Merlene Allen, Darryl Amos, who's the chief steward, Tom Amos, Paul Johnston senior, Ellen Lowe, Colleen McQueen, Clive Newton, Owen Osborne, Neal Taylor, Libby Johnston, Chris Whitney, Joy Whitney, Rachel Newton and James Fraser. I want to thank them all for putting the show on this year, and I encourage everyone to go along for what will be a wonderful event.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  by leaveâI'll continue where I left off last night, when there was a division in the House of Representatives and the Federation Chamber was adjourned. I was talking about jobs and jobs creation, and the industrial relations bill from this government and how it would be detrimental to our economy. I say so because, as I said last night, to very quickly recap, it would make it harder for people to negotiate their EBAs at work; it would lower wages, in fact; and it would obviously give us a two-tier system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not the way to go whilst we have the coronavirus crisis taking place, which has devastated the economy. What we need to do is ensure that we do get some wage growth and better productivity and that there is money in workers' pockets so they can spend. We know, when there's money available at the lower income end, that money goes straight back into the economy. We know, if you give someone who is on a very low wage an extra $30, $50 or $100, it will go into necessities that are requiredâfor example, buying shoes, which you've put off doing for a long time because you can't afford it, or getting the washing machine that you need because your current one has broken down. This will grow the economy, and we should be looking at ways of putting money in the pockets of lower-end-income earners and those who perhaps can't afford the things that high-income earners can afford. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This particular budget was an experiment in subsidising big business to create demand. That was according to Michael Pascoe, who reported this in The New Daily. Of course we want businesses to thrive, of course we want them to succeed and grow, and I understand how vitally important they are to our economy. However, businesses cannot succeed if people do not have enough money in their pockets, after they've paid for the essentials, to spend on goods and services. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians deserve to have a government on their side, and they would get exactly that under Labor. We heard the Leader of the Opposition speak about a plan focusing on delivering jobsâgood, secure jobs, with fair pay and conditions. And we on this side of the House certainly would not be cutting penalty rates or trying to introduce legislation that makes it easier for employers to keep their employees in precarious or casual employment, let alone making it harder for employees to take action against wage theft. Over the last few years, we've seen some horrendous stories of systematic wage theft by some of the biggest multinationals that operate in this country. There are things the government has tried to introduce through industrial relations legislation that make it harder to take action against wage theft and that put employees in precarious or casual employment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side of the House have a clear plan for secure, fairly paid jobs. We will make job security an object of the Fair Work Act 2009 so that it becomes the core focus for the Fair Work Commission's decisions. The Leader of the Opposition also spoke about extending the powers of the Fair Work Commission to include employee-like forms of work, allowing it to better protect people in new forms of work, like app-based gig work, from exploitation and dangerous working conditions. We've seen an explosion of these jobs in the last few years, where they're paid very little. They barely make the minimum wage and they're put in dangerous situationsâriding bikes in traffic et cetera. On this side, we will be legislating for a fair, objective test to determine when a worker can be classified as a casual so that people have a clearer pathway to permanent work, and also to limit the number of consecutive fixed-term contracts an employer can offer for the same role with an overall cap of 24 months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fixed-term contracts and casual work are to the detriment of the economy because, if you are a casual worker, it is difficult to get a loan; it is difficult to make arrangements for the futureâeven though some of these casual jobs are ongoing and contracts are renewed from three-monthly terms onwards. So we would look at ways of making those jobs permanent after a period of time. We'd also work with the state and territory governments, the unions and industry to develop portable entitlement schemes for annual leave, sick leave and long service leave for Australians in insecure work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government also has no plan to help working families and especially to boost women's workforce participation. We do, though, through the working family childcare boost that was announced a few months ago by the member for Kingston and the Leader of the Opposition. The plan is to scrap the $10,560 childcare subsidy cap, which often sees women losing money from an extra day's work. We will also lift the maximum childcare subsidy rate to 90 per cent and increase childcare subsidy rates and taper them for every family earning less than $550,000. This will result in around 97 per cent of families in the system saving between $600 and $2,900 a year, with no family being worse off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you are in an economic crisis, one of the other areas of importance is infrastructure. Infrastructure is an important lever for the economy, and, as we saw in the global financial crisis, massive infrastructure ensured that we got the economy going. Yet my constituents in the western suburbs of my electorate will be facing another 15 years of uncertainty and delays before the South Road upgrade is completed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in 2013, the then Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, pledged to upgrade South Road within a decadeâand that was an election promise. Documents leaked last year by members of the state Liberal government in South Australia show that the South Road upgrade may not be completed until possibly 2035. We need that money to be pumped into infrastructure today, now, to create jobs and to get the infrastructure that's needed for the future. That leak that came from the state Liberal Party members in South Australia shows that this road will be completed over a decade later than was originally promised by the Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, in 2013. Not only does this mean continued uncertainty for businesses and residents along South Road, at a time when business confidence is at an all-time low, but also it delays the creation, as I said, of much-needed jobs and the input of money into the economy in South Australia, my own state, which has the highest unemployment rate in the country at the moment. So it's desperately needed that they start work on this infrastructure project as soon as possible, to keep the economy going and give certainty to those residents in those suburbs all along South Roadâlike Mile End, Thebarton and Torrensvilleâthat need the infrastructure. We need these jobs now, not in 15 years, and we need the infrastructure now, not in 15 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that putting money into infrastructure creates jobs and helps the economy, and we're not doing enough of it. We are not seeing the projects that are required. For example, the Main North Road intersection in my electorate at Medindie is a bottleneck. Back in 2016 we were promised that this would be fixed, yet nothing has started, no plans are in placeâthere is absolutely no focus on when it will be done. I get calls every day in my electorate office about that intersection and the bottleneck that it causes. It can take anything up to 30 minutes just to get out of that particular bottleneck to reach the next stage, which is half a kilometre away. We need it fixed now. The residents of Adelaideâespecially in the suburbs of Prospect, Medindie, Walkerville and Sefton Parkâwant it fixed immediately. We need this infrastructure. As I've said, the infrastructure that we create creates jobs, helps the economy and ensures that people have a smoother ride when they are driving their cars in traffic et cetera.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="249147" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KEOGH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:39</span>):  We are a country that punches well above its weight in so many things. We traditionally finish in the top five at the Olympics despite being so much smaller than our competition. We invented wi-fi, the black box, spray-on skin and the cochlear implant. We are world leaders in mining and sub-sea oil and gas. We have handled the COVID crisis better than most in the world. In World War II, we made the Boomerang fighter aircraft, and just now it is Australia that is leading the world in autonomous aircraft with the Loyal Wingman. So why is it that we are so doubtful about the potential of our defence industry and our own capability? We are competitive with other nations on so many other things. We have the skills, the resources and the thirst for work, but the simple fact is: we as a nation don't back ourselves in our defence industry. The Australian Defence Force is a fantastic customer of the global defence industry supply chain, but why can't we, Australia, be its primary supplier instead?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was the crux of a conversation I had recently with a successful Australian defence industry business. They're doing well, participating in some major international defence projects which benefit our ADF but are largely for foreign primes and overseas forces, but they have the capacity to do so much more. In my discussions with the defence industry more broadly, I'm told the same thing time and time again: they look for export tenders and contracts overseas in order to be deemed 'legit' by our own Department of Defence; at the same time, they are fighting for those overseas contracts with one hand tied behind their back, because they can't point to contracts with our own ADF. We need a paradigm shift. We need our government and the Department of Defence to back our Australian defence industry businesses as a necessary and important strategic capability right up there with our naval, land and air platforms themselves. While this means taking on the risk that comes with fostering local companies, we can embrace the reward. We know full well that equipment designed and built overseas presents many other risks in any event. Ultimately, weâour governmentâneed to back ourselves. Already, through the COVID-19 pandemic, not only have we been well down the list when it comes to sourcing PPE and commencing our vaccine rollout; we've been victims of vaccine nationalism, where countries have prioritised their own interests over their international export contracts. Why would we expect this to be any different in a conflict situation?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Aussie spirit of mateship is alive and well in our defence industry and beyond. When we need something to happen, we pull together to make it so. We saw this during the response to the bushfires of Christmas 2019, when HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Canberra</span> and HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Adelaide</span> were deployed to the New South Wales South Coast fully stocked in a matter of hours due to the fact that local companies pulled together to get it done. We know that we can do what's needed when it's required, and this is the mindset we need for all of our defence industry projects. Australian defence companies don't want to be just building to spec parts off a ship blueprint that was developed decades prior or that came from overseas. There's no strategic or sovereign capability development in that. In fact, it leads us to use old and obsolete technology and to a deskilling of our industrial base. We should instead be commissioning Australian companies on an outcomes basis. If we need something for our defence kit, Australian companies should have the opportunity to put forward unique solutions. This provides the opportunity for research, development and innovation in the sector. In order to enable this, the Commonwealth must have skin in the game. It's not enough to put a contract out to tender and let international prime companies get away with 'best-endeavour' provisions, advising that Australian companies don't have the capacity or capability to undertake specific work and favouring existing, often international, supply chains.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian defence industry needs to be enabled by the Commonwealth. From the Minister for Defence down, there must be a new approach. The 'A' in AIC should be about homegrown, Australian owned, Australian registered businesses. The 'C' in AIC must truly be about our sovereign capability, not just content, which, under the current government's guidelines, could mean hotels, travel agents and language classes just as easily as it could mean building ships and designing new technology.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That means that building and developing things here in Australia should be our priority. If we don't have the specific capability here, we must nurture and build that capability strategically. We must develop and foster our current mid-tier defence industry businesses from which we can grow Indigenous prime defence contractors. There is no reason that Australia can't be a world leader in defence manufacturing. If undertaken effectively, homegrown prime defence contractors will be enabled to take the lead on projectsâno longer simply subcontracting to foreign lead contractors but rather working directly with Defence to provide new capabilities and platforms to our ADF. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, we should be using Australians in all future shipbuilding programs, not just in shipbuilding labour but also in the design, engineering, drafting and integration work. A good start to that would be providing certainty for shipbuilding workers in Osborne and Henderson, who have been waiting with bated breath since December 2019 for an answer about the location where full-cycle docking work will occur for our Collins class submarines. This government has torpedoed any hopes that those workers had of certainty this week, when it yet again fluffed its way through Senate estimates, refusing to give any real answers on anything. Ultimately, it is vital that we continually invest in the development of our industry and our overall capability here at homeâsomething that, at this rate, the government seems more interested in sinkingâbe it in Western Australia, South Australia or elsewhere across the country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government and Naval Group confirmed this week that a revised strategic partnership agreement has finally been signed in relation to the Attack class future submarines, but no minister has actually read the amendments to that document. Last month, I had the pleasure of meeting with the Naval Group global chief executive, Pierre Pommellet, when he was at parliament for talks with Commonwealth officials on a range of issues, including a 60 per cent minimum spend on the Future Submarine project. It was a shame he didn't have the same opportunity to meet with the actual Minister for Defence. We discussed the agreement he was yet to finalise with the Commonwealth, in which there would be a 60 per cent spend minimum in the course of the build of all 12 future submarines. That means that the 60 per cent minimum won't be reached until the very end. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm disappointed that the Morrison government is keeping the details on thisâand any potential for penalties against Naval if they don't meet these requirementsâa complete secret, under the guise of commercial-in-confidence, despite the fact that there is no competitive process now. Naval are the ones building these submarines. There's no competitive process at all. So we've been seeking the definitions of 'spend' and 'content', and what the government is including in this minimum 60 per cent that it now says it has committed to, but, even after a full day of defence estimates yesterday, we are none the wiser. It is all part of the don't-ask, don't-tell mentality that we continue to see under the Morrison government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This uncertainty, though, for business and for Aussie jobsâand, frankly, this government's complete inability to support the future of a sovereign Australian defence industryâis just appalling. We're running in silent mode, stealth mode, when these things should really be coming to the surface. We keep trying to dive deeper, but the government won't give any of the information. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's why Labor has already committed to implementing concrete rules to maximise local content and create local jobs for defence acquisitions. It means negotiating appropriate, specific, enforceable and audited AIC commitments into the contractual arrangements on all major defence materiel procurements and local defence contracts. The disclosure of these commitments must be public and transparent. Labor's policy would not only create ongoing Australian jobs; it would further develop Australia's sovereign capability, ensuring workers are technically skilled up not just to build defence equipment but to maintain, upgrade and augment it into the future. A future Labor government would also ensure that at least one in every 10 jobs in major projects, defenceâincluding future defence programsâor otherwise were filled by an apprentice. We need to rebuild the nation's manufacturing industry with a comprehensive plan to create jobs, boost viable skills, bring industry expertise back onshore and supercharge our collective national productivity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know this government has no understanding of supporting Aussie businesses. Yesterday, it was revealed that the Treasury expects that up to 150,000 people will lose their jobs as a consequence of the government's withdrawal of JobKeeper in just three days, this Sunday. Some experts have even said that the number could be as high as 250,000 jobs lost. The Morrison government has no plan for the economy and no plan to support Australian businesses and workers. The only suggestion, with three days left until JobKeeper is withdrawn, is Centrelink encouraging people to sign up early to ensure they can receive the JobSeeker payment, which is around 60 per cent of the JobKeeper payment that these people will be losing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor, on the other hand, does have a plan for Aussie jobs. We want to create a defence industry development strategy which will better leverage the $270 billion investment pipeline, develop sovereign industrial and research capabilities and build skills and expertise within the Australian workforce. We need to put Australian industry, workers and security first with a framework to maximise and with public disclosure of local content for all major defence materiel procurements. We're also looking to improve our manufacturing skillset and capability through a national rail manufacturing plant to see more trains built here in Australia by local workers with local know-how. Maybe that will make sure that they can actually fit through the tunnels and into the stations that we already have. We need to ensure that every dollar of federal funding spent on rail projects boosts our local jobs and our local industry, and the same has to be said for Defence as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the current trajectory, we are at risk of seeing a continued decrease in local Defence work in favour of offshore suppliers, with all the international supply chain risks that entails, which has been very much highlighted over the last 12 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. It's up to the federal government to implement contractual requirements that compel Defence primes to do the work here in Australia and work with local companies now to put in place the mechanisms to grow Australian defence industry, from SMEs up to primes. There are minimum levels that are only met at the end of a project, with no transparency. That's not good enough. Australian companies need to be factored into the Defence project supply chain from the very beginningâinvolved in design, involved in engineering, involved in developing capability, involved in the technological developments for the whole life of a platform's build and ongoing sustainment. We must share the risk and put our skin back into the game, and, frankly, we need to back ourselves in Defence, like we do in the Olympics.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:52</span>):  It is somewhat difficult to support two bills that appropriate $2.64 billion of public money from a directionless, divided and shambolic eight-year-old government that has not only lost its moral compass but also arrogantly believes that it is above the law and is not accountable to the parliament or the Australian people. It is a government that has used and abused its power for its own political benefit; a government that has treated billions of dollars of public funds as coalition slush funds, while hounding vulnerable people who desperately try to make ends meet on welfare payments; a heartless government with a disgraceful record of human rights abuses in its treatment of refugees; a government that has presided over some of the worst cases of neglect and abuse of older people in aged care and under which, even after a scathing royal commission report and over 20 previous reports, older people are still suffering; a government that still fails to understand the extent of discrimination against women in Australian society and thinks that comforting words and platitudes will suffice; a government that has stacked government boards, judicial appointments and senior Public Service positions with ex coalition politicians, staffers, political sympathisers or supporters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that not only has used public money to line the pockets of its mates with those appointments, which often pay hundreds of thousands of dollars, but also has paid millions of dollars above market prices for property. Then there is Murray-Darling Basin water and other government contracts. We heard only this week of a nearly $4 million feasibility study for a new coal-fired power station that was never, ever going to be built. There was the Leppington Triangle land sale, where $30 million was paid to an alleged Liberal mate for land worth only $3 million, and the land was then released back to the seller at the true market value of, I believe, less than $2 million. How can the government do that and believe that it's unaccountable to the Australian people?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was also the payment of almost $13 million more for Murray-Darling Basin water than was advised by an independent valuer. There were several examples of that. And there was the $423 million contract for security on Manus Island awarded to an unknown company called Paladin. It's no wonder that the Morrison government does not want a Commonwealth integrity commission, something that Labor has been calling for for years. The government talks about it, talks about how it's consulting, but deliberately drags its feet and sidesteps the issue. Why? Because it knows that a national integrity commission would very likely look at the very issues that I have just referred to. Indeed, when the Auditor-General looked at some of these matters, we saw that the Auditor-General's budget was cut because it had found anomalies and was very critical of the government in the way it was expending money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government does the same with respect to giving First Nations people a voice. Again, there is a lot of talk, lots of propositions, but the government carefully sidesteps the issue because there is too much division about it within its own ranks. Again, I don't expect to see much progress on that within the life of this government. But of course the incompetency doesn't stop there. This is a government that resisted a banking royal commission until its own members forced it to act. From memory, the government voted against it about 26 times. Then, when the royal commission report was finally handed to it, the government ignored, deviated from or procrastinated over the recommendations. This is a government that not only mismanaged the implementation of the National Disability Insurance Scheme but then cut $4.6 billion of funding from it so that it could claim a balanced budget. Now it wants everyone on the scheme to undergo an independent reassessment in order to reassess the support packages that people are currently on. That in itself is another cost-cutting measure that I foresee from this government, an example of where the government is looking to make cuts and doing it by appointing an independent assessment process so that the ultimate result will be less funding for each of those packages. But we'll wait and see what the government has to say about that in the weeks and months ahead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that took over the royal commission into child sexual abuse but then ignored the commission's recommendations and, not surprisingly, left victims disappointed with the Redress Scheme. Only this week we saw it again, with calls for a royal commission into veteran suicides. It took a public campaign and a majority of members of this parliament for the government to sit up and listen, just as it took a long public campaign for the Morrison government to grant Teddy Sheean the recognition he rightfully deserved. Again, these are great examples of the public speaking out and speaking out forcefully, to the point where the government has had to backflip. Disappointingly, with respect to the royal commission into veteran suicides, the government was not even prepared to support the motion. The Prime Minister said, 'We simply will not oppose it.' Well, what does that mean? What sort of message does that send to the veterans and their families and loved ones who have been crying out for a royal commission?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We then had the $721 millionâpossibly much more than that, when the final repayments are madeâof the robodebt debacle. Not only was it immoral but it was illegal, and the government knew it was illegal and persisted with it, hoping that it wouldn't be caught out. But in the end it was. Sadly, that debacle hurt people badly, because they had to go through a process of repaying money that they believed they should never have had to repay. The stress it caused many of them is something that this government should be absolutely ashamed of.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also had the $70 million COVID app that no-one used and the Great Barrier Reef Foundation being given $444 million of money that was, again, rightfully criticised by the Auditor-General, as was the $100 million sports rorts, which resulted in Minister McKenzie's resignation. Again the Prime Minister was able to sidestep that issue. He claimed to know nothing about it, claimed that it was something that was outside of his control and that all the applications were above board. But we know it was a rort. It was disclosed as a rort. Quite frankly, the government ought to, again, bury its head in shame for the way it manages public funding, not just because it was a rort in itself but because so many worthy organisations put so much time and effort into preparing submissions and applications which then were not funded.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps the most glaring examples of this government's incompetence are the NBN rolloutâit not only cost an additional $27.5 billion and now has to be rectified at a further cost of several billion dollars, but was also dragged out to the point that people were not getting the services; even today people are not getting the services that they thought they would get once the rollout was completeâand the saga of the replacement submarine contract. We just heard the member for Burt talking about that eloquently and clearly articulating how this government has mismanaged that process from the very start. It's a process which has resulted in a $40 billion blowout of public funds, so we now have the expectation that it will cost $90 billion for the replacement submarines. But we still don't know what we are getting, when we are getting them or how much of the work will be in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After eight years in government, you would have thought that this issue might have been sorted out, but, as the member for Burt quite rightly pointed out just a few moments ago, in Senate estimates this week it was revealed that we still don't have answers to some of those critical questions. Even the question of the 60 per cent local work contractâwhich, I might add, was 90 per cent at the time that the contract was announcedâis absolutely not clear. I now read reports that that might occur with the second, third or fourth submarine that is built, but not necessarily with the first one. That is an example of where we should be building these submarines here in Australia, skilling our own workforce. We have the expertise. We've shown that through the Australian Submarine Corporation at Osborne, and yet we are paying someone from overseas to do work that should be done here. We're not talking about a few million dollars; we're talking about $90 billion, and possibly more by the time all of the details are sorted out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is also the mob that allowed profitable Australian companies to claim billions of dollars from its JobKeeper program, with the executives of some of those companies being paid millions of dollars in bonuses while people were losing their jobs. I understand that 30 of those companies recorded higher profits during the COVID period than they did in the previous years, yet they were getting public funding in order for them to make those higher profits. This is the mobâthat's all I can refer to them asâthat claim that they are good economic managers, a government that pretend that they are acting in the national interest, that pretend that they know how to manage the economy, yet, in reality, have seen not millions but billions of public dollars being wasted or improperly expended.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said from the outset, these two bills allocate $2.6 billion of additional government spending. Gross debt is currently over $800 billion and forecast to reach well over $1 trillion. This year's deficit is forecast to be $197.7 billion, with cumulative deficits over the forward estimates expected to reach $456 billion, or 2Â½ times the debt inherited by the coalition. And we haven't even factored into that the cost of the recent floods that we have seen over the past week. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They are the government who claimed to be good economic managers. The question that needs to be answered is not only when and how the debt is going to be repaid but what we have to show for it. Very little! And in a couple of weeks time, when JobKeeper ends and we have another couple of hundred thousand people on welfare or unemployment benefits, what will the debt blow out to then? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact remains that this government is incompetent. It's a government with no clear economic strategy, but riddled with rorts, pork-barrelling and incompetence. This is a government that, quite frankly, shouldn't be given the opportunity to spend another $2.6 billion without adequate scrutiny. We have always taken the moral view that we will not oppose appropriation bills, and for that reason we will support Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2020-2021 and its cognate bill, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2020-2021. But the reality is that we support them not because we have confidence in this governmentârather the opposite is the caseâbut because it is the right thing to do.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (11<span class="HPS-Time">:06</span>):  In 2019, at the International Women's Day breakfast, the Prime Minister said he wanted to see women rise, but not at the expense of men. Sadly the appropriation bill before us, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2020-2021, reflects this sentiment. It does little to advance or invest in the opportunity, equity and safety of women. In this legislation, the Morrison government had the chance to acknowledge the disproportionate impact that COVID has had on women, and they have chosen not to. Child care, hospitality, aged care, education, travelâthese are all industries that have been left high and dry by this government. All these sectors are important to the wellbeing of families and the productivity of our nation. It is a shame that the government views their funding as a cost rather than an investment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On Sunday JobKeeper is set to end. This will devastate many small businesses and family businesses across my electorate, especially those in the tourism and travel sector. Travel agents employ 40,000 Australians; 30,000 of these employees are women. I have spent much time over the past couple of months with these hardworking women who run many of the travel agencies across my electorate. Without JobKeeper, they have told me they're afraid they will be unable to keep the doors open. Last week I spoke to Greg, who owns a travel agency in Waurn Ponds. He's working four jobs just to keep afloat. He has six staff, and five of those are women. They're all worried they're going to lose their jobs on Monday. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this week I asked the Prime Minister in question time why he would rip the economic support away when we know that the travel agency industry is unlikely to recover until next year at least. The Prime Minister responded that it was all okay, nothing to see here, because the government had done a deal for the airlines to offer half-price flights. Half-price flights will do nothing to help Liz, Lyn, Nicole, Matt, Jess and Kim. The travel agency industry needs JobKeeper to be extended, or at least to have a very targeted support package, and this package should be included in the budget. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The childcare sector has also not fared well under this government. Childcare and early education centres mostly remained open during the pandemic, but child care was the first sector to lose JobKeeper in July last year, leaving many childcare centres around this country running at a loss. While the Morrison government provided some relief to childcare centres throughout my home state of Victoria's lockdown, it wasn't enough. As only 30 per cent of the sector is categorised as full time, it left casual employees ineligible for support payments. With fewer casuals available, other staff are now having to work longer hours and pick up more shifts to fill the shortages. We're staring down the barrel of a crisis in this sector, devaluing the critical work of our childcare workers. I wish I could say I wasn't surprised the Morrison government had chosen not to invest in this sector as a means of boosting the economy, but I guess that is what happens when there is only one female on the coalition's Expenditure Review Committee. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An investment in child care is an investment in women, it's an investment in families and it should be a priority in this budget. Otherwise we'll continue to hear stories like Pawandeep's. Pawandeep is a young woman who lives in Grovedale in my electorate. She desperately wants more work. She wants to work additional days, but the cost of doing so is holding her back. By not addressing the prohibitive costs of child care, this government is holding women back from returning to work. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Aged care is another example of a profession dominated by hardworking women that this government is failing to invest in. Just last week, a 30-strong delegation of nurses and personal-care workers came to Canberra. They'd hoped to meet with key decision-makers across the entire parliament. The delegation was only able to secure one meeting with a government MP. It was a coalition backbencher. The royal commission reflected the great need for investment and for better staffing within the sector. I urge the Morrison government to act on the commissioner's findings, and not leave this to collect dust like the probes that have come before it. What is needed is a plan with teethâa plan underpinned by compassion and by real funding. Our aged-care employees and loved ones in the sector deserve nothing less. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The latest Workplace Gender Equality Agency report shows men take home $25,000 a year, or $242 a week, more than women on average. The surge in casual and part-time work since the peak of the pandemic is only widening this gap. The Centre for Future Work suggests that, if the data were properly measured, the pay gap between all workers would be an alarming 31 per cent. Women's employment dropped almost eight per cent between February and May last year. Compared with January 2020, women's employment is lower by about 53,000 jobs while male employment rose by 7,000 jobs. The pay gap will only increase unless something is done to address the rise in casual, insecure work and childcare costs. If we want women to advance, there must be an investment to make it happen. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:24</span>):  by leaveâI was previously speaking about the completely laissez faire attitude of this government to many of the issues that concern me around health, around disability, around local infrastructure, around jobs and around education. In particular, I was speaking of the rapid increase in gap costs for high-level medical care that's occurring around Australia in areas such as interventional surgery, ophthalmology, ENT surgery and cardiology, where people are having to pay gap costs of several hundred dollars for consultations, including consultations with the cardiologist and neurologist, and, indeed, thousands of dollars above the schedule fee for things like cataract surgery and ENT surgery. The waiting list for cataract surgery in my electorateâand this is for people who are blindâis over two years; yet, if people are prepared to pay $4,000 above the schedule fee, they can have their cataracts done next week. It's a real disgrace. It means that we've got a two-tier health system, which the government has been quite happy to let develop over the last decade. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that life expectancy is markedly different depending on where you live. It's health care by postcode, where outer metropolitan, rural and regional people live 10 or even 15 years less than those who live in the inner cities. There are many reasons for that, but partly it's the development of the two-tier healthcare system, which I think is an absolute tragedy. Australia has had the best public health system in the world, and part of the reason we've done so well during the COVID pandemic compared to many other countries is our public health system. Yet the government has been prepared to let it gradually deteriorate. It's a great tragedy. We must maintain our universal healthcare insurance schemeâMedicareâso that it is fit for purpose for the 21st century. I will be working as hard as I can in this House to make sure that Medicare is strengthened. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue that has been a real tragedy is the lack of any concept from this government of the importance of data in modern health care. In 2016 the government sold off our cervical cancer and breast cancer register to Telstra Health, which was a great tragedy. I will be working as hard as I can to make sure that people are aware of what a problem this will be in 21st century medicine. The government's pathetic attempts to roll out electronic healthcare records are another case in point. We need to invest in data and data collection, because this is the future of health care. The government have failed at every level, and they've failed because they philosophically don't understand the importance of universal health care and the importance of data in this digital age. It is a tragedy that must be reversed if we are going to keep our healthcare system the best in the world. I really wish the government, instead of patting themselves on the back all the time with their piecemeal health announcements, would develop a philosophy that understands universal health care and the importance for our economy of having health for all Australians and health equality for all Australians. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst we describe the NDIS as bipartisan, the government does not understand the importance of the NDIS for, in particular, people who are very disadvantaged. They constantly put roadblocks in the way. They constantly develop add-ons to the system that restrict people's ability to access the NDIS: in particular, the private assessors that the government is insisting on nowâagain, just another layer of bureaucracy, where someone who has very little idea is made to assess people with, sometimes, the most complex medical problems and illnesses, and it just slows the system down and adds another area of complexity to the bureaucracy and denies people adequate care. I deal with some of the most complex genetic disorders that we see in childhood, and many of those people are really struggling to access the NDIS as they should, because of this government's poor concept and understanding of the NDIS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen also, in terms of infrastructure, how this government has failed to understand the importance of major infrastructure projects in all electorates. They fund their own Liberal electorates but they don't fund the most important infrastructure in electorates like mine, which are Labor-voting electorates. We've seen this with the Western Sydney airport rail line: they've committed to the northern part of that rail line, for which no adequate business case has ever been made, and this is in the words of Infrastructure Australia; yet the most rapidly developing areas, to the south of the airport, in my electorate of Macarthur, will not be getting the public transport linkâthe rail lineâeven though a very strong business case can be and has been made for that link. So they're denying people in the rapidly growing areasâmany thousands of peopleâadequate transport links to Western Sydney airport and, indeed, to the rest of Sydney.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite just have failed to understand, in any underlying philosophy, the importance of this: that they are there to govern for all Australians, not just their mates. We've seen the rorts that have happened with the land releases around Western Sydney airport, we've seen the sports rorts and the infrastructure rorts, we've seen the council grant rortsâwe've seen a whole range of rorts from the Liberal governments, without any underlying concept of the importance of governing for all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In housing, we've seen people on even moderate incomes excluded from getting into the housing market, because of the government's poor understanding of the need for social and affordable housing. We've seen wealthy Australians flocking to auctions and buying property after property; yet, at the same time, we're seeing young working families not being able to provide a roof over their own heads. Companies are recording record profitsâmany of them being paid JobKeeper, in spite of profits at record levelsâand refusing to pay back their JobKeeper allowances. We're a rich country but we're not an equitable one, and this government is making it worse. We can do so much better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to the pandemic, our economy was lagging, wages growth was stagnant and people were struggling to keep up with the rising cost of living. As I say, my good friend the member for Rankin remarked in an address at the National Press Club that we shouldn't want to get back to the standard we had before the pandemic; we want a better standard for all. Those opposite have demonstrated, through their handling of the crisis, that they have no interest in an equitable society. The coalition is content with the increasing gap between the rich and the poor. They're content with billionaires pocketing taxpayers' money whilst hardworking mums and dads and local businesses are left wanting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, the end of the JobKeeper allowance is going to be an absolute tragedy for many of the small businesses in my electorate, and many of them have contacted me saying they will not be able to continue on without some form of support. These are people in the entertainment industry, people in the hospitality industry, people in tourismâin the many small businesses that are the lifeblood of my electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government, through all of their economic prowessâso they sayâare still amassing trillions of dollars of debt, and Australians are asking why the rich companies and rich people are doing well but they are struggling. Macarthur residents are not seeing any tangible improvements in their standard of living, and the fear is that for generations they and their children will be paying off the massive debt that the government have accrued. People in my electorate are doing it tough, and, with all of this government debt and the mismanagement, I believe, of taxpayer funds, Macarthur residents know that the coalition government are not in their corner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a lot of spin in what the government say. With respect to health, they like to announce new drugs are being released. They forget that the PBS is bipartisan; it doesn't have a political aspect. Those releases would happen no matter what government was in power. Healthcare costs are spiralling out of control. Housing costs are spiralling out of control. People have to pay so much for transport through increasing tolls on roads and increasing public transport costs. What do the government do? They want to bring in a restrictive industrial relations framework. Thankfully, they didn't get most of what they wanted through, because that would have put even more pressure on working families, but that is the philosophy of the government: punish the poor and let the wealthy proceed on their course. A leopard doesn't change its spots. This government is getting more and more conservative as time goes on. We have a coalition government that is gearing up to put industrial relations pressure on working people and let the wealthy do what they want.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyday working people are really struggling in spite of record company profits. With the dividend imputation system the way it is, many wealthy people are profiting, yet working-class families barely have enough to put a roof over their head and food on the table. Those opposite come into this place and talk about our 'recovery' and our 'comeback', but for many people their quality of life will not improve unless something drastic is done to help them, not the wealthy. It's not a recovery if you're robbing entire communities of economic opportunity and jobs; if you're pork-barrelling money into projects that have no business case and are of no benefit to the average person. Unfortunately, those opposite, whilst they are ideologically divided, have demonstrated their true nature in what they want to do with industrial relations and what they want to do with health care and educationâwhat they want to do with taxpayers' money. We know that those without stable work have been less able to get work. We know that those who are working multiple jobs feel increasing pressure. We know that many young families struggle to put a roof over their head. These bills, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2020-2021 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2020-2021, are all spin and no substance. There's no adequate philosophy in this government. I thank the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:37</span>):  What a privilege it was to be here for the contribution of my friend the member for Macarthur, who brought to bear his life experience, passion and understanding in his consideration of these measures and the context in which they are situated. In my remarks on these two bills, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2020-2021 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2020-2021, I want to set them out in their context as well as dealing with those measures that largely relate to the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. They are measures that require some comment because the budget, obviously, is the way in which Australia's government expresses its values, our values and our concerns. But there are other matters which we should be considering, as well as the measures contained in these billsâand, frankly, the measures that would have been contained in these bills had we a government as good as the Australian people; a government on the side of Australians, particularly working-class Australians and vulnerable people, the people we work hardest to represent in this place, as you well know, Madam Deputy Speaker Vamvakinou.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very conscious, as I stand here, that on 1 April, in just a couple of days time, huge changes will comeâhuge changes to the disbenefit of hundreds of thousands of Australians. Changes to income support will, in many cases, rip people away from employment and deny them the opportunity to maintain a dignified standard of living. In the other place right now, questions are being asked about the real-life impact of these changes, this ill-considered withdrawal of support. Lots of good questions have been asked; few satisfactory answers have been given. It seems that officials can't answer questions about the impact of significant changes, such as that to the partner income test. When we see what has happened in all of our electorates, we see the difference that the addition of the supplement has made to people and families. It is quite extraordinary that the impact, particularly on children who have been supported, which is enormous, has not been properly attended to by this government. It is one more shameful indictment in a series of shameful indictments on the part of this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted to touch on that because what's going to happen on 1 April will have an extraordinary impact on the communities we all represent. There will be an extraordinary impact also on us as a nation, as a people. We've seen Australians at their best through the pandemic and, from time to time, even this government has come to support them, generally when it's exhausted all other options. The strength that we've seen, our compact that binds us to each other, has been undermined by a government which doesn't recognise that now is not the time to rip away fundamental supports. Now is not the time to remove people from a connection to work, which is so fundamentally important, particularly when we see the disaster that has been the JobMaker program and particularly when we see the absence of any meaningful plan for reconstruction that's built around having secure work. I hope government members, including the member for Braddon, who is here and who I know is a decent person, can talk to colleagues about the impact of these changes and seek to persuade them that now is not the time to take away these precious supports that have secured people dignity. They can't be ripped away right now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this building today and over the past few weeks, we've had to think about a broader context: how unequal our society is and what we might do about it. Last year, 2020, didn't only bring us the experience of a pandemic; it presented a reckoning around the world on race, with the Black Lives Matter movementâa movement that energised and captured the anger and frustration of so many in the United States, in the UK and, of course, here, as we grappled with so many aspects of injustice, particularly impacting First Nations Australians, 30 years on from the royal commission into deaths in custody. I understand that today there is more tragic news on that front, taking the number of Indigenous deaths in custody since the royal commission to well over 400. The reckoning on race, about who we are as a people, is something that we are yet to grapple with effectively. The government is failing to grapple with its dismissive attitude to the Statement from the Heartâa generous offer by First Nations people for the rest of us to walk with them to reconciliation and a shared equal future. And there is the failure to do the right thing in recognising the other half of the modern Australian story, our immigration story, with the cruel rhetoric and cruel decisions, cutting people off from income support and, frankly, treating people appallingly with the rhetoric of going homeâpeople who couldn't go home and should not be told to go home. This again rips apart our social fabric, with racism on the rise, with anti-Semitism on the rise and with Islamophobia on the rise. We need clear leadershipâleadership in words and leadership in deeds from our government. This has been lacking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge that there have been statements from members of the government and the Prime Minister condemning racism, but they fall far short of what is required, which is a strategy founded on first principles, on our values of treating everyone equally, ensuring that every aspect of our society is equally open to everyone, regardless of their background and regardless of their faith. That is informed by listening, but we have a Prime Minister who doesn't listen. He demonstrates that every time he presents himself as having listened, with every one of his resets that we have seen. Of course none of us can escape the other reckoning that we're going through, which is the reckoning on women's rights, on how women are treated in our society and, most pointedly for all of us in this place, how they are treated in this building. This place, which should be an exemplar to our society, has in fact proved to be the reverse, where the most fundamental acts of decency seem to be beyond this government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't expect members opposite to share my sense of how the world should be or the policy decisions a government should make, but surely it should not be too much to ask for basic decency in how people are treated, particularly people who have been through the most unimaginable circumstances. Yet that is what we see: a failure to listen; a failure to listen to those voices that were so extraordinarily powerful in the March 4 Justice. All of us in this place have privileges, but to stand out the front of the parliament just over a week ago and feel the anger being turned into an energy for change was something that I was struck by and continue to be struck by. I'm struck by it every day in the conversations I have, both when I feel the pain that has been triggered in so many of my friends and colleagues, and in the conversations I have in the electorate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People are looking for leadership. They're looking for unequivocal leadership and a government that is on the side of Australian women, a government which does not just say it listens but demonstrates that it is engaged in dialogue across the community to deliver a society in which everyone can participate equally. That's got to start with having a parliament in which everyone can participate equally: members, the representatives in the other place, the staff and everyone who works in this building, such as the journalists, the cleaners and the attendants. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an incredibly difficult time. I don't presume to know how difficult for many, but I think we all know that. We have all seen the pain. The question for those of us in this place is: what will we do with that knowledge? What will we do with our understanding of what has gone wrong? We cannot be silent. We must send signals that this building is the exemplar to the Australian community that it must be. We can't refuse to answer critical questions that go to character. They go to the character of the Prime Minister. They go to the character of his government. They go to our character as a nation. Ms Higgins deserves so much more than that, but how can she be denied that? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is something that I find extraordinary: the absence of any sense of responsibility. We speak about this often in relation to this government. We have a Prime Minister who had ambitions for the highest office in the land that aren't matched by his ambition for the people he should be serving. At every level we see that in this government. The paucity of vision contained in the legislation we're debating now is one illustration of that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I, with all of my colleagues, am up for a debate about our alternative vision for Australia, the policies that we think can secure a recovery, the policies that we think can give every Australian a reasonable shot at a decent life, a secure job, a roof over their head, education for their children, access to early learning and child careâall of these things. That's the debate that we're up for, but we can't really have that debate until the issue that's clouding this building is resolved and until the Prime Minister and perhaps those around him accept their responsibility to do so, their responsibility to Ms Higgins and their responsibility to every person who works or has worked in this building to secure a system of work, a place of work, that is safe, where people can articulate their concerns without fear of reprisals, without fear of having their name or their loved ones' names traduced in the mediaâto be treated with respect, and, when they raise serious issues, as Ms Higgins did out the front of parliament in such powerful and courageous terms, for the Prime Minister not to dissemble and deflect. Thirteen times the member for Ballarat has asked him what steps he has taken to look into this allegation. She's asked no more than that, no more than for him to look into the very, very serious allegation, concerning integrity and decency, that has been made against people who work for the Prime Minister. And, here we are, none the wiser, because there will be no effort made to look into this. We're not seeing progress, let alone justice. We're not seeing an acknowledgement that there is justice to be pursued. That is so far from good enough for Ms Higgins, for all of us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I just hope that, when we return at two o'clock to hold the government to account, the government will respect that process, for once, and the Prime Minister will address his remarks through us, through the Speaker, to the Australian people, to show finally, through all the presentations that are supposed to be resets, dressed up as mea culpas, that we will actually see a reset, that we will actually a mea culpa, not a shuffling of the deckchairs, which seems to be the answer. This isn't about the politics of every day. This isn't about managing the media cycle. They are the hallmarks of this governmentâI get thatâand that probably won't change, but this is a fundamental question. This is a time of reckoning that is beyond these issues that make up our ordinary political conversation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Trust in government has actually gone up. Trust in the institutions that shape the lives of Australians has gone up. But it will disappear very, very quickly if action isn't taken. Anyone who comes to this place, from whatever perspective, is surely here to do good. We can only do that if the Australian people will give us that licence. Fundamental to that licence is having national leadership that will stand up for what is fundamentally right, that will treat people with respect, that will recognise that we are at a point of reckoning on gender and, frankly, that this parliament has let Australian woman down.</span>

It's been an extraordinary 12 months. During the COVID-19 pandemic, time has taken on a very strange quality. For those of us who, for more than 100 days in the last 12 months, were engaged in the homeschooling of primary-school-age children, it sometimes felt that time had stopped passing altogether, as the days, the weeks and the months melded into one. In other aspects of our lives, it was like time had gone into fast-forward. In the technology space, we've seen a decade's worth of adoption of new technologies in just 12 months as we've learned how to work remotely and to consume services like health and education via telecommunication services. We've seen a similar pattern in international relations, where the tensions and pressures of the COVID-19 pandemic seem to have brought on a decade's worth of worsening strategic tensions in just 12 months.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my portfolio of cybersecurity, we've seen these trends come together in one. In 2021 we've already seen some of the most significant cybersecurity incidents on record. Each of these incidents has raised significant issues for the nation and the Morrison government. First, the security firm FireEye identified the SUNBURST backdoor within the SolarWinds Orion IT monitoring software, a vulnerability that formed part of the most successful supply chain attack in history, an attack that could have compromised 18,000 users of SolarWinds software and that the US government believes hackers backed by the Russian government did in fact use to gain access to targets as significant as the US departments of treasury, state, homeland security and energy and the National Institutes of Health and the National Nuclear Security Administration.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The president of Microsoft, Brad Smith, described that as the 'largest and most sophisticated attack' ever. We're yet to hear anything from the Morrison government about this incident. There seem to be two ways that they could view this incident. Some analysts view it as simply a particularly successful form of cyberespionage by one government against another, long regarded as accepted under emerging cybernorms. Others argue that the supply chain aspect of this attack gives it a different character. The report of the 2015 UN Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security provides a recommendation about normal state behaviour in cyberspace, saying: </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">States should take reasonable steps to ensure the integrity of the supply chain so that end users can have confidence in the security of ICT products. States should seek to prevent the proliferation of malicious ICT tools and techniques and the use of harmful hidden functions â¦</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Does the Australian government believe that there is a norm for state behaviour in cyberspace that prohibits supply chain attacks, even for purposes that would be acceptable under existing norms? We don't know; we haven't heard from them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anne Neuberger, US Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology, has described the SolarWinds attack as 'more than a single incident of espionage; it's fundamentally a concern for the ability for this to become disruptive'. Does the Australian government believe that supply chain attacks have the potential to be disruptive in the way described by Ms Neuberger? We don't know; we haven't heard from them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Hot on the heels of SolarWinds, on 5 January, Taiwanese researcher Cheng-Da Tsai identified a series of new vulnerabilities in locally hosted instances of the Microsoft Exchange Server software. Microsoft assessed the vulnerability and attributed the attack to state based hackers. At this point I should note for the record that as an opposition spokesman I have neither the access nor the expertise to make an attribution assessment of this attack, but Microsoft has, and Microsoft developed a patch for these vulnerabilities and, on 3 March, issued an alert about the threat. That alert made it clear that 'even though we've worked quickly to deploy an update for the Hafnium exploits, we know that many nation-state actors and criminal groups will move quickly to take advantage of any unpatched systems '. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The operators of unpatched Microsoft Exchange Servers were highly vulnerable, not just to this state backed espionage but also to follow-on ransomware attacks by cybercriminals. Getting the word out to as many potentially vulnerable organisations as possible about this threat was urgent. But, in the subsequent days, researchers estimated that more than 100,000 servers around the world could have been compromised by these hackers. It was an urgent issue. Hackers used automated scanning tools to identify vulnerable systems and then installed unauthenticated web shells on the servers to enable easy subsequent access. The issue was so significant that, on 6 March, US President Biden's press secretary, Jen Psaki, said at the White House press briefing:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ this is a significant vulnerability that could have far-reaching impacts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She said that network owners also needed to consider whether they had already been compromised and should immediately take appropriate steps. Former Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency director Chris Krebs warned operators of vulnerable servers that they should assume compromise. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By 9 March, six days after Microsoft issued its first alert, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> was reporting that 7,000 servers in Australia were vulnerable. But, while the ACSC had been issuing alerts to ACSC partners, and those who closely monitored its website during this time saw the alert, we heard nothing from members of the Morrison government about this allegedly state sponsored attack. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 19 June last year, the Prime Minister and the defence minister held a high-profile press conference about the threat to the nation posed by the exploitation of the copy-paste vulnerability. Yet we didn't see the same response from the Prime Minister or the defence minister to this, objectively, even more serious cybersecurity threat. If ever there was a cybersecurity incident that demanded the Prime Minister mount the bully pulpit and get the word out about the urgent need for organisations to protect themselves, it was this one. In Microsoft's alert about this vulnerability, it claimed that the state sponsored actor that was exploiting this vulnerability primarily targets, among other things, infectious disease researchers, law firms, higher education institutions, defence contractors, policy think tanks and NGOs. Many of these organisations won't be ACSC partners and they won't be hitting 'refresh' on the ACSC cyberalerts page. Political leadership was needed to get the word out to these entities as soon as possible, but the PM and the defence minister were silent. Why? The Morrison government had been engulfed by its own sleaze and scandals and distracted from this important national security issue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the time the Microsoft exchange vulnerability was going public, the defence minister was on leave. The acting defence minister, who is also the Minister for Women, was in hiding from the media. The Assistant Defence Minister, the member of the executive to whom the Morrison government intended to give responsibility for the ACSC and cybersecurity more broadly, still hadn't received his charter letter setting out his responsibilities, three months after his appointment. We didn't see any form of statement from any member of the Morrison government about this Exchange server vulnerability until 10 March, a week after these vulnerabilities were disclosed, when the assistant defence minister issued a press release, a press release simply urging people to patch their systems and follow technical adviceâtoo late.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other Morrison government minister we haven't heard from on this is the home affairs minister. Who could forget the tough talk we heard from the minister in October 2019? He gave a press release in October 2019 where he said, with much chest-beating machismo, that the Australian government 'won't allow our government bodies or our non-government bodies to be hacked into' and that it will 'call out cyberattacks on the nation'. Despite the macho rhetoric, the minister is now nowhere to be seen. He's too busy backgrounding the media that he will be the new defence minister. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To add insult to injury, we now read that the Minister for Government Services is in line to become the new home affairs minister, with responsibility for cybersecurity policy, in the upcoming reshuffle. After eight long years of scandal and sleaze have decimated the coalition frontbench, this is what we are left with: the minister for 'my bad' and fictitious DDoS attacks, the member for $40,000 home internet bills and the master of disaster leading Australia's national security. Members of the Morrison government are so obsessed with themselvesâwith their own scandals and their own promotion prospectsâthat they've taken their eye off the ball on an important matter of national security. These incidents demanded more than simply technical advisories from government and warnings that organisations needed to patch their systems. Under another government, we would have seen a ministerial statement on these incidents outlining how the Australian government saw the very serious issues they raised. Given the scale of this attack and the potential state-actor element, we need to hear from the government about whether they believe this behaviour accords with international law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Dmitri Alperovitch, the co-founder and former CTO of the highly respected cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, has stated that the state sponsored dimension of these Exchange server attacks is 'a major norms violation', because: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While it started out as targeted espionage campaign, they engaged in reckless and dangerous behavior by scanning/compromising Exchange servers across the entire IPv4 address space with webshells that can now be used by other actors, including ransomware crews â¦</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to know if the Australian government shares the view that these attacks are a violation of the expected international norms of appropriate behaviour by states in cyberspace. Alperovitch has further stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This in my view deserves a significant response by the Biden Administration, especially if we start seeing, as expected, damaging ransomware attacks against American companies â¦ </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 9 March 2021, the day before the assistant minister's media release, Alperovitch further noted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Because this campaign is still ongoing â¦ webshells on tens of thousands of networks - the response must demand immediate shutdown of those implants to limit damage, not just signal our displeasure with the fact that it had occured. Needs to happen NOW â¦</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet we've heard nothing from the Morrison government on attribution of this attackânot then, and not now. There's nothing on how it intends to respond, nothing on whether it is working with Five Eyes allies to craft a response to this incident and nothing on whether it's made direct representations to any other government about this conduct. In one sense, this is appropriate, because we've heard nothing from the government about the way it thinks about international cybernorms for quite some time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, the Morrison government began consultations on its cyber and critical technology international engagement strategy on 22 April 2020. Public submissions on the strategy closed on 16 June 2020. It's been 11 months since the government began public consultations on this strategy and nine months since public submissions on the consultations closed, but the strategy still hasn't been released. A DFAT disclosure on GrantConnect from June 2020 states that the public-facing strategy is scheduled to be released in late 2020. We're now three months after late 2020, and the strategy still hasn't been released.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The foreign affairs minister announced the establishment of the Quad Tech Network on 23 December 2020 to 'strengthen global discussion of cyber and critical technology'. It's a great initiative, but it sounds like the kind of initiative that would have been heavily informed by the government's intended approach in its as yet unreleased cyber and critical technology international engagement strategy. But, bizarrely, that strategy isn't even mentioned in the minister's press release announcing the Quad Tech Network. You'd think that it would have made more sense to finalise the overarching strategy before implementing specific agreements in this exact area, especially considering that the overarching strategy was originally scheduled for finalisation and publication before the Quad Tech Network.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is going on inside the Morrison government on cybersecurity policy? After eight long years of the coalition government, responsibility for cybersecurity policy inside this government is a complete mess. It's not led from the top. There's no political leadership. It progresses solely as a function of who inside the government is most adept at bureaucratic knife fights. Australians deserve better in this important area of public policy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has sought to be a constructive opposition in cybersecurity policy. We have sought to help the government on this important area of national interest. We have released discussion papers on national cyberresilience, examining the lessons we could learn from the systemic risks present in the cybersecurity sector from the challenges we faced in the COVID-19 pandemic. We've released a national ransomware strategy trying to develop a dedicated strategy to combat the most serious cybersecurity threat confronting Australian businesses, as identified by the Australian Cyber Security Centre. I'm pleased to see that the government has adopted many of the elements of the active cyberdefence strategy that Labor advocated in our national cyberresilience paper, and I'm pleased that Labor's national ransomware strategy discussion paper was followed soon after by a paper on ransomware by the government's Cyber Security Strategy Industry Advisory Panel. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has sought to constructively hold the government accountable for its compliance with the cybersecurity requirements of the Protective Security Policy Framework. I'm pleased that the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit issued a bipartisan report late last year on Commonwealth cyberresilience that highlighted the concerns of both members of that committee and the Australian National Audit Office with the continuing failure of the vast majority of Commonwealth entities to implement the ASD's top four cybersecurity mitigations nearly eight years after they became mandatory. Only 24 per cent of Commonwealth entities audited by the ANAO since 2014 have been found to be compliant with the ASD's top fourth mitigations. These are the most fundamental cybersecurity mitigations that can be implemented by an organisation to protect them against cybersecurity threats, and unfortunately noncompliance with these mandatory standards remains endemic. The ANAO continues to hold audits into this issue. The JCPAA continues to hold inquiries into these audits. It's time that the government did better. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor in opposition is playing its part in cybersecurity policy, and it's time that the Morrison government did so too. I welcome this government's decision to assign the Assistant Minister for Defence responsibility for these matters. He will provide much-needed political leadership in this space and I wish him well in this endeavour. I simply hope, though, that the upcoming broader ministerial reshuffle will result in cybersecurity getting the political leadership that it needs at the highest level of the Morrison government and that has been so sorely lacking since the Prime Minister ascended to his role in 2018.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (12<span class="HPS-Time">:07</span>):  I speak today on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2020-21 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2020-21, bills concerned with the funding of the business of government. When it comes to business, I know that the past 12 months have been very hard for businesses in my electorate of Moreton and also for individuals. The JobKeeper wage subsidy scheme has been the lifeline that kept many businesses afloat, but in just three short days JobKeeper will end. This lifeline will be pulled away, ripped away, from 2,480 businesses in Moreton, businesses that are relying on this lifeline. It will no longer be there for the more than 7,600 workers in Moreton who only kept their jobs because of this taxpayer-provided wage subsidy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Treasury estimates that up to 150,000 Australians will lose their jobs. It could be worse than that: other economists are actually expecting that figure of job losses to be closer to 250,000 people who'll be joining the jobless queue. That's 250,000 devastated households. While the Prime Minister and Treasurer talk in marketing slogans like 'Australia's fightback', 'Australia's comeback' and 'Australia's recovery'âfocus group tested slogansâmy businesses are just trying to stay afloat to keep their employees on the books and to keep supporting these families. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The pandemic isn't over. The Morrison government has only rolled out 10 per cent of the four million vaccinations it promised to deliver before the end of the month. Today is 25 Marchâa significant day for Greek Australians, I thinkâbut only 10 per cent of vaccinations have been rolled out, and the government is ripping away 100 per cent of JobKeeper from the economy. Many businesses don't know how they'll continue to survive once JobKeeper ends in a few days. How many employers will have to be let go because employees just can't afford to pay their wages while the economy is still slowly rebounding, or taking a new shape? There are already two million Australians looking for work. That is already an incredibly long queue. The government is cutting JobKeeper wage subsidy support in just a few days and businesses are going to be left to sink or swim without any ongoing support. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's too soon for this support to be cut while the government is actually breaking its vaccination rollout promise. Remember when the Prime Minister promised us that we were at the front of the queue? That wasn't the truth. Of course, the Prime Minister's fineâhe's had the jabâbut there are still 24,800,000 or so Australians who are still waiting to be vaccinated. The Prime Minister is keeping our international borders closed, and I understand the health reasons for doing so, and that he might continue to do so for some time, but there are many sectors that rely on international tourists and international students, and they're going to be struggling for some time yet. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly mention ELICOS, and I will come back to that later, because there are some important developments taking place in the ELICOS sector. There are also international students at universities and, obviously, tourism, particularly in North Queensland. How will these businesses survive and what are the consequences if they don't? ELICOS is a classic example where these people with their incredible skills will, if they're not supported, go to other sectors, and the pipeline that we have for international students going into universities will be cut off. What will happen when these sectors try to spring back to life when the international tourists and the international students are able to return? The businesses need to be supported, but they won't be around. That will be a disaster. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What's even more astonishing about the coalition government cutting JobKeeper support to these businesses too early is that they have wasted so much money by supporting businesses that don't actually need taxpayer support. A report has found that one-fifth of the JobKeeper wage subsidy paid to ASX 300 firms went to entities that reported an increase in their underlying earnings metrics from pre-pandemic levels. That's for one in five. For robodebt, the government was happy to go after people who were doing it tough. We don't have the data on overall JobKeeper payments, but if the same is true for businesses outside ASX 300 firms then it would follow that, in the second half of 2020, almost $10 billion of JobKeeperâthat's taxpayer fundsâwent to firms whose profits rose. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember robodebt. People in the opposition remember robodebt and the harm that occurred. What about Rolex debt? What about Harvey Norman and the like who are taking all this money? We know what JobKeeper was for: it was for Australian taxpayers to help businesses who were suffering financially. It was to keep workers in jobs until our world returned to a new kind of normal. Labor pushed for wage subsidies very early, and I think the member for Gorton was part of that right from the start. We were told that pushing for wage subsidies wasn't appropriate, but Labor knew it was the right thing to do. This support needed to be targeted appropriately, so that those who needed the support got it. We didn't need a sports-rorts-on-steroids type of assistance program. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the Morrison government had been more competent in their rollout of the JobKeeper wage subsidy, they would not have wasted money that could be used to extend the subsidy for businesses that still need it right now. It could have been used to extend the subsidy for the 1.1 million people currently receiving the subsidy for another six months. So we have 10 per cent of the vaccine rollout, but a 100 per cent cut to the assistance. This would make all the difference to businesses in Moreton and all around the Australia and to the workers who are employed there; it would keep them connected to their workplaces. In six months, hopefully, we'll be much closer to recommencing international travel and again welcoming tourists and studentsâhopefully. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather than the money being misdirected to businesses that did not need it, it could have been originally included for sectors that missed out, like, dare I say, the arts sector or, particularly, the university sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It really upsets me and people in Moreton that this Rolex debt will not be paid by these businesses. We've seen companies like Solomon Lew's Premier Investments receive $40 million of taxpayer assistance through JobKeeper. They were forced to temporarily shut some of their stores, like Smiggle, Dotti, Portmans and Just Jeans, when the pandemic struck, but, when the stores reopened and online sales boomed, Lew's business also boomed. Premier Investments made a bigger profit in 2020 than it made in 2019. Shareholders were paid, in total, $57 million in dividends. Solomon Lew personally received more than $20 million and the CEO received a $2.5 million taxpayer funded bonus. The shares in Premier Investments have dramatically increased to a record high. It's always good to see Australian businesses doing well and making profits. I applaud that. It does mean more jobs. But it begs the question: how carefully designed was the JobKeeper wage subsidy? And, more importantly, should Solomon Lew pay the taxpayer money back? I particularly commend the member for Fenner, Andrew Leigh, on the great work he's doing in this area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government are all for social security recipients having income management, but, for corporate welfare, they're happy to let the boardroom dish out multimillion-dollar taxpayer funded bonuses. They flaunt their taxpayer funded Rolex watches while trumpeting the fact that they go after people with a robodebt farce. There is unfortunately no legal obligation today for Solomon Lew to return the JobKeeper subsidies and there seems to be no inclination by the coalitionâno word from the backbench and no word from those in the executiveâto get businesses to return the JobKeeper subsidies. There seems to be no inclination to pursue those who made windfall profits from the taxpayers' purse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I should highlight the companies that do have a social conscience and benefited from JobKeeper but bounced back stronger and have paid back the taxpayer subsidies. I will mention just a few of them. Toyota Australia returned $18 million in JobKeeper payments and said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">... returning JobKeeper payments was the right thing to do as a responsible corporate citizen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Super Retail Group, which owns Rebel and BCF, announced it would repay $1.7 million in JobKeeper subsidies as its stores have returned a healthy profit. So there were Toyota and Super Retail Group. It sounds like: 'Oh, what a BCF-ing good feeling it is to be a corporate citizen!' It is corporate responsibility being acted out tangibly. Well done, Toyota, Rebel and BCF. JobKeeper should have helped battlers who need the help, not billionaires who don't. This Rolex debt should be repaid. In 2020, the combined wealth of Australia's billionaires jumped by a jaw-dropping 52 per cent. They don't need valuable taxpayer dollars to prop them up, and we shouldn't have to rely on billionaires having a conscience to ensure that taxpayers' money is spent wisely.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister and the Treasurer should have ensured that the funds were better targeted to those who really needed it. They should clean up their own mess. But this coalition government just seems to roll from one mess to another. Whether it's their complete lack of integrity or sheer incompetence, it has become difficult to keep up with the daily scandals. In their eighth year in office, here are just a few in the long trail of scandals that have defined this coalition government. They paid 10 times too much to a Liberal Party donor for a piece of land alongside the new Sydney airport, the Leppington Triangle. A federal judge said a government minister had engaged in criminal conduct by unlawfully depriving an asylum seeker of his liberty. The coalition government oversaw a scheme where Services Australia illegally issued debt collection notices to more than 370,000 Australians, and more than 2,000 people died, some from suicide, despite the government being warned beforehand that it was illegal. The member for New England paid $80 million for water rights in the Murray-Darling Basin, a quarter more than the seller even asked for. An unheard-of company with its head office in a shack on Kangaroo Island was awarded a $423 million contract to run refugee camps on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea under a limited tenure. This was the only company invited to bid. The Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction sought meetings with senior environment officials about an ongoing investigation by the department into grasslands part owned by the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction. We saw the Minister for Home Affairs personally intervene to have two au pairs, who were about to be deported, released from immigration detention after he was contacted by a former colleague. We saw the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction use a fraudulent documentâand he's never actually explained how he got that fraudulent documentâin an attempt to tarnish the reputation of a local government official, the Sydney Lord Mayor. A minister of the Crown, a minister of the Commonwealth, did this petty deed. I really can't understand that. And who could forget the sports rorts saga, when changes were made to the list of sport grant recipients? Local sporting groups had put time and energy into putting in submissions, but changes were made by the minister, in consultation with the Prime Minister's office, after the government entered the caretaker period. Sport Australia had no knowledge of six of the grants and no application form in front of them. That's just some of the greatest hits. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent months we've seen some awful revelations about allegations of criminal conduct and other disgusting behaviour of coalition staff in this buildingâa building that should be all about noble intentions rather than the grubby behaviour that we've been hearing about in the last few weeks. Most people come to this parliament to do good things, and those good efforts are being besmirched by those opposite. It has revealed a deeply harmful culture about the treatment of women. What has been the response of the Prime Minister and his government? Basically, it's been weasel words and a total avoidance of accountability. It's all about tricky political management and putting out press releases. That is not leadership. It does not even come close. This coalition government has let our nation down, and it is time to throw this lot out.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gorton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:20</span>):  While there are so many things I'd like to respond to in relation to the appropriation billsâthere are so many things that are deficient in the government's performance with respect to a whole series of issues in and outside of my portfolioâthe one thing I'd like to touch upon, which was just mentioned, is the absolute disregard for the importance of maintaining the efficacy and equity in the largest employment subsidy program we have seen. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's true to say that the government finally got around to introducing JobKeeper. But when I asked the Prime Minister in question time whether they would have a wage subsidy his answer was that there was no need. Fortunately they reconvened the parliament and introduced JobKeeper. But we did not expect, many months on, to see that programâbillions of taxpayers' moneyâbeing used to enrich the very, very rich friends of the government. We did not expect to see corporate executive bonuses being paid in companies that were in receipt of JobKeeper. Quite frankly, that is outrageous, and it is incumbent on those companies to do what other good companies have done and pay back taxpayers' money to the Commonwealth rather than game the system so that they can pay bonuses to corporate executives. That was not the intention of the wage subsidy. The wage subsidy was to look after workers and to look after businesses that were struggling as a result of the restrictions imposed upon them quite rightly for health reasons. Therefore, we need to see those companies do the right thing and pay back that money. As the Labor leader said recently, this government is weak on the strong and strong on the weak. We only need to compare the government's approach to JobKeeper being used for bonuses by companies in this country with the way in which they went about robodebt, where they attacked the vulnerable and threatened them with jail, many times completely erroneously. They have never really apologised for that absolutely outrageous behaviour by the federal government. We want to see better from the government in relation to dealing with people who are seeking to game the system in order to use and misuse taxpayers' money. That needs to be done as a matter of urgency. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to my own portfolio, I have to say that it is replete with problems, mistakes and dereliction by this government. We have seen blowouts in contracts. We have seen blowouts in expenditure. We have seen a failure to ensure that our defence industries are getting sufficient parts of the largest contract that the Commonwealth has entered into in our history. For example, we have a situation where this government went to the last election promising that the Future Submarine Program would have 60 per cent local content. From that commitment it's fair to assume that local businesses, small, medium and large, would have felt that they would have had a great chance of securing a lot of business out of the biggest contract the Commonwealth has entered into in relation to this matter. Nearly $90 billion will be spent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what we found after the election was there were no enforceable provisions in the contracts to compel the government to ensure that the prime contractor, Naval Group, provided that work to local businesses in this country. So we have a promise by the government, an announcement by the government, but no deliveryâan announcement before the election, an undertaking to the Australian people; and yet after the election we find there is no enforceable provision inside that contract to compel Naval Group to provide work and business to our defence industry. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have now seen, as a result of that deficiency, is them seeking to retrofit the contract. What they have suggested is that they have secured that commitment now. But what we saw, what was revealed in Senate estimates yesterday, was that the government has, firstly, despite its promises, not seen the provisions of the contract that have been inserted, apparently, into that contract. What was revealed at Senate estimates yesterday is that not one minister has actually seen the words that were apparently included to ensure that local businesses secured sufficient work and were able to grow as a result of that. Nothing has been forthcoming. There is no accountability, no transparency, and now we find that not one ministerânot the Minister for Defence, not the Minister for Defence Industry, not the acting defence ministerâhas actually seen the words that were apparently added to that contract. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why should we believe this government when it comes to this matter, given the failures we have seen in the past? Why should defence industry in this country invest in this area without it being fully transparent that there is sufficient work for them? It's incumbent on the government to explain exactly what is happening with respect to this contract. Not only has nobody in the cabinet seen the words that are supposed to be now included in this contract with the very, very large French prime contractor, but also there is no way for us to understand whether that content, even if it is in the contract, will secure the commitment of at least 60 per cent for local businesses. The problem we have with that is that that promise is hollow if we're not sure about the terms of that contract. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no accountability, no transparency, no confidence in the government in relation to this matter. That is a real, real problem. We don't know if Australian industry content is on the right trajectory until the third or fourth submarine due in the mid-2030s. So we will not even know, unless there's more accountability by this government, for 15 years. It will take us 15 years to be assured of whether that's a commitment. That is not sufficient. You cannot rely on that as a result of the government's very hollow promise. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem with the government is it made commitments even though it didn't secure the provisions. There's been no focus by the government on its job. These matters should have been resolved, determined, at the beginning. When you enter into a contract they should be secured, and it should be fully understood so that the defence industry know that they will be part of the supply chain and part of this contract in a proper way. But that hasn't been done, and this attempt to fit it retrospectively is very, very dodgy. It's very, very unclear and, indeed, we don't know the details. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, apparently there are penalties if Naval Group do not provide local content as agreed, but we don't know the quantum of the penalties. So we don't know whether the prime contractor will say, 'We'll just build the penalties into the costs and not provide that local content.' If the penalties are not high enough to ensure that Naval Group provide local businesses the work, then why will they necessarily engage with local businesses? If the penalties are negligible and not going to deter them from acting in contravention of the terms of the contract, then how can we be assured that local businesses will be in receipt of that work? Well, we cannot be assured, and the government have not given us any reason to believe that they have fixed this problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a Minister for Defence who, of course, is absent, and that's for medical reasons. We have rumours abounding that the defence minister is about to lose her job to the Minister for Home Affairs. We have an acting defence minister who has not understood or fully followed the current problems. We have a government that are completely unable to focus on the biggest expenditure, when it comes to contracts, in this nation's history. They must do better. They must make sure that businesses in this country are provided sufficient work out of the billions of dollars of taxpayers' money that are building our defence assets and our defence capability. If that does not happen, then we will not see businesses grow, we will not see sovereign capability enhanced and we will not see sufficient jobs for workers in this country. It will come down to just the abject failure of this government to do what it promised to do before the last election and continues to promise, without any confidence by anyone that it has done what it promised.</span>

My constituents in Horsley Park and Cecil Park are having their rights as landowners retroactively stripped away by the Berejiklian Liberal government, with not a word of consultationâno more subdivision, no more granny flats for an older relative to move into, no more subdividing for another house to help their children into the housing market. Those residents who live on five-acre blocks often have had plans to subdivide in the future to fund their retirement, and their rights are being stripped away in an act of arrogance by the Berejiklian Liberal government. Those residents have had plans in place, they've had hopes and dreams, and the Berejiklian government simply doesn't care.</span>

The minister for planning wrote to a constituent and claimed that the government had consulted with the people of Horsley Park and had informed them, and he said: 'The draft Western Sydney Aerotropolis Planning Package was publicly exhibited,' and that it: 'was promoted through numerous mediums to reach as many as possible. This included advertisements in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sydney Morning Herald</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Daily Telegraph</span> and on Facebook.' Now, one thing they didn't do was to write to the people of Horsley Park and Cecil Park to inform them of these proposed changes and get their views. All the money they spent on advertising they could have spent on postage stamps in writing to the people of Horsley Park and Cecil Park. I know that because I've done it, twiceâI've written to the people of Horsley Park and Cecil Park to make sure they're aware of these pernicious changes, these arrogant changes, by the Liberal Party.

The minister for planning has been invited. I would hope that they would come and face the people of Horsley Park and tell them, face to face, why their rights are unimportantâtell them why their rights are being stripped away; tell them why their rights as landholders in Western Sydney mean nothing to the Berejiklian Liberal government. Have the guts to turn up face them. Face the people of Horsley Park. Face the people of Cecil Park. Tell them why their rights mean nothing. Tell them why their rights are being stripped away with no consultation. Be honest with the people of Horsley Park and Cecil Park. If those members don't have the guts, the moral fortitude, to turn up and face their residentsâthe member for Mulgoa's constituents, who look to her to represent them in parliamentâthey should hang their heads in shame.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FALINSKI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:39</span>):  I cannot be as entertaining as the previous speaker, but I will do my best to recognise the hardworking nurses and medical staff of the Northern Beaches Hospital because, during our lockdown over Christmas and New Yearâwhen we saved Christmas for the people of Horsley Park and New Year for the people of Australiaâwhen we needed these people most, the nurses and doctors of the Northern Beaches Hospital and Mona Vale Hospital stepped up to the challenge posed by COVID-19.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the best of times working in health care is one of the most difficult professions. During a global pandemic it is almost unbearable. Yet throughout 2020 and 2021 we on the Northern Beaches could not be more grateful to our health professionals. There was no rulebook on how to handle the mass influx of pandemic patients, yet, despite the risks posed to themselves and their families, they persevered through some of the most trying conditions that our hospitals have ever had to face. The crisis was truly unprecedented. The reason we are now in such a strong position and can meet with our family and friends once again is their capacity to respond to the pandemic. Their level of selflessness was exemplary and quite literally saved lives. Businesses today are open, unemployment is falling, and our economy is growing again, only because of the work of our doctors and nurses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mona Vale and Northern Beaches hospitals are the reasons why we now have freedom of movement once again. It's often forgotten that our society is underpinned by the hard work of those in our healthcare system; that whether you are a young professional, a retiree, a student or a small business owner, we all rely on our hospitals during our most vulnerable moments. In many ways the pandemic reminded us of the timeless truth that the health and wellbeing of our community rely on those who serve our community, frequently at their own peril. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst the rest of the world continues to suffer, we stand out as one of the only nations that are now operating at something approaching normality. Cases throughout the world and in many countries continue to cause lockdowns, further decimating livelihoods, driving up unemployment and costing the lives of thousands of victims. It will take countries like the United States years to fully recover from the devastation that is unfolding there today. In contrast, we are already experiencing the beginning of our economic recovery. It is ultimately the fact that our healthcare professionals were able to act decisively during a time of uncertainty and confusion that enabled us to preserve as a nation through one of the most trying times we have ever had to face. Whilst we will not become complacent, we are the envy of the world as we enjoy our basic freedoms and can reclaim livelihoods lost as a result of the pandemic. As we continue to roll out the vaccine, once again we will be relying on health-care workers to help our community's most vulnerable and those who struggle with existing medical conditions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also cognisant of the fact that instances of mental health issues amongst our healthcare workers have risen because of the increased pressure caused by COVID-19. I cannot emphasise enough the importance of supporting those who have helped us during the pandemic. That is why the government is continuing to increase funding for mental health care providers and emergency support services. It is a matter of not only dealing with emergency situations but looking at a plan to deal with the long-term fallout from the pandemic. I was particularly proud during the pandemic when I saw businesses give additional support to our doctors and nurses. One of the groups most affected by the pandemic has been those in the healthcare profession. We thank them today for all that they have done. They have made our lives better, our nation stronger, and our communities more resilient.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265980" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SHARKIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (12<span class="HPS-Time">:43</span>):  After the mortgage, child care is often the biggest cost to family finances. If you don't have extended family to help with the care, you tend to have two choices: either one family member delays re-entering the workforce, or you try and access child care. In regional areas, finding child care is incredibly difficult, let alone the cost of it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to step back in time and talk about my own experience. This was some time ago nowâit was two decades ago. Gee, it went quickly! I first accessed child care when my eldest was a little one. I had to go back to work. I remember it was $180 a week. There was a small rebate you got back from the childcare centre. You then went to Medicareâit was a really clunky system. Thank goodness the government fixed that. Back then, in the year 2000, a family with an income of $55,000 spent around 13 per cent of their disposable income on child care. With reform over the years, that dropped to around seven per cent, but by 2016 it was back to more than 11 per cent of a family's income, and it's higher now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some good points to the new childcare subsidy scheme that the government introduced in 2018 and that we passed in this place, but the devil is in the detail. I acknowledge that the government spends far more on child care now than it ever has in the past. We now spend around $8 billion annually; 20 years ago it was around $1.8 billion a year. However, when those reforms came through, in the first year of the changes one in three families reported that they were still paying the same childcare costs and one in three families were paying higher costs. Some childcare providers chose to increase their fees above what the government's recommended hourly rate was. In regional areas costs are often higher because there's such demand. One of the main objectives of the new childcare scheme was to increase workforce participation, and I just don't think it hit the mark. A year on from when it was introduced, 77 per cent of parents were saying that nothing had really changed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to talk about some of the challenges that are faced by families in my community. There is the high cost, as I mentioned. We have one of the highest net childcare costs in the OECD. A family with two children in child care, with one parent on an average wage and one just below it, will be paying around 17 per cent of their net household income on child care. When we have a look at child care and productivity, we see that affordable child care is the key way to get women back into the workforce. But, while what we spend on child care as a percentage of GDP has increased, it's still less than half a per cent of our national GDP, compared with 1.1 per cent in the UK and just under one per cent in New Zealand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other problem is the cap. The cap is just over $10,000 per child per financial year, and we find that around this time of year families reach their cap. Really, their world caves in around them because they have to pay the full cost. It then gets to a point where people are going to work just to pay for child care. It's an issue we seriously need to address.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look at the regions, including my electorate of Mayo, we see that people are driving a long way just to get their child to child care. I've been lobbying the South Australian government to assist with setting up a community childcare centre near Parndana, on Kangaroo Island, where the nearest provider is at Kingscote. That's an 80-kilometre round trip. It's just impossible for families to get there. This lack of child care in the region is making it very difficult to attract young families to Parndana. When I go back to Parndana, the families that I meet and talk to say they need to have their child in a safe place so they can go back and do the re-fencing on their farms following the fires.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's my hope that the government will look at child care in a very earnest way in the budget that we have coming upâand the next time we come back here will be for the budget. While the reforms implemented back in 2018 were effective, covering 85 per cent of the cost for most families, there are some key bits missing. I think we can address them. We can iron out these issues and make child care more affordable and accessible for all Australian families.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Leichhardt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:48</span>):  Kuranda is a small community of around 4Â½ thousand people located about 30 kilometres directly west of Cairns via the Kuranda Range. The Kuranda economy is heavily reliant on domestic and international tourism and the self-drive market that feeds into that tourism. It has been absolutely decimated by the ongoing effects of the pandemic. I think I could mount a very strong argument that it is the hardest-hit tourism destination in our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Kuranda economy is made up of very small, family owned and operated businesses and several market-stall type businesses. Kuranda businesses are not major conglomerates that could possibly absorb the economic effects of this pandemic. I recently visited Kuranda to meet with members of the Kuranda Traders Association, very capably chaired by Dei Gould, an artist and business owner in the community, and during my visit I had the opportunity of talking to various businesses. One cafe owner that I spoke to said that putting $25 through the cash register in a day was a good day. I met with William Sonnet, a small, long-time garment trader, who said three people had walked through his shop that day and purchased absolutely nothing. You can understand how difficult it is. Talking to them almost brought me to tears, seeing firsthand the utter devastation of this once very vibrant community. It was, in effect, a ghost town.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to COVID, Kuranda township, which, as I said earlier, is highly dependent on international tourism, would welcome an average of 3,000 visitors per day, primarily arriving from Cairns. These visitors provide economic stimulus and employment in a very vibrant town community. The devastating impacts of COVID on the Cairns tourism sector, which supported one in five jobs from direct visitor spend, have seen $3.5 billion ripped out of our local economy. Sadly, the flow-on effect of these sobering figures has decimated the Kuranda tourism market. A further 60 per cent drop-off in visitor spend, or $2 billion, is forecast for June 2021, and that alone has triggered the closure of more than 250 Kuranda businesses. Of the remaining 38 per cent in hibernation, 32 per cent are on reduced hours, leaving less than 15 per cent of products available daily. With reduced visitor numbers and daily product services, Kuranda is a ghost of its former self, with more businesses closed than open, no tour buses in the street, next to no people and very few self-drive visitors. What has been a double whammy for the community is that two major attractions and major sources of visitation, the Skyrail and the Kuranda Scenic Railway, have made recent decisions to operate at a very heavily reduced capacity. This decision has again severely impacted visitation, just when there was a glimmer of hope for the township.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unemployment numbers and economic and community stress are on the increase and there's an expectation that these will continue to increase. As you can see, the situation in Kuranda is certainly beyond bad. It's around this time of the year that we move towards the cooler months. There are many in the House here who decide to escape the southern winter and head up to my neck of the woods with families and loved ones. It's a good opportunity to make sure you put Kuranda on the must-visit list. I have a proposal where the community, rather than just giving up, are looking at changing their business practices. They're looking at a series of about four festivals over the next 12 months where, for a week at a time, they're bringing local people in to start trying to re-engage. I'm certainly very strongly supporting that initiative. We hope that will happen. Also, some of the businesses up there have started to change their business model. There was a small business up there called Bubble Tea that now focuses just on the local Kuranda market, and it is doing quite well. It has been open for only a few weeks. Good luck to them and the business. I would urge all of you here in this place to take the time to head up the range to Kuranda if you're going to Cairns and support local Australian small-business owners and traders and their families. They really will appreciate it. They'll give you a fascinating time. It's a beautiful little village in the rainforest. It will recover. It will come back on steroids, but it's going to take a little bit of time, as we know, as the vaccine rolls out. There's a little bit more time to go, but I'd like to start to see these guys emerging out of this sooner rather than later.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cooper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:53</span>):  Much has been said in the media recently about women in this house, in workplaces around the country and in society generally. In particular, women have quite rightly spoken up following distressing stories of rape and sexism and political expediency being put above human rights. It's been an honour to be here to watch Australia's women rise up, because, as the great song says, the rising of the women is the rising of us all. Many of us feel that this is a time of reckoning, and much has been said about that, but also people ask: 'What is next? What is to be done?' So much can be done now without waiting for reports that could be years away. There are 55 recommendations on the Prime Minister's desk that will make workplaces safer for women workers. We could introduce paid family and domestic violence leave right now. We could properly fund the Workplace Gender Equality Agency to do its job, instead of slashing its funding, year in, year out. They collect data that is vitally important to painting a picture and helping create change. They monitor compliance with current laws, as deficient as they are. But that is important. The agency needs to be resourced. They could establish an independent human resource department for staffers, ensuring that reporting can be made with impunity, without a fear of the staffer losing their job and without it becoming a political problem. That's just to name a few things. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing that has come up recently is the issue of quotas. I am really pleased that the Liberal Party women have reached the conclusion that quotas are worth considering. Quotas do work. That crazy argument that it overrides merit is just thatâcrazy. It is, I am sure, a nonsense to say that only 26 per cent of women in the Liberal Party are smart enough to be elected to government. A while ago I attended a conference. There was a panel of banking executives, all five of them men, and they were asked about affirmative action and quotas. Most of the men, four of them, ran that old merit argument, but one man actually said: 'When I look for a new CEO or executive, I ask around my friends, who are all men. I look for people who I relate to and think I can work with, and that's nearly always men. I look at other executives in the pool around the town, and do you know what? They're all men. When you don't see women, you don't employ them.' So he concluded: 'Yes, you have to have targets. You have to have quotas to simply see women around you, because they are out there. Women of merit are out there. You just don't see them.' Now, for an older, establishment bloke, this was very insightful, because that is how the boys' club works. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many large corporations like PricewaterhouseCoopers now do have targets. The late Joan Kirner once said to me: 'Do you think every man in every position of power, whether a political seat, a CEO position or on a board, got there on merit? I don't think so.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the Labor Party, affirmative action has worked. We have nearly 50 per cent women in the federal parliamentary Labor Party. Jenny Macklin once described her ascension to the cabinet table as 'resetting the agenda'. When she first raised paid parental leave it was almost ignored as being not necessarily the right time at that moment. Now look where we have come. When I became ACTU president the issue of paid leave for people suffering family and domestic violence was viewed by the mostly male ACTU executive as a fringe issue. Now, after years of my campaigning and the campaigning of many of my union sisters, it is Labor Party policy. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having women at the table changes everything. Sure, it doesn't ensure a utopiaâand I'm not suggesting it isâbut it does change things. Just this week we saw the member for Lilley's babies enter the House during a division. She's joined so many Labor women managing this role and having babies, and I'm proud that that's happening in the Labor Party. Change is possible when women are visible in a critical mass. When that happens, change is even more quick. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Almost a year ago today, Annabel Crabb wrote an article for the ABC. She wrote about the transformative nature of quotas on local Indian communities where they'd been set for the election of a local village. The change there was amazing. The visibility of female leaders changed the lives of individuals outside the system to which the quota applied. She concluded profoundly: </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="56430" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DRUM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Nicholls</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:58</span>):  The farmers in the communities of the southern connected system of the Murray-Darling Basin over the last 12 months have enjoyed a relatively good season. We've had crops that have recorded record yields. Some of those results have been stunning. Pastures have again had growth, which has resulted in farmers having very strong hay yields and storages for upcoming seasons. Again, they are in a very good position. The yields in the fruit industry were quite stunning. They have had some of the best yields. Our fruitgrowers have to fight against frost, too much rain, too much heat, insects, birds and hail. Finally they got this incredible year, where they've had the right amount of rain at the right time of the year, only to find that, unfortunately, the Victorian state Labor government closed the opportunity for them to bring in the pickers. That's been a quite demoralising situation in that regard. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the season has been one of the best seasons on record. It's also been a fantastic story for our storages for upcoming irrigation seasons. Dartmouth is now at 63 per cent; this time last year it was 46 per cent. Lake Hume is at 47 per cent, whereas this time last year it was 14 per cent. Eildon, which feeds the Goulburn, is now at 60 per cent, whereas this time last year it was 36 per cent. The coming irrigation season therefore should see fantastic water allocations and reasonable prices for temporary water. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But now is not the time to relax. Now, in good times, is when you make the best water policy decisions. So we should be using this time to effectively look at what type of policies we want to have around water for when we face our next dry period, our next drought. In the next drought the human cost of those bad water policies is absolutely heartbreaking, as people have to walk off their farms because they simply cannot afford to purchase water on the temporary market. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So this is the opportunity now where we should be looking to see some of the successes that we've made with water policy. We have, in fact, put a socioeconomic test around what is called the 450, meaning that any water policy cannot have a social or economic detriment to the community surrounding the project that you are contemplating. What this is seeing is that effectively all on-farm efficiency projects have to be stopped, because with the on-farm efficiency projects you see that half of the savings of those projects go off to the environment. It diminishes the overall pool that's available for irrigation, and once you diminish that pool that's available for irrigation you put the price of water at a higher level than where it previously was. David Littleproud was the minister when we implemented the socioeconomic neutrality test. That's been a significant piece of legislation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not easy to change the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. To change any part of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan you have to get the agreement of all four states. You have to then get the agreement of the federal parliament, both the Lower House and the Senate. So you understand, with everybody having to agree to any change, it makes it very difficult for people like me who represent a significant irrigation area where your constituents simply believe that because you're in the federal parliament, and you're in government, you should be able to change this horrendous policy. You should be able to look at where the Murray-Darling Basin Plan started, the detrimental effect it's had on the communities that have been affected. 'Surely, you're in governmentâwhy don't you just change it?' But we can't change it unless we bring everybody else with us, unless everybody in the House, everybody in the Senate and everybody in South Australia is honest enough to realise that we have taken too much water out of agriculture to try and fix these environmental outcomes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now is the time. We've had the Sefton report. We've had so many reports that are all effectively saying the same thing. In looking back to where we started, we designed this plan in 2012. We've now had nine years of looking at the outcomes and consequences of taking this amount of water away from irrigation communities. We can see the damage that has been done, and yet we can't change it. We can't make this plan an adaptive plan. All our people want is for everybody to have the courage to look at the consequences and say enough is enough.</span>
