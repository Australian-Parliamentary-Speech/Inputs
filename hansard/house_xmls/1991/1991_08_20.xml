         —This motion, moved by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), is made necessary by the decision of the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) to deliver his Budget Speech at 3 p.m. this afternoon. Had the Treasurer not opted for that particular timeslot, Standing and Sessional Orders would have governed the routine of business for today.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Opposition does not intend to oppose the motion that has been moved by the Leader of the House because it accepts that the Treasurer should be able to make his speech on the 1991 Budget at a time of his choosing. But in indicating that the Opposition will not seek to frustrate the Treasurer in this regard, I seek from the Leader of the House an assurance that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) will be able to make his speech on the Budget at a time of his choosing.

       <para>
        It has been traditional since the Budget Speech was first televised for the Treasurer to deliver his speech at 7.30 p.m. on the Tuesday evening and for the Leader of the Opposition to respond at 7.30 p.m. on the Thursday evening. There was no consultation between the Government and the Opposition in relation to the change, so I assume that the Government is prepared to allow the Leader of the Opposition to deliver his speech at a time of his choosing, namely, the traditional time of 7.30 p.m. on Thursday. I seek that assurance from the Leader of the House.
       </para>
       <para>
        Assuming that the Leader of the Opposition will be able to make his speech at the time of his choosing, the Opposition expects that those radio stations and television stations that broadcast the Treasurer's speech this afternoon live will also broadcast the Leader of the Opposition's speech live.

         —I heard an interjection, `Under the cover of darkness'. I think the Government is going into a state of darkness because it does not want the Treasurer to be seen by a large audience; it wants to minimise the exposure. So the Treasurer opts to deliver his speech at 3 p.m. The Leader of the Opposition would like to deliver his speech at 7.30 p.m. when a larger number of people will be available to watch that telecast.

        I remind him and the House, and indeed others who may be listening, that we do not want a return to what occurred in the last session of this Parliament-indeed, in the last several sessions of this Parliament under this Government-when a large number of Bills were introduced and guillotined through the House within a matter of days or, in some instances, in a matter of hours. In this year's autumn sitting we were compelled to deal, under a guillotine, with 34 Bills in less than four days, giving at most 40 minutes on each Bill. I seek the assurance of the Leader of the House that this will not be repeated during this session.

       <para>
        With regard to the second point raised-the list of Bills to be introduced and passed during this session-I am mindful of the need to keep the Opposition up to date on what the Government has before it in terms of its legislative intentions, but it is not possible to provide at this point in the session the complete list of activity that the Government would contemplate. I do accept, too, that it is desirable, if we can possibly avoid it, not to get into a situation where extensive guillotine activity has to apply. There are a whole series of factors which govern that, including unexpected requirements for governments to act on matters which come before it in a more urgent way than they might otherwise have anticipated.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will see what can be done in terms of supplying a temporary list, at least, as to what the Government's intentions are with regard to legislation this session, but I could not undertake that it would be a complete list or that it would be necessarily held to. All sorts of factors govern Government decisions as to whether or not items it might schedule are proceeded with, and there is the legislation arising out of the Budget.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the first matter-whether or not we will pursue tradition with regard to the Leader of the Opposition's reply to the Budget statement-the tradition in recent times has been that the response takes place at the same time of day that the initial speech is made. If we are going to look at traditions in relation to time, we see that the Budget used to be delivered at 8 p.m. and not at 7.30 p.m. It has been delivered at different times during the day throughout the history of this Parliament. In recent times it has been delivered at 7.30 p.m. at the then Treasurer's initiative. The new Treasurer (Mr Kerin) has decided that it should be delivered at 3 p.m. Therefore, we will be facilitating an opportunity for the Leader of the Opposition to reply at 3 p.m. on Thursday.

         —My question is directed to the Prime Minister. With your indulgence, Mr Speaker, I wish to preface my question by stating that the Opposition, like the Government, is deeply disturbed by yesterday's illegal seizure of power in the Soviet Union. We are particularly concerned by the very serious threat which is now posed to the economic and political reform movement in the Soviet Union. Without that movement, the current difficulties which that country faces will only dangerously escalate. Against that background, I ask the Prime Minister two questions. First, are there any practical measures which the Government is considering to assist international efforts aimed at averting a return to the old communist order in the Soviet Union? Secondly, will the Australian Government join the United States Government in refusing to recognise the leaders of yesterday's illegal coup?

         —I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. It had been my intention to make a comment by way of answer to a question on this issue. I will do that now and pick up the points that were raised by the Leader of the Opposition. I say at the outset that I am very pleased-of course, I expected it to be the case-that the Opposition joins unreservedly with the Government in the deep disturbance that we feel as a result of the events of the last 24 hours in the Soviet Union.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There has been, quite clearly, an attempt to overthrow the constitutional Government of the Soviet Union. It is too early yet to conclude whether that attempt will succeed. We hope that the people of the Soviet Union who have benefited so much from the reforms that have been initiated by President Gorbachev will reject this attempt to seize power by the conservative forces within the Soviet Union. We have certainly been heartened overnight to hear of the beginnings of resistance to the coup, and we very much welcome the call by President Yeltsin of the Russian Republic for the reinstatement of President Gorbachev.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is clear that the purpose of yesterday's coup is to reverse the process of economic and political reform which has been instituted in the Soviet Union by President Gorbachev. Those processes have given the Soviet people at long last an opportunity to establish durable democratic institutions which would respect and promote their political liberty and social well-being. It certainly would be a tragedy if that opportunity were lost. Equally, it would be a tragedy if the process of economic reform in the Soviet Union were brought to a halt. The Soviet Union, as everyone now appreciates, has extraordinarily deep economic problems, but no-one at all should imagine that the solutions to those problems lie in a return to the centralised command system which in fact created the problems.
       </para>
       <para>
        Beyond our concern for the Soviet people, the Australian Government shares with governments all over the world a concern that the enormous achievements of President Gorbachev in revolutionising Soviet foreign policy should be preserved. Obviously, we hope that whoever holds power will recognise that a return to the Cold War is impossible. Even without a return of the confrontation of the Cold War, we are concerned that a conservative regime in Moscow would undermine the spirit of cooperation which has had such a decisive and beneficial effect on international affairs in recent years-in Europe, the Middle East, southern Africa and even in Cambodia and the Asia-Pacific region. The Australian Government is conveying its views and concerns on these issues directly to the Soviet Embassy in Canberra and also through our Embassy in Moscow.
       </para>
       <para>
        The future tone of our relations with the Soviet Union, including in relation to financial assistance and other forms of aid, will clearly depend on developments there. We are keeping in close touch with our friends and allies and we are continuing to monitor developments in the Soviet Union very closely.
       </para>
       <para>
        As will be recalled, this Government was among the first to recognise and to welcome the magnitude and the fundamental nature of the changes which President Gorbachev started to introduce when he assumed the leadership of the Soviet Union in 1985. Since that time we have worked very hard to develop a close and effective working relationship with the Soviet Union under his leadership, and certainly to encourage the reforms which he has fostered.
       </para>
       <para>
        We would be very disturbed to see those reforms undone. May I say-and I know that the Leader of the Opposition and all members of the Opposition would join with us-that we would be totally disturbed if there was any attempt in any way to harm President Gorbachev or any members of his family.
       </para>
       <para>
        We urge the Soviet people to maintain the reform of their institutions, to continue the rebuilding of their country and to sustain the cooperation between the Soviet Union and the rest of the world, which has meant so much to the world at large since 1985. In general terms, what I have said there covers the points that have been raised by the Leader of the Opposition.
       </para>
       <para>
        In regard to his first question about whether there were any practical measures, I would make the point that we will certainly put on hold any cooperative arrangements that we have with the Soviet Union. I would expect that the Leader of the Opposition would regard that as appropriate and relevant to the question he asked. As I have indicated, we will stay in close consultation with our friends and allies so that there can be some coordination of the response of like-minded nations to the developments there.
       </para>
       <para>
        As to the question about actual recognition, the answer is incorporated in what I have said. We will monitor these developments very closely. We will make the decisions which we think are most appropriate. But, as I say, I am very pleased that the Leader of the Opposition has indicated that when I speak on these matters now, I do so, obviously as I expected I would be able to, with the complete support of the Leader of the Opposition and those behind him.

I ask the Minister whether he can explain how disability services are to be split between the two levels of government.

         —I thank the honourable member for Phillip for her question which deals with the recent agreement signed at the Special Premiers Conference in July. The agreement, which relates to services under the Disability Services Act, deals with different services in this area at Commonwealth and State levels.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The agreement is important in the sense that it is the first agreement reached in terms of social policy, an area of great concern to the Premiers. The agreement is based on a clear division of responsibility. The Commonwealth will take responsibility for labour market related services for people with disabilities whereas the States will be responsible for accommodation and support services. The advantage of that is clarity, in the sense that from the point of view of consumers it is clear who is responsible.
       </para>
       <para>
        In terms of safeguards, it is also clear that before this agreement can be brought to fruition there needs to be reciprocal legislation at the State level mirroring the Disability Services Act at the Federal level. That means that the quite progressive principles in that legislation will become nationwide. These principles will be picked up by the States. The rights that this Parliament has enacted will be guaranteed by parliaments around the country and, effectively, Commonwealth legislation will become national legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Obviously, there are large financial questions involved. Over $1 billion over five years will be passed from the Commonwealth to the States for them to administer with respect to accommodation. In this way, we will be able to maintain the effort and the momentum of services provided by the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para>
        An additional $140m will be provided to help sustain the quality of services and to improve the quality in some cases; not all the accommodation handed over will need investment and repair. In addition, the Government has taken account in this agreement of the need for growth, and $100m will be going to the States in relation to that.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Phillip asked about the benefits in terms of consumers. Certainly there are benefits in terms of administration and the duplication of administration. The approach is that much simpler, and the efficiency gains can be translated into more and better services. There is growth, so there needs to be no uncertainty that the needed growth that should occur in the 1990s will in fact occur. An effort will be made resulting from this agreement to deal with the difficult area of eliminating gaps, particularly in the psychiatric area.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, this agreement will allow for joint planning and priority setting so that the Commonwealth, together with the States, not at the level of detail but at the strategic level will ensure that a great piece of legislation passed by this Parliament is realised in quality services to one of the most needy groups in the Australian community.

I will not be exhaustive in referring to the achievements that mark the performance of this Government during his period as Treasurer and my Prime Ministership, but the ones to which I go are indeed very significant.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        If one were to talk about employment, I believe the honourable member for Blaxland would share with me the pleasure that during the period he was Treasurer we saw a growth in employment of 1.5 million new jobs. That growth remains at over 1.3 million, and the growth achieved over that period, which honourable members opposite never like to be reminded of, was a rate of growth in employment four times as fast as they achieved. I am sure the ex-Treasurer is proud of that achievement and so am I.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am also proud of the fact that when we were faced by circumstances, as we were, where the rate of increase in expenditure was twice as fast as the increase in production, he and I together-and our colleagues-had the courage to take the decisions that were necessary in those circumstances to slow down the Australian economy. Had we not done that, the world would have imposed upon us a significantly more drastic outcome than we have had to experience. If one is going to talk about the impact of that period of his stewardship of the economy as Treasurer in the Government I have had the honour to lead, I think we would share pleasure in the fact that we were prepared to make decisions in terms of the allocation of this country's resources that overcame the obscene legacy left to us by the previous Government. When those opposite walked out of office, they left us with a taxation system that was just about the worst in the Western world.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are proud of the fact-I share pride with him-that, as distinct from a country which was described as one in which it was a matter of choice as to whether the rich would pay tax, by the measures which the previous Treasurer brought in as Treasurer in my Government, we imposed a range of taxation measures which increased both the efficiency of the taxation system and its equity. Without being exhaustive about that, of course, I refer to the capital gains tax; I refer to the fringe benefits tax; and I refer to the system of imputation, which gave a lead virtually to the rest of the world. If honourable members opposite want to talk about other things which the former Treasurer, as Treasurer in my Government, was associated with, I refer to another obscene legacy that the Opposition left us with: in this country, only one out of three kids went on to year 12 under the Opposition's education system, because education--

Prior to our assuming office, they had the responsibility for the last seven years of allocating resources to ensure that kids would stay on in school. They did not do so; only one in three did. As a result of the decisions taken during the period the honourable member for Blaxland was Treasurer in my Government, we transformed that to a position where two in three of the kids stayed on in school. The Opposition did nothing about trying to create the clever country; together, during that period, we did. Both the former Treasurer and I have been quite straightforward in saying that in our eight years in office, some mistakes were made--

Together we have done many things of which we should be proud and in which we share a legitimate pride.

         —I thank the honourable member for Burke for his question. Of course, we are concerned-as I would imagine those on the opposite side of the House are-that time is running out. Time is indeed running out for a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round. Nine months have now passed since the failure of the ministerial meeting in Brussels last December. Unless real progress is made by the end of this year or very early in 1992, we fear the political momentum required to conclude the Round successfully will be dissipated. Of course, there are many reasons to be worried on that score, but the most obvious-as I think the honourable gentleman would realise-is that once we get into 1991-92, the United States starts getting into its presidential election processes. That of itself will dissipate some of the momentum that will be required for the purposes of a successful outcome.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The importance of a successful outcome to the Round for the world economy and for Australia, in particular, is as high as ever. It needs no detailed elaboration by me. This Round is particularly significant to Australia because the GATT is, for the first time as we know, very much as a result of Australia's efforts addressing the question of agriculture.
       </para>
       <para>
        The overwhelming responsibility for a successful conclusion to the Round rests with the Europeans. As I wrote to the leaders of the G7 meeting before the London summit last month, the key to the future of world trade is GATT; the key to GATT is the Uruguay Round; the key to the Uruguay Round is agriculture; and the key to agriculture is reform of the European Community's agricultural protection policies. The Europeans are principally responsible for the corruption of the international market in agricultural goods, which adversely affects this country and other free traders in the Cairns Group.
       </para>
       <para>
        We welcome signs that the European Community is addressing serious reform of the common agricultural policy. As for the Uruguay Round, we do not make unreasonable or inflexible demands-that has not characterised the approach we have taken, either individually or in our role as leader of the Cairns Group-but we do seek specific and concrete commitments in each of the three areas of internal support, border protection and export subsidies.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have asked the Leader of the Opposition to join the Government in sending a bipartisan mission to Europe to press Australia's concerns about these issues. The mission will be led by the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, Dr Blewett. I am disappointed that the Leader of the Opposition has chosen to grandstand on this issue by suggesting that he and I should go off next week on this mission. It is pure and utter grandstanding-the Leader of the Opposition knows it; everyone behind him knows it; and everyone in the community knows it.

         —If there is any offence taken, I withdraw. The point is that the honourable member for Port Adelaide raised a very serious question which was greeted by guffaws on the Opposition side. The honourable member for Port Adelaide was referring to the fact that five young Australians went away to participate in the physics olympiad. Every now and then there are competitions where young high school students from all around the world compete in the areas of mathematics, chemistry and physics, and up until recently Australia has had a rather haphazard participation on these occasions.

       <para>
        This Government has decided to fund a more regular and high level participation of young Australians in these olympiads. I am delighted to say that the team which has just returned from the physics olympiad has done better than any previous Australian team and, indeed, any team from any Western nation. We ended up coming sixth behind China, the Soviet Union, Hungary, Romania and Czechoslovakia and in front of Britain, the Netherlands, Poland, the United States, Bulgaria and Germany. If the Opposition could put to one side its particular predilections, it might be able to stand with the Government and congratulate these young Australians on what has been a very grand achievement on their part.
       </para>
       <para>
        I make the point also that Australia has been invited to host the 1995 physics olympiad; the Government has accepted that invitation and will be funding that activity appropriately.
       </para>
       <para>
        This reveals that there are very many fine young Australians in our education system who are able to pit their particular intellectual strengths against those from all other countries. I think that we should today celebrate the achievements of Stephen Ong, Peter Cotton, Kerwyn Foo, Roshan Ganeshan and Toby Gifford, all five of whom achieved awards for their participation in this olympiad.

Does the Prime Minister agree that the order of another 400,000 Australians are underemployed-that is, they desire to work full time or longer than the few hours that now qualifies them as officially employed, but are unable to find such jobs-so that over one million Australians are either unemployed or underemployed, not to mention the discouraged people who have given up looking for work of any kind or duration?

         —I do not dispute that in addition to those officially mentioned and listed as unemployed there would be some who are underemployed in the sense that the honourable member for Berowra has mentioned. I do not dispute that, although I will not give my assent to the figure of 400,000 that he mentioned. There would be a significant number-I do not dispute that. If the honourable gentleman is going to look at these developments, he should also take account of the fact that in the period of this Government there has been a very significant increase in the participation rate, and that results from a number of actions and decisions made by this Government.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Without repeating the sorts of figures that have been given before, I think the honourable gentleman knows as a fact that, if those opposite had at this time the participation rate that we had when we came into office, then the figures of unemployed would be much lower. At this early stage of the Budget session, I want to put on record a point that I have made before; that is, if those on the other side of this place are going to talk about levels of unemployment and give the impression that they have some real compassion and concern for the unemployed, then they might address themselves to the question as to why they behaved so appallingly to the unemployed when they were in government. When they were in government, they deliberately took action to ensure that the income available to the unemployed would be slashed in real terms. They had no compassion and no concern for them at all.
       </para>
       <para>
        I remind the House of the figures again. This is what those opposite did during their period of government in terms of the income that they made available to those people who were dependent upon the community for assistance in their time of need. During their period in office, they slashed the income available for the unemployed single adult in real terms by 19 per cent. That was their performance. As against that, this Government in its compassion has increased that sum in real terms by 26 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us take the case of a married pensioner with a couple of kids. During their period in office those opposite slashed the real income of those people by 2 per cent, whereas we have increased it by over 20 per cent. I would have thought that the honourable gentleman would feel that it is morally correct to give the totally rounded picture. I do not deny-in fact, I have publicly expressed-my deep regret and concern for the pain and suffering that has been caused to hundreds of thousands of my fellow Australians by the decisions that we have had to take. The distinction to be made on this issue is that my Government and I have had to make these decisions which have brought about these unemployment figures. At the same time, we have not sat back and deliberately cut the real income by way of benefit to these people, as those opposite did when they were in government. We have made sure that the real income of these people will be consistently increased so that the community as a whole will accept the responsibility it must have of caring for its most disadvantaged members.

         —I thank the honourable member for her question and for her keen and ongoing interest in this issue. The dumping of ballast water is an international issue, but it has particular implications for Australia. It is estimated that some 14 species of fish, invertebrates and algae have been introduced to Australian waters through ballast water and that these introduced species have been the cause of an exotic seaweed-which now covers 15 kilometres of the eastern Tasmanian coast-and a variety of micro-organisms which can cause blooms and shellfish poisoning. So the issue is, by definition, a serious one.

       <para>
        In terms of addressing this complex problem, I am pleased to advise the honourable member that Australia is leading the world in the development of guidelines for the discharge of ships' ballast water. The rest of the world is now set to follow Australia's example. The International Maritime Organisation is to introduce a system of voluntary guidelines over the discharge of ships' ballast water, largely based on the system introduced in Australia in February last year.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is heartening that the system, developed by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service in association with shippers and exporters, is now to be used as the model to protect marine environments around the world. The adoption by the IMO of Australian guidelines is another feather in the cap for AQIS and confirms the high regard in which AQIS is held internationally.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian guidelines enjoy good support from the shipping industry, with about 80 per cent of vessels entering Australian ports now complying with them. The guidelines developed by AQIS give shipping companies a range of options to avoid the uptake and discharge of harmful organisms. These include, for example, reballasting at sea rather than at a particular port, en route reballasting, in-hold treatment and onshore ballast water treatment.
       </para>
       <para>
        In a world of increasing international trade, there are no easy answers to the problem of ballast water discharge. The guidelines established by AQIS, and now agreed to by the International Marine Organisation, are a vital first step in effectively addressing the issue. It is, however, an area where future scientific research is needed. In this regard, I have recently approved a major research program which is considering further treatment options and associated research.

I am hoping that they will be further boosted by the visit by Dr Isa Kalantari, who is the Minister for Agriculture and Rural Affairs in Iran. Dr Kalantari arrives today for a 10-day visit to Australia, during which he will join with me in chairing the joint ministerial commission.

        Already our governments have been developing ways of expanding links and of developing cooperation in the international arena. I will just mention two. Already we have made substantial progress in the implementation of a postgraduate student arrangement program. There are now over 200 Iranian students studying in Australian universities under scholarships funded by the Iranian Government. Our experts have worked closely together in seeking negotiations for banning the use of chemical weapons. The economic and trade relationship is also improving. Indeed, Iran is now Australia's largest market for wheat worldwide and the largest Middle East market for both primary and manufactured products. Last year, 1990, the value of our exports to Iran totalled $614m.
       </para>
       <para>
        The size and quality of the delegation for the joint commission are evidence of the importance that both countries attach to the relationship. Dr Kalantari is leading a delegation of 45 Iranian public and private sector representatives, and in the Australian delegation over 70 companies will be represented. We are in this country looking to build on existing trade and to seek new opportunities to expand cooperation, particularly in mining, in manufacturing, in agriculture-particularly in the sugar industry-and in other areas. To underpin our strong commitment to expand commercial ties with Iran, Australia, through Austrade EFIC, will make available a credit line to support Australian exports to Iran.

       <para>
        We note, however, that the trade is very much one way in our favour, and we will be examining means to redress by various means the imbalance in the bilateral trade relationship. We will offer trade development training to Iranian exporters in this country, we will be promoting cooperation between Australian and Iranian oil companies, and hopefully we will see the establishment of an Australia-Iran Chamber of Commerce. These are all methods we shall employ to further what is becoming the most significant trade relationship we have in the Middle East.

       <para>
        The honourable member asked why they are in their current circumstances. There are a number of reasons for that. In a number of circumstances they are there because they were encouraged to overproduce by unrealistic pricing mechanisms that were not sending the right signals. In other cases they have been affected not because there is a lack of demand in other countries, but because those countries cannot pay the money. I think we would all understand the importance of that problem in the light of what has happened in the Soviet Union in the last 24 hours. In addition, of course, farms have been hit by the recession. There are also circumstances pertaining to particular industries that invariably relate to them.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having said that, I have tried to develop two approaches. One relates to the medium to long term approach, which is to get us away from a commodity culture and a reliance on commodities for our export earnings. We have only to look at the trend rate in both price and volume to understand why agriculture has been declining in this country as a sustainable source of income. The growth in world trade is not in commodities, nor is the certainty or the guarantee in price. That is why I am a strong believer that the longer term solution is in ensuring that we get more effective value adding, not just for the agricultural sector but for the mining sector.
       </para>
       <para>
        The decisions this Government has taken in relation to the manufacturing sector place us well to ensure that we can combine, for the first time in this country, efficient agriculture with efficient manufacturing. I have confidence that that approach will succeed, in particular because of the strategy we are developing in relation to the food processing industry, the fibre processing industry and the forest products industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having said that, I accept that the medium to long term solution does not hold much comfort in the current circumstances where people are hurting. It is against that background that, in the time I have had the portfolio, I have looked at the flexibility in existing programs, plus the opportunities that present themselves in the context of the Budget. Obviously I cannot talk about the latter now, but those opposite will know about it in the next half hour.
       </para>
       <para>
        In relation to existing programs, I deliberately went to the question of using the rural adjustment scheme to come to grips with the real needs of people who require income support but who cannot otherwise access it. Having got the agreement of the States to implement the rural adjustment scheme-the States, I might add, were frustrating the implementation of RAS-at the same time I introduced a flexibility to provide income support to people who wanted to remain on the land and who did not have to make the commitment to exit. That was to give a breathing space pending the initiatives to be announced in the Budget.
       </para>
       <para>
        So those opposite should not come in here and tell us we do not understand about the problems: we do. We understand fully about them. They require short term measures, which we are approaching. They also require the longer term structural adjustments that those opposite were never prepared to take or to lead. They will get that leadership from this Government. They deserve some sensible leadership.

        In the year ended 30 June 1991, Australian domestic airlines carried almost 14.2 million passengers, a record for a financial year, exceeding the previous 1988-89 record of 14 million. It has to be remembered that that was our bicentennial year and our Brisbane Expo year. That is quite a stunning achievement. Since deregulation, three all-time record quarters have been achieved-December 1990, March 1991 and June 1991. The June quarter performance was a record on all major industry indicators: passengers, revenue passenger kilometres, and available seat kilometres. Traffic for the week ending 2 August is up almost 40 per cent on the average weekly level for July last year.

        That the Bill be now read a second time.
       </para>
       <para>
        In doing so I present the Hawke Labor Government's ninth Budget.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Budget comes after a year in which the Australian economy fell into recession following seven years of strong economic and employment growth. It was a disappointing year for all Australians; a year of lost jobs, squeezed profits and dashed hopes.
       </para>
       <para>
        But we could not continue to spend more than we produce without imports being far too high and bringing on an acute current account crisis.
       </para>
       <para>
        We were living beyond our means. We could not continue to do that without facing dire consequences.
       </para>
       <para>
        A slowing of the economy to more sustainable rates of growth had become a necessity. Managing that transition, however, is a difficult and delicate task at any time.
       </para>
       <para>
        A number of factors accentuated these difficulties over the past year or so.
       </para>
       <para>
        There was an unprecedented and unsustainable boom in asset prices in the second half of the 1980s. Its subsequent unwinding pulled the rug out from many speculative investments and business ventures.
       </para>
       <para>
        The failure of some financial institutions heightened the loss of confidence amongst investors and consumers, further contracting the level of demand.
       </para>
       <para>
        Added to that, a tighter monetary policy was operating for the first time in a deregulated environment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Exacerbating these influences, the decline in our terms of trade through falling commodity prices severely hurt the rural sector.
       </para>
       <para>
        The objective of stepping down to lower growth but stopping short of recession was not achieved. The Government takes no satisfaction from that.
       </para>
       <para>
        It will give no comfort to those Australians adversely affected by this recession, but we should recognise that several other major countries had a similar experience. In particular, the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom have also been in recession.
       </para>
       <para>
        Indeed, that added to our difficulties by reducing the demand for our exports, especially commodities.
       </para>
       <para>
        The signs are still tentative-and may remain so for a little time yet-but the Australian economy is set for recovery in 1991-92. The recovery will be slow.
       </para>
       <para>
        The task we face is to ensure that the recovery proceeds at a sustainable pace and that we lock in the economic gains of the past year. These gains relate particularly to the current account and the rate of inflation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Last year saw substantial improvement in our current account, not just through reduced imports but also through stronger export growth.
       </para>
       <para>
        The contribution of net exports to growth in 1990-91 was the highest in three decades. This achievement was all the more remarkable in the face of the difficult conditions in our major export markets.
       </para>
       <para>
        The current account deficit declined from almost 6% of GDP two years ago to 4% last year. And it will fall again this year.
       </para>
       <para>
        Inflation has also been very substantially reduced. Over the last year, inflation fell to 3.4% compared with 7.7% during the previous year.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is a major gain. For the first time in decades, our inflation rate is clearly below that of our major trading partners. This improves our level of international competitiveness.
       </para>
       <para>
        We must not let these important achievements slip away. What is now required is a rate of recovery that consolidates this progress and secures a return to sustained employment growth.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the end of the day, what counts for investor and business confidence, investment and a larger traded goods sector, and thereby increased employment, is getting the fundamentals right.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Budget has been formulated with that objective foremost in mind.
       </para>
       <para>
        BUDGET OUTCOME
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Speaker, the Budget this year will be in deficit for the first time in five years.
       </para>
       <para>
        By allowing the Budget to swing into deficit, the Government has provided a substantial cushion-about $13 billion over two years-to counter the impact of the downturn. This stimulus will contribute to the recovery in the coming year.
       </para>
       <para>
        Nonetheless, we have maintained the underlying integrity of the Budget. Since last year's Budget, all new expenditure decisions by the Government have been paid for by savings in other areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a result of the economic downturn, outlays are expected to rise and revenues fall in real terms. The net result of these changes is that the Budget deficit this year is estimated to be about $4.7 billion.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a share of the economy, outlays will be slightly higher than last year, but this increase is more than accounted for by the increase in outlays associated with the slowdown in economic activity.
       </para>
       <para>
        Revenue will be at the lowest level as a share of GDP since the late 1970s. This reflects both the full year effects of the tax cuts made last year, and the impact of the economic slowdown.
       </para>
       <para>
        OUTLAYS
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Speaker, I now turn to outlays.
       </para>
       <para>
        FAMILIES INCOME PACKAGE
       </para>
       <para>
        The introduction of the Family Allowance Supplement by Labor in 1987 provided the basis for targeted income support to families. Today, Mr Speaker, I am announcing that this Labor Government is building on that work.
       </para>
       <para>
        A major families package will provide additional assistance to low and medium income families with children, and target Family Allowances more effectively.
       </para>
       <para>
        From April 1992, the income test for the receipt of maximum benefits under the Family Allowance Supplement will be increased from $18,000 to $19,300. This will raise the income threshold for the maximum benefit to align it with the indexed AUSTUDY threshold.
       </para>
       <para>
        This change means that a family earning $20,000 per year with two children will be eligible for family assistance payments of up to $97 per week free of tax, an increase of up to $12.50 per week.
       </para>
       <para>
        To encourage eligible families to apply for the Family Allowance Supplement, the administrative arrangements for the payment of income support will be simplified.
       </para>
       <para>
        From January 1993, existing income support schemes for the care of children will be combined into a single payment payable to the principal carer.
       </para>
       <para>
        These changes will improve the arrangements covering the current structure of family assistance payments.
       </para>
       <para>
        From January 1992, the Government will introduce an assets test for the Family Allowance at $600,000 of net assets excluding the family home.
       </para>
       <para>
        For the next two years, families with very low incomes but assets above the threshold will be able to retain the Family Allowance as long as they meet a liquid funds test.
       </para>
       <para>
        The assets test for the Family Allowance Supplement will also be relaxed from January 1992 for the next two years.
       </para>
       <para>
        Low income families with assets above the current level of $347,500 but below $600,000 will become eligible for the Family Allowance Supplement provided they meet the liquid funds test.
       </para>
       <para>
        These measures address, for the first time, the particular problems faced by income poor but asset rich business people, especially farmers.
       </para>
       <para>
        Statements detailing these and other measures are being released by the Ministers for Social Security and for Primary Industries and Energy.
       </para>
       <para>
        MEDICARE
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Speaker, the Budget also contains significant reforms to Medicare.
       </para>
       <para>
        Medicare is a fair health system-it guarantees medical services to people who need them.
       </para>
       <para>
        However every 20 years the number of medical services used per person in Australia doubles. That was happening before Medicare, and is still happening. If that continues, all Australians will have to pay more for health care.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is therefore reforming Medicare to change benefit arrangements to slow the growth in the use of medical services and to assist the medical profession to lift the quality of care available from General Practitioners.
       </para>
       <para>
        Subject to safeguards, the Medicare benefit for visits to a GP will be reduced by $3.50 from November 1991. Doctors who direct bill Medicare will be able, if they wish, to recoup this sum from their patients.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, this Medicare benefit will be reduced by a further $1.50 from November 1992.
       </para>
       <para>
        The following safeguards will ensure that those most in need retain access to free health care.
       </para>
       <para>
        First, holders of various concession cards-that is, pensioners, veterans, low income earners and usually their dependants-will continue to have access to GP services at no cost provided their GP chooses to direct bill. A total of 4.5 million Australians, mostly low income people, will be protected in this way.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, heavy users of GP services-families in particular-will gain extra protection. From next January, the existing safety net which applies to individuals will become a family based safety net with a threshold of $246 per year. Thus, for a family of two adults and two children, the threshold will be reduced from $984 to $246.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government will undertake discussions with the medical profession on a range of issues concerning General Practice, including funding mechanisms and doctor supply.
       </para>
       <para>
        Further changes are also being undertaken in diagnostic services to contain rapidly growing costs. These changes reflect agreements reached with relevant pathology and radiology professional bodies.
       </para>
       <para>
        In time, these reforms will save almost a billion dollars a year.
       </para>
       <para>
        BETTER CITIES
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Speaker, the cities of the nation have to change.
       </para>
       <para>
        And they have to change if Australians are to be provided with better access to facilities and services.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Deputy Prime Minister will announce details of a program aimed at creating better cities. The program is the first step in building a new partnership between Federal, State and Local Governments so that our cities and the quality of life of the people who live in them can be improved.
       </para>
       <para>
        Commonwealth funding for this program will be more than $800 million over a five year period. $56 million will be allocated by this Labor Government during 1991-92.
       </para>
       <para>
        EDUCATION AND TRAINING
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Speaker, better training and education provides the basis for more meaningful jobs and a richer community life.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Government has increased the number of higher education places from around 250,000 in 1983 to 350,000 in 1991. There will be further increases in 1992 additional to the 13,000 already approved for 1992 in the current three year arrangements.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another $57 million will be provided for capital funding of higher education in the next two financial years. There will also be increased research funding.
       </para>
       <para>
        These decisions are in addition to the cost of the recent increase in academic salaries, over $120 million this year.
       </para>
       <para>
        To help pay for these items, the Higher Education Contribution will be increased by $144 on top of normal indexation.
       </para>
       <para>
        A package of improvements to student financial assistance schemes is being announced by the relevant Ministers. This includes an increase in the personal income test threshold and a further extension of eligibility to students who undertake accredited TAFE-type courses.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, spending on training and labour market programs will increase by $260 million this year, an increase of nearly 50%. Increased training and work experience for the long-term unemployed through the JOBSKILLS program and additional funding for Technical and Further Education will also be provided.
       </para>
       <para>
        An enhanced literacy training package will be detailed by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training.
       </para>
       <para>
        NATIONAL RAIL CORPORATION
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Speaker, as announced at the July Special Premiers' Conference, governments agreed to the establishment of a National Rail Corporation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victorian and Western Australian Governments will provide equity for the Corporation. This is expected to exceed $400 million during the next six years.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Corporation will operate commercially in line with the best established practice overseas. This reform will secure an efficient interstate rail freight system.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a result, the Corporation will substantially reduce the losses now crippling the Australian rail system. It is expected to break even within three years and become totally self-supporting after five.
       </para>
       <para>
        ENVIRONMENT
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Speaker, this Government's strong commitment to the environment is reinforced in this Budget by an increase in spending of almost 30% to $143 million.
       </para>
       <para>
        We recognise that both the natural environment and the urban environment are important to Australians.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are meeting our commitment to establish a Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency this year at a cost of over $8 million.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have decided to double funding to the Endangered Species Program to $5 million.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia shares responsibility with other nations for the global environment. The Government will nearly double international environmental assistance to $20 million, including making our contribution to the Global Environment Facility managed by the World Bank.
       </para>
       <para>
        ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER PEOPLES
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Speaker, another area of concern to all Australians is the disadvantage that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples experience.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Reconciliation Process is the backdrop to the Government's programs to redress that disadvantage in the coming decade. As part of the Reconciliation Process, $2.6 million is being provided as an interim response to the Report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. The Government will join with State and Territory Governments in announcing a comprehensive response in March 1992.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, over $3 million will be provided for the operation of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The National Aboriginal Health Strategy will be fully funded when agreements between the Commonwealth and the States are in place. $7 million of further funding is included in the Budget for this purpose for Aboriginal Medical Services as part of the Strategy.
       </para>
       <para>
        To help fight unacceptably high Aboriginal unemployment, Community Development Employment Projects will be further expanded. Under this program, Aboriginal people voluntarily forgo their entitlement to certain social security payments to work on community improvement and development projects.
       </para>
       <para>
        REVENUE
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Speaker, I now turn to the revenue side of the Budget.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is continuing to improve the fairness of Australia's tax system.
       </para>
       <para>
        Currently, some taxpayers who use tax agents are able to delay significantly their tax payments. To stop this, measures will be taken to minimise payment delays.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, the Tax Office will more effectively use information supplied on employment declaration forms to improve compliance with tax obligations by both employers and employees.
       </para>
       <para>
        Taken together, these changes will increase revenue by $350 million in 1991-92.
       </para>
       <para>
        To align better the tax on fringe benefits with taxes on salaries, the Fringe Benefits Tax rate is to increase from April 1992 by 1 1/4%, the equivalent of the Medicare levy rate.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am announcing today broad features of new tax arrangements, to be introduced next year, to remove advantages that some Australian residents obtain through investments in foreign investment funds.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am also releasing further detailed information about the new self assessment arrangements for taxpayers.
       </para>
       <para>
        SUPERANNUATION AND RETIREMENT INCOME
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Speaker, the Government's retirement incomes policy aims to ensure that all Australians have a secure income in retirement. Superannuation is a vital part of that policy and has been an important policy issue throughout the life of this Labor Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        Over the past eight years, major progress has been made in extending the superannuation system in Australia. In 1986, 3% superannuation was awarded by the then Conciliation and Arbitration Commission as part of a productivity and wage package. This award requirement has not been complied with in full.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government will therefore introduce a superannuation guarantee levy, starting from July next year.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government will legislate for a prescribed level of superannuation support to be provided by employers to all of their employees.
       </para>
       <para>
        Employers failing to meet this level will be subject to a superannuation levy which will not be deductible for income tax purposes.
       </para>
       <para>
        To ease the transition for small businesses, the initial level of prescribed support will be 5% of ordinary time earnings for employees of employers whose annual payrolls exceed $500,000; and 3% for other employees.
       </para>
       <para>
        This level will be increased gradually over time. By the year 2000, the prescribed level of employer support will be 9% of earnings. Consideration will also be given to supplementing this level of support with employee contributions and tax cuts equivalent to 3% of earnings.
       </para>
       <para>
        Improvements in superannuation will be taken into account in future Accord negotiations.
       </para>
       <para>
        This new superannuation guarantee levy will underpin the Government's retirement incomes policy. Superannuation will be extended to many Australians for the first time. In addition, an efficient mechanism for the orderly increase in the level of superannuation support over time will be put in place.
       </para>
       <para>
        I shall invite representatives of the ACTU, major employer groups and the superannuation industry to a meeting in September to discuss the implementation of this measure and its implications for the structure of superannuation benefits.
       </para>
       <para>
        Consistent with our support for superannuation, the Government intends to ensure that an adequate prudential framework applies to the superannuation industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am, therefore, releasing today a statement of the Government's policy on prudential supervision of the superannuation industry. As well, there will be additional information disclosure requirements for superannuation funds.
       </para>
       <para>
        WAGES POLICY
       </para>
       <para>
        Sustainable employment growth during the recovery will require continued moderate growth in wages and salaries, and in overall labour costs.
       </para>
       <para>
        The responsibility of unionised workers and the integrity of the Accord process through the 1980s were, tragically, not matched by the behaviour of others in our economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is now recognised that wage outcomes must be more directly linked to improvements in labour productivity.
       </para>
       <para>
        Importantly, the Government, the ACTU and the major employer bodies are all committed to achieving more devolved wage fixation arrangements. All parties are agreed on the need for a more flexible and more decentralised wages system. This is fundamental to improving our productivity performance in this decade and beyond.
       </para>
       <para>
        The next step involves the forthcoming Australian Industrial Relations Commission review of wage principles and the further development of the most appropriate framework to guide the new wage fixation arrangements.
       </para>
       <para>
        STRUCTURAL REFORM
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Speaker, in March of this year the Government acted to change, for the better, Australia's tariff regime and industry policy. As we progressively expose our traded goods industries to international competition, we must also lift the efficiency of the service industries they rely on to world standards.
       </para>
       <para>
        In July the Government achieved agreement with the States on the mutual recognition of regulations and standards, on roads, on rail, on electricity and on government trading enterprises.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is committed to further reform. I am therefore announcing today details of the Industry Commission forward work program. Future references will cover public infrastructure, manufacturing and primary industry policy, government programs and regional policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        ECONOMIC PROSPECTS
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Speaker, looking back over the past year we have witnessed an historic break in inflation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia now has the opportunity to consolidate its position in the ranks of low inflation countries. The Government is determined to lock in the progress on inflation as a basis for sustainable growth in the 1990s.
       </para>
       <para>
        Looking ahead, economic activity is expected to improve during the coming year.
       </para>
       <para>
        The world economic outlook is improving but only slowly.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our task now is to ensure that demand grows less quickly than output so that our current account continues to improve and inflation remains low.
       </para>
       <para>
        Output is expected to grow by 1 1/2% in 1991-92-and by around 3 3/4% over the year.
       </para>
       <para>
        The main expansionary forces in the economy will be a recovery in the housing sector, a gradual pick-up in consumer spending, and changes in stock levels.
       </para>
       <para>
        Exports will also continue to make an important contribution to growth, as they have done for the past two years. The volume of exports is expected to grow by around 5 1/4% in 1991-92, while imports are expected to decline by around 1 1/4%.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a result, our trade in goods and services will move into surplus for the first time in a decade. Further gains will therefore be made in reducing the current account deficit as a proportion of GDP-almost halving it over two years. This brings the welcome prospect that we will begin to stabilise our external debt as a proportion of GDP this year.
       </para>
       <para>
        Inflation is expected to slow further to 3% in 1991-92.
       </para>
       <para>
        The recovery can be expected to contribute to a gradual lift in employment, and a slow fall in unemployment, as the economy gathers strength in 1992.
       </para>
       <para>
        CONCLUSION
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Speaker, there are early signs that an economic recovery is on the way. In recent years, both in Australia and overseas, one common mistake in economic policy has been to fail to see that a recession has passed.
       </para>
       <para>
        Too often, governments have delivered a stimulus to the economy at just the wrong time-just as the economy was on the mend.
       </para>
       <para>
        Growing employment as the pick-up proceeds is what we all want. To achieve this, successful industry reform needs to be integrated with the steady management of macro-economic policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        But it will always be a challenge to ride out the cycles in economic activity. It is safe to predict that the 1990s will be no different in that regard.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a relatively small and open trading nation dependent on commodity exports, we will always have to manage the effects of changing international economic conditions.
       </para>
       <para>
        But we must organise ourselves to benefit from the upswings in world activity-and to respond to the inevitable downswings in a way that minimises the disruption to the Australian economy. With this in mind, this Budget affirms the Government's intention to continue to pursue sustainable longer term policies.
       </para>
       <para>
        This speech has not just been about economic policy. Government and economic management is not some remote clinical exercise. Not every political problem can be reduced to some soluble economic problem.
       </para>
       <para>
        Government is about people. This Budget is about people.
       </para>
       <para>
        The corporate and other excesses of the 1980s are behind us. Partly because of those excesses, the transition to sustainable growth and employment is going to be painful and longer than any of us want.
       </para>
       <para>
        But we now have a firm base for sustainable growth in the period ahead. Our competitiveness has improved, our current account deficit is falling, and the gains on the inflation front will create a sound climate for investor confidence in the coming recovery.
       </para>
       <para>
        The challenge is to build on this base. Your Government is committed to leading Australia through this period, relying as we always do on the strength, resilience and commonsense of the Australian people.
       </para>
       <para>
        I commend the Budget to the House.

        Appropriation Bill (No. 2) seeks appropriations totalling $7,930.1m of the Consolidated Revenue Fund in 1991-92. Of this amount, $3,401.4m was authorised by the Supply Act (No. 2) 1991-92. The balance of $4,528.7m will be authorised by this Bill. The Bill provides for proposed expenditure on the construction of public works and buildings, the acquisition of sites and buildings, certain advances and loans, items of plant and equipment which are clearly definable as capital, and expenditure on new policy initiatives for which legislation has not been approved previously. Provision is also made for grants to the States under section 96 of the Constitution and for payments to the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory.

       <para>
        An amount of $140m is included under the Advance to the Minister for Finance, which is the same amount as was provided in the Supply Act (No. 2) 1991-92.

        The Loan Bill (No. 2) is a machinery financing measure to enable certain defence expenditures to be met from the Loan Fund rather than from the Consolidated Revenue Fund and to supplement the moneys available to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Successive governments have adopted the practice of introducing a Loan Bill to authorise the issue of moneys from the Loan Fund to meet expenditures that have been appropriated by the Parliament but for which insufficient funds are available in the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Legally, expenditure from the Consolidated Revenue Fund cannot exceed the moneys available to that fund. The purpose of this Bill is to make provision for the financing of the prospective 1991-92 Budget deficit.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Budget deficit in prospect for 1991-92 gives rise to a deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund some $5.5 billion greater. This situation arises because appropriations from the fund include various items that I classified as financing transactions, rather than Budget outlays, and thus do not affect the Budget outcome. These items include payments to the National Debt Sinking Fund and superannuation payments made by the Commonwealth on behalf of public trading enterprises.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill provides authority for the Loan Fund to meet Defence expenditures incurred after the passage of the Bill that otherwise would have been met from the Consolidated Revenue Fund and to supplement the Consolidated Revenue Fund so that it can meet its other commitments. The Bill also provides the borrowing authority to cover these payments from the Loan Fund. The Bill does not authorise the expenditures additional to those already appropriated or currently before the Parliament-apart from loan raising expenses, which will be small.
       </para>
       <para>
        I emphasise that the Bill does not in any way impinge upon the prerogative of the Parliament to appropriate public moneys, but simply provides the means to finance expenditures previously approved and appropriated by the Parliament. I commend the Bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.

        The Health Insurance Amendment Bill would enact a number of changes which would be the basis for reforms to ensure that Medicare remains a sustainable, equitable, and efficient universal health insurance system. This Bill would adjust the Medicare benefits arrangements to encourage more appropriate use of medical services and more efficient use of health resources and to provide improved protection for families from high out-of-pocket gap costs for private medical services.
       </para>
       <para>
        The major problem facing Australia's health care system is the growth in use of medical services per person. This growth means that every 20 years the number of medical services per person doubles. That growth is not caused by Medicare. The national health strategy has shown that growth has been occurring fairly constantly since at least 1976. The cause is an open-ended fee for service system underwritten by insurance-whether public or private. The result has been that, as doctors' numbers have grown, so too has the use of medical services.
       </para>
       <para>
        The national health strategy has indicated that an integrated approach that addresses the demand and supply sides together could have a major impact on growth in the use of medical services. That is what the Government proposes. Details are set out in Budget Related Paper No. 9 that has been tabled this afternoon. This Bill would implement the first parts of the package of measures the Government envisages. Further measures will be discussed with the medical profession over coming months-with the Government intending to implement changed benefit arrangements from 1 July 1992.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill would amend the Health Insurance Act 1973 in order to: reduce rebates for selected attendances by general practitioners and permit patient charges on bulk billed claims for the same services; expand the Medicare safety net, and to permit gap costs for families to count towards the existing safety net threshold of $246 indexed; and provide for the indexation of certain sums in the Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        Medicare benefit for prescribed out of hospital general practitioner consultation items for non-concessionary benefits would be reduced by $3.50 from 1 November 1991. This reduction would increase to $5 from 1 November 1992 and be indexed annually from then on. For bulkbilled services, where the rebate is reduced, general practitioners would be able to charge non-concessionary patients a co-payment of up to $3.50. The items affected would be prescribed in regulations and would be the following items: all vocationally registered general practitioner items for consultations in the surgery, home visits, and consultations in institutions and nursing homes; all parallel consultation items for attendances by other than vocationally registered general practitioners; emergency after-hour attendances; and GP attendances involving acupuncture.
       </para>
       <para>
        The benefits for other items in the Medicare benefits schedule are unchanged by this Bill. There would be exemptions from these changes for a range of concessional beneficiaries and, in most cases, their dependants and for those persons and families who become eligible for increased benefits in any year under the safety net arrangements. Concessional beneficiaries are similar to those under the pharmaceutical benefits arrangements but will also extend to those persons entitled to medical care under sections 85 and 86 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986.
       </para>
       <para>
        The following concessional beneficiaries and their dependants would be exempt: social security and veterans' affairs pensioners, including those persons who have retained some entitlements under the deeming provisions for savings introduced in the 1990 Budget; social security beneficiaries; persons receiving family allowance supplement in respect of a child; disadvantaged persons under the Health Insurance Act and pensioners within the meaning of the National Health Act. Persons with treatment entitlements under the Veterans' Entitlements Act would also be exempt but this exemption will not extend to their dependants.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Parliament is currently separately considering the Social Security (Disability and Sickness Support) Amendment Bill 1991, which aims to replace the sheltered employment allowance, the rehabilitation allowance and the invalid pension with the disability support pension and to replace sickness benefit with sickness allowance from 12 November 1991. If this Bill is passed consequential amendments will be made to the Health Insurance Act as necessitated by the social security legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill deals with new safety net arrangements which are designed to protect families and individuals from excessive medical costs. Currently individuals who incur out of pocket costs for gaps between the Medicare benefit and the schedule fee for out of hospital services totalling more than $246, indexed, in a financial year are entitled to benefits to cover their gap costs up to 100 per cent of the schedule fee for out of hospital services for the remainder of the financial year. The threshold would in future apply to gap expenses incurred by a family as a whole rather than by each individual member of the family. The definition of a family would be that currently used for the safety net applying in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Enrolling as a family would be voluntary. Current safety net arrangements would not change for persons who are not members of families and anyone who chooses not to be counted as part of a family.
       </para>
       <para>
        From 1 January 1992 the safety net year would change from the existing financial year to a calendar year basis. This would ensure the extra protection applies as soon as practicable. It would also bring the arrangements into line with those which apply to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The safety net threshold would remain at its current level of $246 for 1992 and would be indexed thereafter annually. The level would be the same for both individuals and families.
       </para>
       <para>
        This represents a substantial improvement in protection for families. Under the current arrangements some families continue to pay gap costs for out of hospital services for some family members even when one or more members have exceeded the threshold figure. The new arrangements should bring relief to those families where one or more members have a chronic condition or who face unexpectedly high costs because of sudden serious illness in the family. The change would reduce the maximum costs for out of hospital private medical services of a couple with two children from $984 to $246 a year where their doctors charge schedule fees or less. Regulations would provide transitional arrangements for the change from financial to calendar years. The transitional arrangements would involve introducing a calendar year basis for the existing individual safety net retrospectively from 1 January 1991.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Health Insurance Commission would recalculate the totals of individuals' patient contributions back to 1 January 1991 and then apply the current threshold of $246. Retrospective adjustments would be made, where necessary, to claims already processed for individuals who achieve the safety net threshold under this transitional arrangement. People who received increased benefits after reaching the threshold in the period 1 July 1990 to 30 June 1991 would not be required to repay those benefits.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill would also provide for indexation of the following: the maximum gap between the schedule fee and the Medicare benefit; the safety net threshold; and the reduction to benefit for the prescribed GP services. Both the maximum gap and safety net threshold are indexed under current legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clearly there are serious concerns about the cost to the community and the quality of care provided in general practice. The Government will be entering into discussions with the medical profession to see how funding arrangements might be further amended to assist the profession in its appropriate role of improving standards of practice. The aim of the discussions will be to enable both the profession and the Government to pursue their legitimate roles while ensuring that there is a greater synthesis between the two. It is the responsibility of the profession to set and supervise standards. It is the responsibility of the Government to ensure the financing mechanisms permit access to necessary medical services while constraining costs to ensure the long term sustainability of Medicare and assisting the profession to provide high quality care.
       </para>
       <para>
        Discussions with the profession will centre around the following: firstly, the use of practice grants to complement fee for service reimbursement. A practice grant would provide some remuneration to those general practices which choose to reduce their reliance on fee for service. This would better target health benefits since it would offer appropriate financial incentives for practices to engage in best practice care, provide financing arrangements to encourage better integration with the health system and to involve general practitioners in a wider range of activities. These could be funded through a trade-off between providing funds for practice grants and providing funds for schedule fee increases for GPs' services.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, there is trialling of the use of practice budgets. Under this arrangement a budget is allocated to general practices to cover the costs of diagnostic services and pharmaceuticals. This could build on the Government's other reforms in pharmaceuticals, pathology and radiology. It could also facilitate the trade-offs which general practitioners make between different approaches to the care of their patients and support the role of the general practitioner as the coordinator of a network of care. It would be a different approach from that at the moment, which relies on counselling by the Health Insurance Commission for doctors who, by comparison with their peers, appear to use excessive amounts of these services.
       </para>
       <para>
        Thirdly, there is the accreditation of general practices. The Government sees this as a natural development of the vocational registration arrangements. Those arrangements are a form of accreditation, but of individual practitioners. Accreditation would be a matter for the profession, but it could provide a framework within which many steps could be taken to address quality of care issues in general practice. These might include improved quality of training provided to general practice trainees through links between accredited practice and academic departments of general practice in medical schools. Similarly improved continuing education and quality assurance programs could result from these links.
       </para>
       <para>
        Fourthly, there is the supply and distribution of medical practitioners. There are four major aspects for discussion. These are: medical immigration; output of medical schools; the distribution of medical practitioners; and developing alternatives for general practitioners to help reduce the oversupply problem in urban areas. Many other countries have acted to deal with excessive medical immigration. The situation in Australia is now such that it can no longer afford to permit relatively unrestricted entry of overseas medical practitioners.
       </para>
       <para>
        Fifthly, there is information technology. Information technology could substantially enhance the diagnostic and patient education roles of general practitioners as well as improving the business management of practices. However, as with other diagnostic equipment, the current structures of general practice mean that few practices have sufficient capital base to provide these facilities.
       </para>
       <para>
        Over $400,000 has been provided in the 1991-92 Budget to support the work of the review of professional indemnity arrangements for health care professionals. The review, established by me in April 1991, will examine and report on current arrangements relating to professional indemnity insurance for health care professionals. It will also examine current experience with compensation for medical misadventure and any difficulties with these current arrangements including problems with service quality, coverage and benefits.
       </para>
       <para>
        The review will prepare a discussion paper, undertake widespread consultations and prepare a final report, with recommendations for reform, for consideration by the Government in the context of the 1992-93 Budget. The resources provided in the 1991-92 Budget will enable the review to prepare its discussion paper, develop options, undertake national consultations, conduct a number of research projects and develop sound costings for possible reform options.
       </para>
       <para>
        Reform of arrangements for compensation for medical misadventure could assist doctors to improve significantly the quality of care to patients while avoiding unnecessary diagnostic costs which arise from the practice of defensive medicine.
       </para>
       <para>
        Conclusion
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        I reiterate that this Bill is to enact a number of changes designed to ensure that Medicare remains a sustainable, equitable, and efficient universal health insurance system. It is the first step in addressing difficulties that exist not so much in our health insurance system as in our health care system. I look forward to the cooperation of the medical profession in addressing these difficult and complex issues. I commend this Bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.

       <para>
        As announced by the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) in the 1991-92 Budget today, this Bill will amend the wholesale sales tax law to change the current exemptions for certain goods and motor vehicles for use by people with disabilities. The Government has already made decisions on the Industry Commission report on aids and appliances for people with disabilities. The measures in this Bill deal with the sales tax issues considered in the report. The Bill implements the majority of the Industry Commission proposals, but with some variation in detail and extension. These measures demonstrate the Government's concern that the taxation treatment of goods for use by people with disabilities be both equitable and responsible.

       <para>
        Goods used in modifications of motor vehicles
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the current sales tax law, exemption is only available for goods used to modify a motor vehicle to adapt it for driving by a person suffering from a physical disability. The Bill will significantly widen this exemption to include goods used to modify new or second-hand motor vehicles to transport a person suffering from a physical disability. This exemption will assist those who are required to modify their vehicles solely for the purpose of transporting a family member, relative or friend who is suffering from a physical disability.
       </para>
       <para>
        Goods designed and manufactured expressly for people with disabilities
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        The current sales tax law exempts goods designed and manufactured expressly for people suffering from sickness, disease or disablement. However, the law also requires that exemption only applies if these goods are not ordinarily used by people with no such disabilities. The Bill removes this second requirement. This will simplify and improve the clarity of the law. Goods presently exempt under the provision will remain exempt. However, it will no longer be necessary for manufacturers and distributors of these goods to know how likely it is that the goods will be used by other people.
       </para>
       <para>
        Exemption for certain new motor vehicles
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill will place a limit on the sales tax exemptions available for new motor vehicles for use by certain Defence Force veterans and other people with specific disabilities. The current exemptions are completely open-ended, and those most able to afford expensive new motor vehicles are able to derive greater benefits than those with less income. The Bill will ensure greater equity in this area by providing that a maximum sales tax benefit, or `cap', will apply to all new vehicles purchased under these exemptions.
       </para>
       <para>
        Sales tax exemption will be limited to motor vehicles with a wholesale sale value equal to or less than the current `luxury' motor vehicle sale value threshold of $30,505. This corresponds to a retail list price of $45,462, and is the amount above which sales tax on motor vehicles is now payable at 30 per cent. Where the sale value of the vehicle exceeds the threshold, the vehicle will be taxable. However, tax will be payable on a reduced sale value. This will produce a benefit equal to the amount of sales tax that would have been payable if the vehicle had been priced on the threshold.

The net cost of the proposed changes will be $3m for 1991-92 and $3.5m in a full year. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and I commend the Bill to the House.

        World agricultural trade is basically corrupt. Export subsidies and unfair import restrictions are only the most obvious manifestations of the impediments to a fair go in international trade for our export commodities. The biggest losers from this corruption are the farmers of Australia and New Zealand-they are the least assisted and the most efficient-and, beyond that, the economies of Australia and New Zealand. Let every Australian be aware that the problem of corrupt agricultural trade is not just one for the farmers and the exporters of this country; it concerns all Australians, because their standard of living is less than it should be and could be as a result.
       </para>
       <para>
        We now have a situation where our farmers have not only depressed incomes but even negative incomes-an unbelievably dismal situation compared to those in the ordinary work force, or those who were in the ordinary work force and are now on unemployment benefits. Even this Budget does not allow a farmer with basically no income to obtain some sort of income support. This comes at a time when the farmers of this country should be well off in terms of their efficiency relative to that of their competitors in other countries.
       </para>
       <para>
        The situation internationally for agriculture is far worse than for manufacturing trade because the GATT does not really cover agriculture. When the present regime was established in the postwar period, the main trading countries of the world ensured that there were exclusions and grandfather clauses, which meant, basically, that agriculture did not come within the compass of the fairer trade that is there for manufacturing industry; hence the overriding importance of the success of the Uruguay Round because it will bring agricultural trade within the same context as manufacturing trade.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those countries that are the main offenders, particularly the European Community and the United States but also countries such as Japan, which have been the main beneficiaries of the liberalised fairer trading arrangements for manufacturing goods but have unfairly protective arrangements for their agriculture, have endeavoured to rationalise their double standard in international trade by first of all saying that it is necessary for their food security. However, if they really looked at their production patterns in agriculture they would recognise that they are not gaining food security because of the need to import greater amounts of fertiliser for their crops and feed grains for their livestock. It is really a false feeling about food security.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second rationalisation is that there is something symbolic about a particular agricultural policy or commodity. I think the best-or worst-example of that is rice in Japan, and to a lesser extent in Taiwan, where it is seen as a core of their policy and, following on from that, a policy of maintaining people in the country because it is good to maintain people in the country. We would all sympathise with that here because rural Australia is being depopulated, but there are better, cheaper and more targeted ways of maintaining people in the country in Europe and elsewhere through direct income support.
       </para>
       <para>
        The third rationalisation is that it is good for conservation. This is the particular argument in the European Community. That in itself is a contradictory argument. Because of the more intensive agriculture that has been encouraged by high support levels, there are problems of intensive animal production with greater pollution. Secondly, there are nitrate and other fertiliser pollution problems because of their more intensive cropping.
       </para>
       <para>
        This situation has built up over the last two to three decades. If one looks at the European Community, as the main instigator of this situation through its common agricultural policy, it has changed from being an importer to being self-sufficient to being a dumped exporter of many commodities. This is built around the double subsidy policy; that is, firstly, a policy of domestic inputs, of price supports to encourage domestic production at a cost far above an international market price. Because they do have that excess production and sometimes reduced domestic consumption, they then need an export subsidy to get rid of the product overseas. That is where the real problem begins for us. In Europe that covers grain, sugar, a whole range of processed horticultural products such as deciduous canned fruit, tomatoes, et cetera, dairy and beef.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, the European Community has a whole range of formal and informal import restrictions which we would see as unfair. Firstly, there is the level of the common external tariff. Secondly, there are quotas-amazingly restrictive quotas for the size of the market in the EC-for cheese and lamb and beef of just a few thousand tonnes a year. If that is not enough, the Europeans then apply informal restrictions. In other words, if a person is in the canned fruit industry in Australia, they talk to him. They do not want him to export more than a certain product in a year at other than a certain price. They lean on him. I know they do not do that just for agriculture; cars might be another example. Those are the restrictions that the Europeans impose. To pay for the burgeoning cost of their common agricultural policy, which is about two-thirds of the total expenditure of the EC budget, they have had to increase their VAT.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is only half the story for the EC. Each of the countries that makes up the EC also heavily subsidises at the national level. If one really gets the true figure for the degree of subsidisation in the EC, it is approaching double the official figure from the EC. The point we make is that there is a better way and it is urgent that that be addressed by the Europeans.
       </para>
       <para>
        If one looks at the United States and its farm Bills, the array of support is not as comprehensive as for the Europeans or as severe or generous, depending on which side of the trade fence one is on, in export assistance. For many of their products or commodities there is still the same double standard as the Europeans. That is, they have the double subsidy, target prices, loan rates, ways of increasing domestic production, and then export subsidies to sell the surplus products and very severe import restrictions.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think in particular of the dairy industry, the sugar industry, the rice industry, the cotton industry, the peanut industry, the grain industry and, to a lesser extent when one looks at import restrictions, the beef industry and other forms of support for the wool industry. Until 1985 the United States concentrated on `set aside' programs under the farm Bills. They claim-and I think it is true-that particularly for grain production they lost market share internationally. They are determined to regain that market share through the export enhancement program.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to make the point that we should not just think that EEP is the only export subsidy arrangement of the United States. They have DEIP, the dairy export improvement program, which has no budgetary limit whatsoever. They had another one called TEAP, the targeted export assistance program. This program, which is now called the market promotion program, has a $200m budget. This means that the US taxpayer pays for beef promotion in Japan. In Australia, it is the beef producer who pays for beef promotion in Japan. On top of that, the United States has the Commodity Credit Corporation and public law 480 disposal programs which mean that if nothing else works they give the stuff away.
       </para>
       <para>
        The problem of international trade corruption is most severe in the grain industry. This problem is escalating. We have seen recent examples of this in Yemen, Kuwait and Egypt. It is not, of course, only the EEC and the United States. Saudi Arabia now has a surplus as a result of its artificial support system for encouraging grain production. We now see that New Zealand is within that country's sights. Other countries are also engaged in this practice with other commodities. Thailand and Norway are two other examples. A number of socialist or ex-socialist countries which need hard currency are also involved.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is a desperate situation for our wheatgrowers. We acknowledge that we cannot match the level that prevails in other countries. The latest figures show that Australia is the second lowest after New Zealand in terms of assistance generally to farmers. Once the debt on the wool loan is repaid, that assistance at 4 to 5 per cent will be lower than that of New Zealand and will compare with support levels in Japan and some other countries of up to 60 to 70 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a need for this Government to be more aggressive in the presentation of Australia's case. Australia should be given back some of the share that it had in the Taiwanese wheat market. We should be more aggressive in respect of South Africa. We should be aggressive in terms of CER and the Saudi proposal in New Zealand. Also, there should have been better compensation for Australia in respect of the Gulf crisis. Basically, only the wheatgrowers of this country paid any penalty for our involvement.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a need for people at the highest level to do something. This means that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Evans) should at every opportunity take the message to Europe, the United States and Japan. I mention Japan because that country has been the major beneficiary of a freer world trading environment. But as far as I can see, it is not taking any positive role with regard to its own unacceptable level of restrictions. That is also the case in respect of a number of other Asian countries that have benefited from manufacturing liberalism-and I mention here Korea, Taiwan et cetera-but which still have very restrictive and unfair agricultural policies.
       </para>
       <para>
        Time is running out. The Prime Minister indicated today that by April or May of next year the United States presidential election will have taken over the running and the 12-month extension of the fast track by Congress will have run out. The European Community must make more significant and genuine changes to its common agricultural policy. The Europeans know that there are other ways in which they can achieve support for their smaller farmers. That is why it is important that representations at the highest level be made by Australia to the European Community.
       </para>
       <para>
        I acknowledge that it is important that representatives of this Parliament go to Europe. We have been to the United States. There is a need for balance. It is important that we take the message to both of the major promoters, supporters and users in this most unfair situation at present. If, in addition to the Europeans putting forward more realistic proposals than they have up until now, the United States does not respond, the cynicism of many Australians in relation to their views about a second agenda of the United States to gain market share irrespective of which country is hurt will gain credence and that will certainly not be to the benefit of the relationship between rural Australia and the United States.
       </para>
       <para>
        The final point that I want to make is that this problem is of such gravity and significance that it must be taken up by all Australians. While members of the Opposition have told the Government what we believe could have been done better, and still can be done better, we nevertheless give bipartisan support to the overall requirement for fair trade in international agricultural products.

         —I am pleased to join in the debate. I was pleased to hear the contribution that was made by the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd). The honourable member effectively said-and I accept and adopt this-that we need to persist with more vigour the approach upon which the Government has already set its course. In that regard, it is pleasing to see that he did not suggest in his contribution that we should ban US airlines, as has been put forward by others on the other side of the Parliament. He did not say that we should storm US bases or re-enter the price subsidy war. In our view, if we resort, as a result of anger and concern, simply to making threats, to taking our eye off the ball and to taking away the advantage that has been created by all of the effort that has been put in by this Government with the support, in many respects, of a bipartisan House, the reality is that we would lose the opportunity and initiative that we have established to date.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Our strategy is two-fold. On the one hand, it is to try to get access; to get a reduction in the subsidies that are limiting the ability of our competitive farmers to get in and sell their product. On the other hand, it is to recognise the immediate problem and to give some form of relief. I will come to each of those strategies in turn.
       </para>
       <para>
        The strategy of trying to get access is fundamental for this very reason: in my view, farm Australia and, for that matter, mining Australia, has done everything right. It has become competitive. At the same time it has become productive. It has invested research and development dollars and it is amongst the most efficient producers of commodities in the world. But that is not enough. The combination of barriers to entry, which the Deputy Leader of the National Party mentioned, and the crazy price subsidy war simply means that no matter how good we are, we cannot get in. That is why it is so important not just to ensure that there is a successful outcome in the GATT Round in relation to agriculture but to ensure that there is a successful outcome in relation to all other activities.
       </para>
       <para>
        If my view is right that we have the opportunity-and I gave this response today to a question-for the first time really to better link efficient manufacturing with efficient primary production, we are going to need access in other markets as well. That is why, as important as agriculture is, it is also important to adopt an access approach. We need to see the dropping of subsidies and the other sorts of barriers that exist not just in respect of agriculture but also at all levels. If we succeed, we will not just directly benefit agriculture-agriculture will benefit indirectly as well.
       </para>
       <para>
        The approach has been very much focused on the multilateral round-the Uruguay Round. Do not underestimate the significance of the position that Australia has played itself into. Farm groups and the community are frustrated that the United States is not really interested in us, that we are too small. That is so. But the reality is that because of the initiative that this Government took forming the Cairns Group and giving it leadership, we have effectively established a veto capacity in relation to the Uruguay Round. And that is a very important weapon for us. There will not be a successful outcome in the Uruguay Round if there is not a successful outcome in agriculture. That is accepted. It is known. We have played that card and we have played it well.
       </para>
       <para>
        We cannot afford to lose that opportunity by making all sorts of irrational threats and saying, `It is time for us now, because all else has failed, to give the game away before the final siren has blown and re-enter the subsidy war and therefore take pressure off those that we are trying to have eradicate or dismantle their tariff protection'. As I said, I am pleased to see that the Opposition today-I will wait and see what comes in the rest of the debate-is not saying that we should change tack. I commend the Opposition for that. I think the most crazy thing for us to do now would be to blow the opportunity we have created. I accept that, if it fails, of course everything else is on the table. We have to really go back to the drawing board and consider our position. But the reality is that we are, to use the football parlance, in the final quarter; we have a reasonable chance of winning and we cannot afford to blow it by taking our eyes off the ball.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe the reason we have the opportunity to make some progress is that, despite the stalling of the GATT Round of talks-the Uruguay Round-there have been some encouraging recent signs, such as the commitment by the G7 leaders-the leaders of the most powerful economic nations in the world-to personally involve themselves if there is a stalemate. That is why I think it is a cheap shot for the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) to suggest that our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) lead this next delegation. We have got to see the delegation to Europe this time putting pressure on counterpart Ministers and when it is appropriate to use the Prime Minister to go to his equivalents, not to his juniors. That is why the Leader of the Opposition, in my view, just does not think through the approach that this Government has adopted and destroys the basis for the bipartisan approach that we have been pursuing.
       </para>
       <para>
        The reality is that the mission needs to adopt the same strategy as we have been pursuing in a multilateral sense in bilateral focus. That is what we did in the United States last week. People criticised those negotiations. They criticised them because they said we did not get terribly much out of them. I think that is probably true, but it is also true to say that the negotiations themselves did provide a constructive basis for really continuing to hammer the point in a bilateral sense. That is because we have an agreement from the President of the United States. Many question whether that agreement is being honoured, and I am one of those who question it. I accept the argument that in the main America's utilisation of the export enhancement program is a response to the Europeans, but I do not accept it in relation to the wheat sale to the Yemen. That is where I think the Americans have been found out, because when it turns on the facts they were not following European Community sales into Yemen; they were different market segments that were supplied by Europe into the Yemen-red wheat for reprocessing and export, not white wheat that we and the Americans compete for.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that point was solidly brought home to the Americans in the talks last week, and I believe that they have come to realise that, if they are going to honour their commitment not to disrupt our market but at the same time recognise or justify that they are having to follow the EC subsidy madness, at least they will be prepared to consider the full ramifications next time round. I believe it is an issue upon which we have to build. We have further opportunities in a bilateral sense to so build, and one of those opportunities of course is the visit by the President of the United States to this country later this year. Again, I think the important point is: start to see something constructive in the approach rather than just merely criticise it, and also understand where the real problem lies. We hear all the criticism from the other side of the House about the US but very little about Europe.

         —We were the ones who called in the heads of governments. I do acknowledge that the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) has been even handed in his approach. I must say that the approach has not been as even handed when it comes to criticism by the National Party, but I accept that the honourable member for Mayo has always drawn attention to the fact that the EC is the core and the base of the problem. That is certainly the view I start from. That is why we called the European ambassadors in a week or so ago and that is why we are proposing this mission to Europe. We will have the other opportunity, with the visit next month at our invitation of the French Minister for agriculture, to take up the issue because the French are a major part of the problem.

        There have been encouraging results in the GATT Round: the Dunkel initiative by the General Secretary of the GATT and his proposal, the proposal by MacSharry as chair of the agricultural group in the EC for reform of the common agricultural policy, and, as I said before, the commitment by heads of nations in the G7 to become personally involved. So I make the point that it is very important for this Parliament-not just as a result of today's discussion, but this is an important part of it-using all the vigour, drive and energy that we can muster, to ensure in a multilateral approach as well as in every available bilateral approach that we hammer the point home, because in my view our position is right. We do have a solid logical position. We are finding intransigence, but in the final analysis I believe that if we persist hard enough, if we pursue it hard enough and if we demonstrate the futility of the situation we will get our point home.
       </para>
       <para>
        The height of madness was demonstrated this week. I thought it was absolutely crazy to have a situation in which a European nation was subsidising wheat to the tune of $US100 a tonne when it could sell it for only $US75 a tonne into China; but that was capped extraordinarily by the example of the Saudis, who are prepared to subsidise by up to $US620 per tonne. In my view it is economic madness and unsustainable economically. Those countries may be able to be convinced for a short time by their rural core that they need to maintain and persist, but it is something that the rest of the taxpayers of those countries have to bear-an extraordinary cost for what can be got more efficiently, more cheaply and with a cleaner produce, in my view, by opening up the opportunities and, as a result of opening up those opportunities themselves as more wealthy nations, being able to take advantage of manufacture and re-export and get trade going in a proper global sense. I think that argument must win in the end; if it does not, the GATT does not stand for anything.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having said that, I was also interested to notice that the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Lloyd) said that there was nothing in this Budget to provide for the families who are hard pressed as a result of many things, including this inability to get their product in to markets. I draw the attention of the Deputy Leader of the National Party to the detail of the Budget. What we have tried to do in this Budget is this: we have tried to come to grips for the first time with this problem in rural Australia whereby people are asset rich on paper and cannot realise or borrow against the asset but are income poor. Some are even income negative. The proposal in the Budget is to create an entitlement to a family allowance supplement of $26.50 a week for each child under 13 and $38.65 a week for kids between 13 and 15 years; an entitlement to family allowance supplement for people whose net assets are not $347,500, as is currently the exclusion mark, but $600,000. That is a particular provision family allowance supplement.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is true that an assets test has been introduced in relation to the family allowance, but the asset test will be waived where people are income poor. The income poor threshold is the same gate of entry for both family allowance and family allowance supplement: it is the unemployment benefit adjusted for kids-about $14,500-and a liquid assets test.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think that that is a proper recognition of real need-real need for farm families who are struggling, who are not getting the income, and about whom there is created this false impression of wealth because they happen to be struck out as a result of not meeting an assets test. It has been only this Government-not just in relation to the rural sector on this occasion but also on other occasions-which has specifically targeted and identified the needs, and provided for those real needs, in particular, of the families of those struggling farmers. In addition, under the rural adjustment scheme there is $100m extra-a total now of $160m, which now underwrites up to $1.4 billion in rural debt. If we were not doing that, imagine the fire sales that would be going on in rural Australia now. People would be selling off the farm because they could not meet their debts.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those measures demonstrate a government that expresses and understands the immediate concern and is prepared to do something about it-not just vent anger, not just mouth slogans, but actually do something. (Time expired)

         —The Government in this whole debate on corrupted international trade has, I think quite effectively, diverted attention from the causes of the collapse of rural Australia which relate to domestic economic management. Whilst the Government's arguments are perfectly justified and entirely defensible, the whole process of making a gigantic issue out of the European Community and the United States must not hide from the public and from rural Australia the enormous structural inefficiencies which lie within our own economy through a lack of proper industrial relations reform, a lack of micro-economic reform and a lack of proper taxation reform, which simply have compounded the problems of rural Australia. So I start by saying that people should not lose sight of the damage we have done to ourselves in this country and, in particular, to rural Australia through negligent Government policies.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) talked at some length about the United States and the European Community, and much of what he says I strongly agree with. There is no doubt that the collapse of rural Australia-and, if we look at it over a long time, it is a collapse over a 20-year period-has been partly caused by the policies of the European Community and, to a much lesser extent, the policies of the United States. We just have to look at the hideous story of European Community subsidies to understand what has happened.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1989, from the latest OECD figures available, European Community taxpayers spent $44 billion-that is nearly half of the total Australian Budget-simply subsidising their 10 million farmers; and European consumers spent another $54 billion in consumer transfers, once again to support the European farmer. In total, in 1989, 10 million European farmers received through consumer transfers and taxes $98 billion. Compare that with the GDP of Indonesia: there are 179 million people in Indonesia and it has a GDP of $91 billion. So the total wealth of Indonesia, with 179 million people, is less than the amount of subsidy that the Europeans provided for their 10 million farmers. I think that is a miserable story. That money is simply used to prop up Disneyland farms all over Europe which bear very little relationship to economic reality. The United States is not as bad, but the story is not too good either. Its taxpayers spent in the same year $46 billion and its consumers $21 billion, making a total of nearly $68 billion simply to support farmers.
       </para>
       <para>
        But the consequence of these policies has been overproduction and a reduction, therefore, in international prices. Countries like Australia, which are efficient producers, and many developing countries struggling to make ends meet are being closed altogether out of the markets in particular of Europe. When in 1973 Britain joined the European Community, the Europeans told us that we had to go off and find new markets-and we did. It was pretty hard work, but we did. But the Europeans have the audacity years later to come along not only and block us altogether out of their market, which was the consequence of British entry in 1973, but also to dump their artificially produced surpluses on to those very new markets that we went out to find. That is the most insulting thing that Europe has done to this country since 1788, and it is something that all Australians feel very strongly and very bitterly about. Europeans ought to understand that, although history shows that they do not care too much.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1990 the Europeans spent $10 billion on export subsidies alone. I know that the Americans spent money on export subsidies as well, but we should remember that they spent only one tenth of what the Europeans spent on similar subsidies. We have had since 1971-72, when the negotiations on Britain's entry into the European Community took place, a dialogue of the death with Brussels. It always reruns the same lines: `We are doing something; just wait and see next year'-but it never happens-and `Agriculture is terribly special to us', as if it is not special to Australia. Let us face it: at the end of the day, they slip off back to their expensive restaurants up the fine tree-lined boulevards of Brussels saying behind them, `We do not really care about Australia, we do not care about efficient agricultural countries and we do not care about developing countries'. Everybody knows that the common agricultural policy is ridiculous nonsense and European politicians, particularly those outside Britain and the Netherlands, are politically pusillanimous; they do not have the guts to address the issue and at the end of the day they just do not care. Their selfish indifference is as great as the indifference to human welfare of nineteenth century British mill owners. Their behaviour is just disgraceful.

        The American Administration, to give it some credit, believes that its export enhancement program may be a weapon that will break down at least the worst features of the European Community's common agricultural policy. I must say that I doubt whether that is the view of the United States Department of Agriculture; I think it finds the export enhancement program a convenient way of building up its market share. It does not care too much about Australia suffering from that. But I know the USTR cares, I know the State Department cares and I am sure the White House cares about the collateral damage imposed on Australia by the export enhancement program. So do many members of Congress.

        Our bipartisan trade delegation, which went in March of this year to the United States, had some very minimal measure of success in that we were able to negotiate this consultative process which was initially designed so the Americans could let us know whether they were going to impose on our markets and so we could tell them we were concerned about what they were going to do. The reality is that the piece of paper setting up the agreement on the consultations was completed by the end of May and the Australian Government, through a process of delay and, frankly, bureaucratic bungling and indifference, did not enable those consultations to come into play until 2 1/2 months later.
       </para>
       <para>
        So, whilst I agree with what the Minister says about the Yemen-and also, one should add, the Chinese and Philippine markets and the Americans' behaviour in those markets-if we had had the consultative process set up as quickly as possible, which the Australian Government did not facilitate, we could have avoided some of those problems and got the consultative process going in a more mature way than it is going even now.
       </para>
       <para>
        What else can we do? I know Australians feel very frustrated about this whole issue. We say on this side of the House, as the Government says, `We should not get into the export subsidies game ourselves because all we will do is spend taxpayers' money on those subsidies, and the Europeans and the Americans will just up their subsidies; we will not get any greater market share and taxpayers' money will be wasted'. Some people say, `Why not kick the American bases, or the joint facilities, out of Australia or charge massive amounts of rent?'. I say we should keep things in perspective. The defence of this country is the first priority of any government and the United States alliance is fundamental to the defence of this country; we should not be playing around with that and certainly not by way of political gimmicks.
       </para>
       <para>
        The bipartisan missions have some potential for success, but the one to the United States was limited because of the absence of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), and we sincerely believe that the presence of the Prime Minister and of the Leader of the Opposition in Europe next month would be a great boost to Australia's whole profile in the community and in trying to get some measure of concession from the Europeans, particularly in the context of the Uruguay Round. The only thing the Hawke Government-and I am not really criticising it by saying this-has managed to get out of the selfish European Community on farm trade is the Andriesson agreement on beef exports into Asia and particularly Japan. That was negotiated in 1985, when the Prime Minister went to Brussels, and is the only measure of agreement we have been able to get.

        The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy makes the point that we are a small country. That is all the more reason to send our Prime Minister and our Leader of the Opposition: to make a greater impact than Ministers and shadow Ministers. In July even the Prime Minister apparently recognised this argument, but when the Keating challenge came along he abandoned his visit to Europe, it never to re-emerge. He now says that it is inappropriate for him to go to Europe. How come it was appropriate in July? I know why it is inappropriate-and we all know why it is inappropriate-for the Prime Minister to go now. It is inappropriate because he will be knifed off while he is away, as somebody said to me in the dining room today-I will not say who it was-in the manner that President Gorbachev was done over. Finally, we agree with the Government that the Uruguay Round is the main game. Every last effort must be put into achieving success in that forum. (Time expired)

         —The next few months will be a watershed for Australian agriculture, and it will hinge on the outcome of the Uruguay Round. There is no doubt that there is frustration in the bush, there is frustration in provincial cities and there is frustration amongst politicians as we, the nation of some 18 million people, try to talk sense into the great trading bloc of the European Community-some 350 million people-and the United States, a colossus with some 250 million people.

        There has been criticism that change has come too slow, but what we have to recognise is that change will come only if we are able to articulate and debate and get a willingness of movement by these two super trading blocs. We cannot achieve that on our own. If we were to go back down the road of protection, a suggestion that a handful of illiterate commentators, such as a Mr Herbert in the Sunday Mail, and a few opportunist politicians in provincial Queensland have put forward, that would simply destroy all the gains that we have made. But worse than that, the 80 per cent of our farm product that we export overseas would simply sit on the wharves, because Australian agriculture depends upon gaining access to world markets.
       </para>
       <para>
        I hope, as I am sure all honourable members on both sides of the House do, that we can expand our agricultural products, that we can expand our farm product; but in doing so we need to find markets. Over the last few decades Europe has gone from a net importer of food products to being self-sufficient, and, worse still, is becoming an exporter and dumping those products on traditional markets that we had worked for after Britain gave up empire preference. As previous speakers have said, once we found that Europe was being closed to us we worked very hard to find markets for our products-only to find that the Europeans are now dumping into those markets.
       </para>
       <para>
        I guess one could understand a Third World country having an opportunity to buy cheaper commodities being influenced to buy those subsidised European products instead of our farm products. On any level playing field Australian farmers are the best in the world, and all we have ever asked for is a fair go. At the present time the EC's protection cost Australian wheat and grain producers almost $700m in 1990-91. Of that, some $430m was a loss to the wheat industry alone. The export enhancement program in the United States cost us between $125m and $175m in the same year.
       </para>
       <para>
        I agree with one of the previous speakers; I totally oppose the EEP; I think it is economic madness. However, it has a tenth of the effect on us that the Europeans have. There is no doubt that what the United States is doing is harming us-and I am opposed to that-but the real culprits in this whole protection affair are the Europeans. It is ironic that the very countries that gave birth to this nation-the Europeans-are now trying to suffocate us. As the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) says, since 1788 they have done very little for us and they are now, out of ignorance and selfishness, trying to destroy our whole farm base. It would do the French, Belgian and Dutch people good to drive past places like Villers Bretonneux, Tremouilles, Passchendaele, Ypres and Verdun and see the names of Australians who are laid to rest in war cemeteries and who fought so the people in those countries could have a decent way of life. They are entitled to a decent way of life, but they are not entitled to destroy our way of life. We have never had Europeans coming to the defence of this country as we have gone to the defence of Europe, and it is a great pity that they have forgotten that. We need to remind them of it over and over again.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a small light at the end of the tunnel-and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) has mentioned this in his speech-in that, during their London summit last month, the G7 leaders said that they would look very closely at the agricultural outcome. We have to hope that they will. If we look at every great catastrophe and human conflict in history, we see that it started basically as a result either of greed on the part of one country wanting to take over another or of corrupted trade practices. Most of the wars that have been fought in the last 300 years have basically been trade wars.
       </para>
       <para>
        Regarding the EEP, it is important to quote from probably the greatest President of the United States this century, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He said this:
       </para>
       <para>
        In our world problems, we must either shut our eyes . . . crush utterly by embargo and harassing legislation our foreign trade . . . or, we must open our eyes and see that modern civilisation has become so complex and the lives of civilised man so interwoven with the lives of other men in other countries as to make it impossible to be in this world and not of it.
       </para>
       <para>
        They are great comments, but it is unfortunate that the United States Administration is not adhering to them at the present time, because the EEP is costing us money and markets. While there has been debate that, by using EEP as a lever, the United States will ultimately be able to bring the Europeans to the table, that has not been the case and I do not think it necessarily will be.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now quote from a paper prepared by a Robert L. Paarlberg, an American, as follows:
       </para>
       <para>
        Some defenders have tried to argue that EEP's doubtful success in capturing foreign markets or in pressuring the EC budget should all be seen as secondary. Its real value, they say, is as a ``bargaining chip'' in the current Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations. Without an export subsidy program of its own to trade away, the United States will stand little chance in GATT of persuading the EC to give up its export restitutions. The analogy is sometimes made to an arms control negotiation, and the presumed need to ``deploy'' an EEP (like we deployed Pershing II missiles in Europe) in order to get a multilateral agreement to scrap all export subsidies (just like the deal we finally got from Gorbachev to scrap all Euro missiles).
       </para>
       <para>
        This argument has two problems. First, recall the failure of our EEP deployments, so far, to put any real budget or market-loss pressure on the EC. As bargaining chips go, the EEP isn't weighty enough to threaten the Community, or to be traded away against EC export subsidies, which dwarf the EEP in size by a margin of roughly 10 to 1. Unfortunately, though, the EEP has been just large enough to give the U.S. ``dirty hands'' in GATT, and to attract a barrage of criticism towards the United States from those in GATT that ought to be our natural allies against the Community-the Canadians and the Australians. The EEP has so far given U.S. negotiators in GATT an export subsidy program just large enough to blur differences between U.S. and EC policy, and just large enough to attract criticism from the Cairns Group, but not large enough to trade away for anything.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think those comments make sense. A woman cannot be a little bit pregnant; and that is basically what the EEP is.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other interesting thing regarding the EEP, in relation to farm family income in the United States, is that it has exceeded that of the average family in America for more than 25 years; and federal farm spending does not go to poor farmers anyway. The largest farms in America-those with gross receipts of more than $US500,000 a year-receive 60 per cent of all price support money. That point is often forgotten. When some of these southern United States politicians who really do need to see Dr Christiaan Barnard when it comes to principles stand up and talk about looking after the little farmer, they are really talking about the big conglomerates, not the little farmer at all. Subsidies have never been beneficial to little farmers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The EEP program is not helping little farmers either; it is helping the countries that buy the grain. It is ironic that the two countries that have benefited most have been the Soviet Union, which has demonstrated this week that it is hardly a knight in shining armour, and communist China.
       </para>
       <para>
        All in all, I believe that the United States needs to look closely at the EEP program and that, when we come to the GATT negotiations in the next few months, everybody will have to put their cards on the table. This is the one big chance for Australian agriculture. We stand tall because we have done the right thing and we have led the way in free trade. Our hands are clean, unlike those of the United States and the Europeans. I believe that for the farm sector these are the most important trade negotiations this country has seen since the 1930s. I believe that everyone on both sides of the House will wish the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Dr Blewett) all the very best when he goes to take on the Europeans. (Time expired)

        That the House expresses its deep regret at the death, on Thursday, 20 June 1991, of John Norman Nelson, member of the House of Representatives for the Northern Territory from 1949 to 1966, places on record its appreciation for his long and meritorious service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.

        John Nelson, more affectionately known as Jock, was born in 1908 at Mount Perry near Bundaberg. He moved to the Northern Territory with his parents at the age of five and was educated at Pine Creek and later at Darwin High School. Before joining Federal Parliament, Jock spent time as a jackeroo, was part of the Tennant Creek gold rush, and then worked as a boring contractor and agent in Alice Springs. He was in the AIF from 1942 to 1945, serving both in Australia and overseas.
       </para>
       <para>
        He began his political career as foundation member for Stuart in the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory. He served on the Council for two years from 1947. Jock was elected to this House in 1949 as member for the Northern Territory and was re-elected at five subsequent elections before his retirement in 1966.
       </para>
       <para>
        During his time in Parliament he was a member of the Select Committee on Voting Rights of Aborigines and the Select Committee on the Grievances of the Yirrkala Aborigines in the Arnhem Land Reserve. He also joined parliamentary delegations on visits to Papua New Guinea and Warsaw. In addition to his many parliamentary duties, he served as Secretary to the Parliamentary Labor Party for 10 years from 1956 to 1966. He fought hard throughout his time in this House for the successful development of resources in the Northern Territory and for the rights of Northern Territory people.
       </para>
       <para>
        Jock re-entered public life in 1971 as the first Mayor of Alice Springs and in 1973 was honoured with appointment as Administrator of the Northern Territory for a three-year term. It was a measure of the man that there was no question but that his choice for that position was a very popular one across the spectrum.
       </para>

        Others will give the House a more personal appreciation of the contribution that Mr Nelson made to the Federal Parliament as representative of the Northern Territory from 1949 to 1966. They were the years of fundamental development for the Northern Territory-opening up the land for agricultural use, building all-weather roads to get beef cattle to market, uncovering the Territory's huge mineral wealth and developing infrastructure services for Darwin and other communities in the Territory. In the Federal Parliament Jock Nelson was a strong fighter for northern development. Nothing irked him more than the fact that in his early years in this place he was not allowed to vote on issues outside the Northern Territory. Mr Nelson rightly took this as an insult to the people of the Northern Territory, who were being treated as second class citizens and eventually won the right to vote on all issues.
       </para>
       <para>
        In that sense, he was a chip off the old block. His father, Harold Nelson, led a minor mutiny in Darwin in the 1920s under the banner of `no taxation without representation'. Mr Nelson senior won that fight and became the Northern Territory's first representative in this Parliament, an honour his son repeated in 1949. Like the Hon. Bob King about whom we shall be speaking in a moment, Jock Nelson was one of that generation of men and women who served their country in war, then came back home to serve their country in peace as a member of parliament. All of us owe a great debt to that generation. They were the ones who laid the foundations for Australia's growth through the 1960s and the 1970s. There is a responsibility on all of us to ensure that the gains they made are not frittered away by the current generation of timid policy makers.

         —I am very pleased to be able to speak on this condolence motion, although, of course, it saddens us to be discussing one of our past colleagues. Jock Nelson passed away on 20 June. He was indeed a fighter, as both the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) have said. He was, beyond everything else, a true Territorian, an outstanding figure who stands like a colossus in the political history of the Northern Territory.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        He spent much of his working life working for and serving his community. Jock's efforts were central to the Australian Labor Party becoming the significant entity that it is today in the polity of the Northern Territory. For this reason, all Labor Party members in the Northern Territory owe much to Jock Nelson. Indeed, they owe him a great debt, but it is a debt which is shared by the whole of the Northern Territory community because of the contribution that he made to its public service.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the Leader of the Opposition has said, Jock came from a political family. He was a son of the first member for the Northern Territory, Harold Nelson. Harold Nelson was a union organiser in Darwin who held the position of Secretary of the Australian Workers Union and the Northern Territory Workers Union and was elected as member for the Northern Territory from 1922 to 1934.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Northern Territory's representation in this place can be said to stem directly from the activities of the Nelson family-in particular, Harold Nelson. In 1918, Harold Nelson led a march of 1,000 workers-a major revolt-to the residence of the then Administrator, Dr John Anderson Gilruth, with a demand that he leave town and with an avowal that there would be no taxation paid without representation. The Administrator left and there was representation. So Harold Nelson forged the beginnings of a great family tradition in struggling for the interests of the Northern Territory.
       </para>
       <para>
        Jock Nelson, like his father, was a person who had great dedication, courage and personal commitment. There is evidence of that and of the sorts of travails that he was prepared to put himself through. At the age of 19 he purchased 300 sheep at Quorn in South Australia and then, at the equivalent of $2 each, he railed the sheep to Oodnadatta. He purchased two camels and then, with the assistance of an Aboriginal person, and with their gear, walked the sheep to Waite River Station, a distance of 1,000 kilometres. This walk obviously took its toll on the sheep because, while Jock and the Aboriginal person prospered in later life, the sheep died, as a result of the journey, in a later drought.
       </para>
       <para>
        In any event, it showed the sorts of guts and determination that were required by Jock Nelson to serve as member for the Northern Territory. He worked as a jackeroo, a bore driller, a pastoralist and, as the Prime Minister has said, in Tennant Creek during the time of the gold rush. In 1934, Jock married Peg Bloomfield on her father's property at Loves Creek Station. Jock then moved to Tennant Creek and during World War II served with the Royal Australian Engineers.
       </para>
       <para>
        His first entry into politics was as a foundation member of the Northern Territory Legislative Council from 1947 to 1949, representing the seat of Stuart. Today, the seat of Stuart in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly is held by the parliamentary leader of the Northern Territory Labor Party, Brian Ede. In the 1949 general election Jock Nelson was elected to this House as the member for the Northern Territory and, as the Prime Minister has said, was re-elected on a number of occasions-in 1951; in 1955, when he was unopposed and re-elected; in 1958; and in 1963, when he was unopposed. Jock had an illustrious parliamentary career, including the membership of delegations and committees.
       </para>
       <para>
        Jock remained active following his retirement from the House of Representatives in 1966, being the first mayor of Alice Springs between 1971 and 1973, and then becoming Administrator of the Northern Territory in 1973-the first Territorian to hold that position. So he had been involved in every level of government and public administration in the Northern Territory during his working life.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the Prime Minister has said, it is a tribute to Jock Nelson and the way he felt about the Labor Party and the Government of this country that he resigned his position as Administrator to fight the 1975 general election: such was his shock at the dismissal of the Whitlam Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        A recognition of the achievements of Jock Nelson was made last week with the naming of new Commonwealth offices in Alice Springs as the Jock Nelson Centre. In fact, only a fortnight before Jock passed away, I had discussed with him the prospect of naming this building and whether or not he would be in favour of us naming that building in his honour. In a very humble way he said that he would be, as long as there was no-one else that it could be named after. He and his wife mentioned the name of another prominent person in central Australia who might be seen as more important; alas, that was not to be, and now that centre is named the Jock Nelson Centre. It gave me great pride to be present at the opening.
       </para>
       <para>
        In preparing this short speech, I looked at some of the Hansard records of Jock Nelson's contribution to this House and noted that, although over 40 years have passed since he became the member for the Northern Territory, many of the issues that he was concerned with in representing the people of the north have changed little.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the late 1940s and early 1950s there were fewer than 30,000 people in the Northern Territory, roughly half of whom were Aboriginal people; of course, they did not have the right to vote. At this time, issues that Jock brought to the attention of Parliament included, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, improvements to roads and water supplies, improved land-use planning and surveying of the Territory, defence issues, tax zonal arrangements and the education needs of isolated children.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the current member for the Northern Territory, it is with a sense of deja vu that I read of Jock's concerns with these issues some 40 years ago because many of the same issues are brought to my attention by my constituents on a daily basis. On the other hand, of course, many things have changed in the Northern Territory since 1949, not the least of which is the situation in relation to Aboriginal people.
       </para>
       <para>
        Jock was a strong campaigner for self-government in the Northern Territory and saw in his lifetime the transition from the formation of the inaugural Legislative Council in 1947 to the adoption of self-government in 1978. The Northern Territory truly has lost one of its most warmly remembered political figures.
       </para>
       <para>
        I was proud to be present at the funeral and represent the Government and to see people who travelled to Alice Springs, including Frank Crean, Reg Bishop and Clyde Cameron, all of whom had served in this Parliament with Jock Nelson. I extend my personal sympathies to Peg, to his sisters, Thelma Underdown, Stella Walker and Lyla Emanuel, to his children, Pat Barber and Louanne Rosewarne, and their husbands, Bob and Paul, and to their children, Trenton, Kirsty, Grant and Carol.

         —Jock Nelson's contribution to the development of the Northern Territory stands out in all that I have read about his service to the nation and to this Parliament. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) have detailed this, so I will not repeat it, other than to say that Jock was one of those people who served in all three levels of government, in the following order: the Northern Territory Government first, the Federal Government second and local government third.

        He joins a unique grouping of people, including John Sullivan, the former member for Riverina-Darling, who served in Federal Parliament, State Parliament and then local government. I think that people who provide service in all three levels of government are a special category of person and I acknowledge the contribution that they make in so doing.
       </para>
       <para>
        Prior to his work as a parliamentarian, it should be noted that he served this country in the 2nd AIF with the Royal Australian Engineers. He served both in Australia and overseas during World War II. As a former infantryman myself, I have a high regard for the engineers, or sappers, without whose support the fighting corps of infantry, armour and artillery-not to mention all those supporting services-could not effectively do their jobs.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Parliament sent engineers to Namibia two years ago because of their highly specialised skills. I salute Jock Nelson's service to this country in the Royal Australian Engineers as a sapper, as a corporal and as a sergeant. I also salute John Nelson's commitment to the productive sectors of the economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        As Leader of the National Party, I am attracted to that part of his speech in 1950 discussing Tennant Creek highlighting the problems of Tennant Creek when he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The population of Tennant Creek is about 800, and all drinking water has to be carted a distance of six miles. The water costs 11s. a 100 gallons, and until recently the price was double that amount. Honourable members can readily understand how such a state of affairs tends to retard the development of the town. Those are the conditions that prevail in an area where it is expected more than #500,000 worth of gold will be produced this year-
       </para>
       <para>
        That was in 1950. It was a battle that Jock Nelson fought with great determination to better the infrastructure of the Northern Territory.
       </para>
       <para>
        On two occasions Jock Nelson was elected unopposed to the House of Representatives, albeit as a member with restricted voting rights, as was the constitutional and legislative provision at that time. They were the elections in 1955 and 1963. He joins a unique club in having the honour of being elected unopposed to this House not once, but twice. I was interested to read that during his time as a member of this House he fought tirelessly, as others have mentioned, to ensure that the Northern Territory Federal representative was given full extended voting rights and put on an equal footing with other members of the House, along with Mr Fraser, then serving as the member for the ACT. Of course, that was subsequently granted.
       </para>
       <para>
        After his retirement from Federal politics he did not let go, he contributed to the community-above all else as the first mayor of Alice Springs in the early 1970s, and later as Administrator for the part of Australia that he loved so dearly, the Northern Territory. I extend sympathy to the Nelson family and I commend the service of Jock Nelson to the State, to the Northern Territory, to Federal Parliament, to local government and to the nation.

         —I want to add a few words as one who served in this Parliament with Jock Nelson. Jock was one of those real characters of the bush. One could not help admiring the things he had done, the places he had been and the attempts he had made to correct them. So much of it has been said today, but I cannot help recording on the biographical register of the Commonwealth Parliament the description which I think says it all. It comments that after being educated at Pine Creek and the Darwin High School he worked in Alice Springs in 1926 as a jackeroo. He was unsuccessful with sheep, then with cattle and in butchering. He was at the opening of the Tennant Creek gold rush in 1934 and remained there until 1936, when the field collapsed. He was then a boring contractor and an agent at Alice Springs. He was all those things, in addition to his war service and his tremendous contribution in the three levels of government and as Administrator to the Northern Territory.

I add my respects to his memory and extend my condolences to his wife, his children and the members of his family.

        That this House expresses its deep regret at the death, in June of this year, of the Hon. R. S. King OBE, the honourable member for Wimmera from 1958 to 1977 and Assistant Minister to the Minister for Primary Industry from 1971 to 1972, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.

        Robert King was born on 22 March 1920 at Warracknabeal in Victoria and educated at Carey Grammar School. He enlisted with the AIF in 1940 and served his country admirably with 2/24 Battalion in the Tobruk and El Alamein campaigns, achieving the rank of lieutenant. He later fought at Lae in New Guinea. He was severely wounded in 1943 and was discharged in 1945.
       </para>
       <para>
        He was first elected to this House as member for Wimmera in 1958. Bob served on several parliamentary committees, including the House Committee on Printing, which subsequently became the Publications Committee, the Joint Committee on Parliamentary and Government Publications and the Joint Committee on Prices.
       </para>
       <para>
        Bob was also a delegation member on visits to South East Asia, to Copenhagen-for the fifty-third conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union-and later to Paris for the fifty-ninth conference. In 1971 he was appointed Minister Assisting the Minister for Primary Industries and held this position until 1972. On his retirement from Federal politics in 1977, he had been the longest serving member for that area of Victoria since Federation.
       </para>
       <para>
        He joined Wimmera Legacy in 1956 and was President in 1980-81. In 1982 Bob's valuable contribution both to the Parliament and the greater community was recognised when he was awarded the Order of the British Empire by the Queen. On behalf of the Government, I extend our sincere sympathy to his wife and family in their bereavement.

         —It was not my privilege or pleasure to know Bob King, who left the service of this Parliament well before my relatively brief time in this place. Other members of this Parliament who were his contemporaries will undoubtedly speak with greater knowledge of and affection for Mr King. However, on reading his background I was struck by one thing-Bob King was one of a breed of members whose numbers are now dwindling in this place. He was a war hero who, after having served his country in time of conflict, entered the Parliament to help build the nation through times of peace.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Bob King's life was one of service-to his country in the Second World War, to the rural industries in his seat of Wimmera and to this Parliament. It is a concept of service to the community which, I fear, is diminishing in these times of family financial pressure, self-interest and personal ambition. Bob King's record shows that he enlisted in the Australian Army in 1940 and fought in the Middle East and New Guinea. In September 1945, as the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has noted, he was badly wounded while leading his men on a river crossing and, after recovering from his wounds, returned to his farm in the Wimmera.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1958 he entered the Federal Parliament, representing the Country Party, as it then was. He served the people of Wimmera for 19 years, winning eight elections over that time. No doubt he would have gone on, having won the confidence of the rural communities of the western Victorian district, but the redistribution of 1977 put paid to his parliamentary career. Bob King prudently decided that it was not the done thing to challenge his Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, for the seat of Wannon, which took in a large part of the old electorate of Wimmera, and he decided to retire gracefully.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am told that Bob King was a close friend of Malcolm Fraser and was a strong supporter of the coalition. During his years in the Parliament, Bob King was a stout champion of the rural industries-in particular, the wheat industry. He took an active and positive role in its affairs as a back bench advocate for the industry's interests.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is worth noting that in those days the international wheat trade was no less difficult than it is now, with the unfair trading practices of our competitors forcing efficient Australian wheat growers out of markets. Bob King always pushed hard for a square deal for Australian wheat growers. Wider afield, he was a missionary for a greater Australian trade with Asia. He even undertook his own private, one-man trade mission to China, Hong Kong, Malaysia and other parts of Asia. He predicted that Australia's beef exports would double if each person in China would eat only half a pound of beef in a year. That proved too big a task, but we would have to give him points for trying.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another point worth noting about Bob King's parliamentary career is that he was one of the first Assistant Ministers appointed when Prime Minister McMahon instituted a new system of appointing Assistant Ministers to help Ministers handle the routine workload of their portfolios.
       </para>
       <para>
        Bob King never forgot his comrades from the war and their widows and orphans. For many years he was active in the RSL and in Legacy and was involved in lobbying the Government from within for better services and benefits for veterans and their dependants. My colleagues join with me in expressing our condolences to Mr King's widow and three daughters and our appreciation of a lifetime of service to Australia.

        Bob King's election as the member for Wimmera was a case of one coalition partner responding to local pressure for change. Wimmera and Mallee, of course, are very difficult for the Australian Labor Party to win. Bob King and, more recently, Bill McGrath in the State Parliament turned Wimmera from a Liberal to a National Party electorate. He worked very hard in a natural coalition seat, as does the present member, the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher).

         —Bob King was a dedicated and determined member for Wimmera in western Victoria over the nigh on two decades that he served in the House of Representatives. He was appointed to the position of Assistant Minister to the Minister for Primary Industry in 1971, and he will be remembered by the more senior members in the House-particularly my colleague the honourable member for New England, the Rt Hon. Ian Sinclair. I personally did not know Bob King well. However, as a veteran, I was particularly touched by his selfless service to the nation during the Second World War.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I would like to place on record his record with the 2/24 Battalion in both the Middle East and New Guinea. Bob King served as an officer in the Australian Army during some of the most significant battles of the Second World War, including Tobruk and El Alamein, and Lae in New Guinea, where he was severely wounded by Japanese machine-gun fire whilst crossing the Busu River.
       </para>
       <para>
        After the war, Bob King farmed near Warracknabeal before entering Parliament in 1958. A reading of his maiden speech indicates his heartfelt concern for those vital issues which the Country Party and the National Party have always pursued, namely, wheat, wool, the provision of social infrastructure for those in rural and regional areas, and roads infrastructure.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the member for Wimmera, Bob King spent much of his time on the wheat issue. That was reflected in his ultimate appointment as Assistant Minister to the Minister for Primary Industry, and in his personal efforts to build bridges between Australia and Asia with his mission and visits to that part of the world.
       </para>
       <para>
        Bill McGrath, my friend and colleague in the State Parliament, tells me that Bob King remained active beyond his retirement directly from Federal politics, and was Bill McGrath's campaign director for the 1979, 1982, 1985 and 1988 State elections. Bob King's electorate was redistributed in 1977 between the seats of Mallee and Wannon.
       </para>
       <para>
        Being a dedicated and loyal gentleman, Bob King resolved that he would not stand against his National Party colleague and my good friend Peter Fisher, the honourable member for Mallee. He also resolved that he was not going to stand against the then Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, in the electorate of Wannon. History might have been very much different had he done so in that election.
       </para>
       <para>
        After Bob King left all of his direct political involvements, he maintained a particular interest in veterans and repatriation issues. He often approached me, as shadow Minister for Veterans' Affairs, with constructive ideas and thoughts with regard to policy development and changes to the totally and permanently incapacitated pensioner arrangements, and other changes which occurred from Budget to Budget.
       </para>
       <para>
        Bob King was always thinking of other people in the contribution he made on those issues, while himself suffering deteriorating health. It was no trouble for Bob King to go to considerable effort to put forward and push along these views on repatriation policy, notwithstanding the increasing difficulties he himself had. I join with my colleagues in extending sympathy to the King family, and in saluting the service of Bob King to the electors of Wimmera, as it was, to the State of Victoria and to our nation.

        Bob entered politics as the representative for Wimmera in Victoria in 1958 by defeating the sitting Liberal Party member, Mr W. Lawrence. He subsequently won seven elections, only to have his seat abolished by redistribution in 1977. Bob King did not have an easy entry into Parliament. All his contests were closely fought and his margin was never great. As he said in his last speech to the Parliament, his first vote was his worst and his last vote was his best, which is indicative of the esteem in which he was held by his constituents.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the Parliament has been told, he was Assistant Minister for Primary Industry in 1971-72 and, as such, a member of the Executive Council. Bob King's efforts on behalf of his rural constituents in the Parliament have already been mentioned, but I must emphasise his commitment to issues affecting rural people and to the importance of the agricultural sector of world trade. He was part of, and helped to initiate, the push to engender trade with China, particularly in wheat and meat.
       </para>
       <para>
        Bob King was always a courageous man. His crossing of the floor, together with Sir Winton Turnbull, the then member for Mallee, to vote with the Opposition on an amendment to the Wheat Stabilisation Bill was an example of his determination to do the best he could for his constituents. In retrospect, his decision then has been proved to be correct, as the introduction of wheat quotas severely affected the opportunities of a generation of young farmers. He was a farmer himself and successfully farmed a sheep and cereal property at Warracknabeal. Together with his father and brother he operated one of Australia's finest Border Leicester sheep studs, `Crymelon'.
       </para>
       <para>
        In his last speech, when announcing his retirement from politics, it is significant that instead of sentimental rhetoric Bob raised the matter of an unresolved immigration case dealing with a Chinese national, calling on the responsible Minister to immediately determine the issue.
       </para>
       <para>
        Bob King enlisted from Warracknabeal into the 2nd AIF in June 1940, and after initial training joined the 2/24 Infantry Battalion. He saw active service for seven months during the Siege of Tobruk; he was part of the bitter fighting at El Alamein, in Syria and in Palestine. On his return to Australia in 1943 he was sent immediately to New Guinea, where he was severely wounded during the attack on Lae and spent almost 12 months in hospital. He served his country for four and a half years, most of which time was spent on foreign soil.
       </para>
       <para>
        Bob became an active member of the Warracknabeal sub-branch of the RSL in 1945 and became President in 1958. He held many official positions, including with the RSL welfare patriotic fund, as pensions and welfare officer, chairman of the RSL bowls committee, and organiser of the annual Diggers' bowls and Edinburgh Shield tournaments. He was past chairman and delegate to State conferences for many years and served on the council from 1957 to 1962. He was also a member of the land settlement committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the 46 years Bob was a member of the RSL he spent countless hours working behind the scenes looking after the needs of others, always in an honorary capacity. `Digger' Bob King always showed that RSL spirit of helping his fellow man in his doggedness to see a matter through to its conclusion, his tenacity to push a matter in which he believed and, above all, his endurance and constancy in whatever task or project he undertook. Bob was a very proud member of the Rats of Tobruk Association.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a member of this Parliament, Bob was relentless in pursuing amendments to legislation affecting veterans and in correcting anomalies for the benefit of all Australian ex-service men and women. His contribution to this country through his political service was outstanding and well documented by previous speakers; but he rendered exceptional service in many other areas, particularly in his work with Legacy. He was President of Wimmera Legacy in 1980-81 and was a former chairman of the State Legacy pensions committee. Bob King was always concerned about his Legacy widows and their children in the Wimmera and how he could help them.
       </para>
       <para>
        This commitment was widely acknowledged and respected at his funeral at Warracknabeal on 2 July, where 150 of his RSL colleagues and friends formed a guard of honour. It is a measure of the man that in my years as a member of parliament I have never seen such a large contingent of RSL members at a private funeral. In 1982 Bob was awarded an OBE for his services to ex-service personnel and for parliamentary service. He was made a life member of the Warracknabeal sub-branch in 1990.
       </para>
       <para>
        Bob's retirement from Federal Parliament did not dilute his interest in political life and, in particular, the National Party. His active advice and involvement in subsequent State and Federal campaigns have been largely responsible for the maintenance and growth of my Party's parliamentary and rank and file membership in western Victoria.

I express my condolences to his wife Elsie and to his daughters, Cheryl, Robyn and Merrin, and their husbands and families. With them, we praise a life well lived in the service of his people and of the country he loved.

        I remember speaking with Cyril Sudholz-one must remember that the Wimmera and Mallee areas have political lives of their own-who stood for the Labor Party on many occasions, mainly hoping to save his deposit because there was no chance of winning a seat in that area. When Bob was finally elected he approached Cyril, who was to be our Labor Party candidate, and suggested that it was time Lawrence went, he was not doing anything for the area, et cetera; and that, if Cyril gave Bob preferences, they could fix that between them. Cyril said, `If you swap preferences with me and I swap them with you, one of us will win'. Bob said, `I don't know about that'; but he did win the seat and he stayed in it for 20 years.

        Not long after I came to the Parliament one of the interesting debates was on wheat quotas. Some honourable members, although not many, will remember that some people in Western Australia decided to cash in on a scheme that was very popular if you went in quickly and grew enough wheat. We had a debate on it here at 4.30 in the morning, and I had the privilege of sitting in the chair as Temporary Chairman for some of that debate. Other than Ministers, every Country Party member-and they were Country Party members-stood up and opposed the wheat quotas Bill. Bob not only spoke against it, he actually voted against it; and he was one of only two who did. It did not worry him that the odium of it may cost him promotion at a later stage. He stuck to the people he represented: the Wimmera wheat farmers.

       <para>
        One story I want to tell the House happened when he was Assistant Minister; it would be one of the most ludicrous I have heard in my life. In this place we all know about accountability of public funds. At that time Ministers got stamps and members did not, so in his office in Horsham he had to keep a book for the stamps he used as an Assistant Minister separate from those he used for his electorate. Once a month a bloke came up from Melbourne-a two-day trip of 220 miles-to check his stamp book and see that the pound or two pounds he had spent on stamps had been spent on the right mail. I have never heard of anything so ludicrous in all my life, but it went on.

       <para>
        Bob was one of those people who served his country and the Services well. In later life he served in this Parliament. I think I can honestly say-unless somebody has cleaned up my desk since I left yesterday-that Bob's most recent visiting card is still sitting on the blotter on my desk in my electorate office. He called in a while back but I was not in at the time. Because he did not think my secretary would know him he left me a card to remember him by. He regularly dropped in on people and talked with them, usually about ex-service and veterans' matters. I think he will be missed. I would also like to pass on my condolences to his family and to all of those others who knew him.

         —Like honourable members before me, I would like to say a few words in memory of Bob King. He was a great soldier, a very good parliamentarian and an outstanding citizen. As a soldier, he marks that generation which served at Tobruk, in the islands of the Pacific, and then Papua New Guinea. He came back, his price being the wounds he suffered in that attack on Lae. He subsequently entered Parliament and, as has been said, served nearly 20 years as the member for Wimmera, a seat that has now disappeared.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        My association with him came more in that period when he was serving as a member. He was assistant to me as Minister for Primary Industry in the McMahon Government, at a time when you, Mr Deputy Speaker, were also a Minister assisting. It was a strange role and, as the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) has just said, it really imposed extraordinary disciplines on members.
       </para>
       <para>
        The thing I remember most about Bob is how effectively he worked on behalf of the wheat growers. We have heard about the quota debate. I can tell honourable members that he was just as effective in trying to ensure that there was a continuation of a wheat stabilisation scheme that he believed would offset some of the predatory practices about which we still hear so much. Indeed, his whole political career was concentrated around three main issues: the rural sector; transport and the roads he saw as being absolutely essential to his people; and communications. He spent a great deal of time looking at the operation of the then Postmaster-General's Department-access to telephones, postal deliveries, declining frequency of rural mail services, and those factors that so much affected the quality of life of people in his electorate.
       </para>
       <para>
        As an Assistant Minister, he was extraordinarily helpful to me. I pay particular tribute to the work he did at a time of considerable difficulty in the rural sector. I can remember a time when if we went to meetings at which there were fewer than a thousand people we thought something had gone wrong. Times were very hard indeed. The introduction of wheat quotas reflected it; the collapse in the wool industry was part of it. I attended a meeting of wine grape growers in the Murray River area. It was an extraordinarily difficult time. While all of us know today that things are very difficult, in those days markets were hard, and Bob King was one of those who played a notable part at that time.
       </para>
       <para>
        As has been said, Bob did not make a contribution only at war and in the Parliament. I think there are few who, after they have left the Parliament, did as much as Jock Nelson-whom we heard of a moment ago-and Bob King-in Legacy, the RSL and the community. Bob continued to work hard and effectively on behalf of the community.
       </para>
       <para>
        He was a great Australian, and on behalf of my wife and myself I extend our sympathy to his wife, Elsie, his three daughters, their husbands and families. I was fortunate to have been able to attend his funeral service. It was indeed a moving one. I thought the tribute by so many of his returned service colleagues said a great deal about the mark he made on them and the community. His memory will live while there are so many who see in the Wimmera and Mallee a life that is possible through the land he worked so hard to make easier for them.

         —I wish to support the condolence motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) for the Hon. Bob King, the last member for Wimmera, and a man who was a personal friend and colleague. I think it is a pity that Wimmera, one of the great regional wheat growing areas of Australia, is no longer recognised in this Parliament by the name of a seat-although I am not suggesting that Mallee should disappear to be replaced by Wimmera.

       <para>
        Bob was one of the great bulwarks of the Country Party, and then the National Party, both in Victoria and federally. He was a genuine rural Australian. He had a concern for people who lived in the country and, as the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) has mentioned, particularly transport and communications. As a farmer, he was concerned for the rural industries that still create wealth and employment opportunities for people right throughout rural and regional Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        He served not only rural Australia but Australia generally in war and in peace. He was a member of the 2nd AIF, and after 4 1/2 years of active service was discharged after being severely wounded. After the war he had an active and continuing role in the RSL and Legacy. He was a Federal member from 1958 to 1977, until the abolition of his seat. In the eight elections he contested, he lived dangerously. In conservative areas, with three-cornered contests, they were tough battles.
       </para>
       <para>
        He was recognised for the work he did by gradually strengthening his position. It is a lesson for conservative politicians that in those difficult times of three-cornered contests he was always a strong supporter of the coalition. His work for primary industries was recognised by his being made Assistant Minister for Primary Industry in the last 15 months of the McMahon-Anthony Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        After his parliamentary retirement he continued to work for the National Party throughout Victoria and maintained his other community involvements. I extend my and Heather's sympathy to Elsie and to his daughters and their families.

        This Bill makes amendments to the Australian Wool Corporation Act 1991, the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Act 1991, aspects of the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 concerning the Wool Research and Development Corporation and the Australian Horticultural Corporation Amendment Act 1991 to correct omissions and drafting errors. All of these Acts were passed in the last session of Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        With regard to the amendments to the wool legislation, honourable members will recall that a package of urgent legislation putting in place new arrangements for the wool industry to apply from 1 July 1991 was passed in the last hours of the autumn sittings.
       </para>
       <para>
        On further examination of the legislation and consultations with the Attorney-General's Department, it has become apparent that some minor additional transitional provisions are needed. Attorney-General's has advised that the wording of the existing legislation is such that it is not possible to appropriate and transfer to the wool statutory authorities wool tax imposed on wool sold prior to 1 July 1991 but received by the Commonwealth after that date. Clearly, the situation needs to be rectified and the provisions of this Bill do that. The provisions of the existing legislation regarding wool tax on wool sold after 1 July 1991 are adequate and do not need amending.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is recognised that, as a result of the defect in the legislation, the wool statutory authorities have not had, since early July, access to the flow of wool tax funds which they should have had. They would therefore have incurred additional expense either through interest forgone or through additional interest costs on borrowed funds. The Government considers that the statutory authorities, and through them the woolgrowers, should not have to bear the additional expense caused by the drafting omission. Therefore the Government will pay interest for the period of the delay in the wool tax payments. The Bill provides that the Minister will determine the interest rate to apply and I envisage that the rate will be based on that which the Commonwealth earns on investment of its surplus funds.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also proposes that interest will be payable by the Commonwealth on the delay in payment to the wool statutory authorities of wool tax money received by the Commonwealth immediately before 30 June 1991 but not paid out until after that date, while the legal questions were being resolved. The Commonwealth passed to the Realisation Commission wool tax in this category in late July and early August and relevant portions have, under the regulations, since been passed on to the Wool Corporation and the Wool Research and Development Corporation.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is also an amendment to carry over into the new legislation for wool research and development provisions to reflect the existing Commonwealth policy of matching research and development funds raised by primary industries up to a ceiling of 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production or the amount of levy collected.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Deputy Speaker, the Bill provides additional transitional arrangements in relation to the establishment of the Australian Dried Fruits Board. The board commenced operations on 1 July 1991 as a product board within the Australian Horticultural Corporation. It was established under provisions contained in the Australian Horticultural Corporation Amendment Act 1991 as part of the reform of Government assistance arrangements for the dried vine fruits industry. Other measures covered changes to dried vine fruits statutory equalisation and sultana underwriting.
       </para>
       <para>
        The board took on the dried vine fruit export marketing and promotion functions of the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation. It is funded by an export charge imposed on exports of dried fruit.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Dried Fruits Export Charges Act 1924, which was repealed on 1 July 1991, provided the funds for the former Dried Fruits Corporation. However, a problem has arisen in making payments to the new board of funds raised under that Act but collected by the Commonwealth after the date of repeal. The Bill will provide for amounts equal to those collected by the Commonwealth to be appropriated to the board from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Provision is also to be made for interest accruing on these amounts outstanding to be payable to the board.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Deputy Speaker, the Government has introduced this Bill at the first opportunity to rectify omissions in complex legislation passed at the end of the last sittings. I appreciate the cooperation given by the Opposition in according this Bill speedy passage to enable the funds to flow to the organisations concerned. I thank the shadow Minister for his assistance.

         —The Bill before the House is the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 1991, an omnibus Bill that seeks to amend some 12 Acts within the portfolio of the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy).
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The coalition will not oppose the passage of this Bill, although it has some concern about one aspect of it. I foreshadow that during the committee stage I may move an amendment that seeks to delete the provisions found in the schedule of the Bill relating to the Law Officers Act 1964. However, I would naturally like to give the Attorney-General an opportunity to explain in some detail the nature of the provisions and, subject to any explanation that may be forthcoming from the Attorney, I may not move the amendment circulated in my name. However, as things stand at the moment, I am inclined to move the amendment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Furthermore, when the Bill reaches the other place my colleagues there will consider whether the proposed amendments to the Law Officers Act and the policy issues involved should be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Of course, that is a decision for the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second last item of the schedule amends section 16 of the Law Officers Act 1964 by repealing existing subsection (4) and substituting it with new subsections (4) and (4a). During his second reading speech the Attorney-General said that the amendments are designed:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . to ensure that a pension will be payable to a Solicitor-General who has served in that office for at least seven years. The Act currently provides that a pension is only payable to a Solicitor-General who has served at least seven years and who has not been re-appointed at the end of his or her term of office.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is quite true that subsection 16(4) of the Act provides that a pension is only payable to a Solicitor-General who has served for seven years, who has not been reappointed and who is not entitled to a pension under subsection (1). However, it must be borne in mind that subsection 16(4) as presently drafted was only introduced by section 43 of the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Act, being Act No. 120 of 1988. In 1988, a deliberate decision was taken that this particular pension entitlement should be available only where a Solicitor-General is not reappointed. The explanatory memorandum to the 1988 legislation said that the new provisions:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . provide for a pension to be payable to a person who has served as Solicitor-General for at least seven years, is not re-appointed and is not eligible for a judicial pension.
       </para>
       <para>
        I pause here to say that none of my remarks are intended to reflect on the current Solicitor-General, merely the strange changes that have emanated from the Government. At the time that legislation to which I just referred by quoting the explanatory memorandum was debated in November 1988, my predecessor as shadow Attorney-General, the then member for Menzies, the Hon. Neil Brown, QC, asked the then Attorney-General, the Hon. Lionel Bowen, to explain in some detail what the provisions were about. The then member for Menzies noted that the relevant provisions confer:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . a deferred pension to a disabled or infirm Solicitor-General who has served seven years but less than 10 years and who is, therefore, not entitled to a judicial pension. I will resist the temptation to say that this might be drawn with someone in mind,but it does seem to be a curious provision . . . one that I think, with respect, calls for a little further explanation . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        The then Attorney-General, in response to the query of the then member for Menzies, said:
       </para>
       <para>
        It may well be that our Solicitor-General will be reappointed, but the question arose whether he should be given some pro rata consideration on the same lines as that given to judges.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, if the Solicitor-General were not reappointed, he would be entitled to a pension under the new section 16(4); if the Solicitor-General were reappointed, the entitlements provided for under section 16a would come into play, and by subsection (1) the provisions of the Judges' Pension Act 1968 would apply to persons who have served as a Solicitor-General:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . as though the Solicitor-General were or had been a Judge and as though his service (whether in continuous periods or not) as Solicitor-General were service as a Judge.
       </para>
       <para>
        This picks up section 6 of the Judges' Pensions Act, which provides for a judicial pension to be payable upon retirement at the age of 60 years, where the person in question has held office for 10 years or more. If a Solicitor-General serves as a Solicitor-General for 10 years and retires at the age of 60, he or she is entitled to a judicial pension under that Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        Furthermore, under subsection 16(2), if a person who has been Solicitor-General is appointed as a judge, the period of service as a Solicitor-General is to be added to and be deemed to be part of his or her period of service as a judge for the purposes of the Judges' Pensions Act 1968. In addition, section 16a provides that a Solicitor-General who retires after a period of service of 10 years or more is entitled to a lump sum payment equal to his or her salary as Solicitor-General for a period of 52 weeks. Entitlement to that lump sum payment is in addition to the other entitlements under section 16.
       </para>
       <para>
        It would seem that in 1988 it was deliberately determined that the pension entitlement provided for under section 16(4) would be available only if a Solicitor-General, after serving seven years, were not-I repeat, not-reappointed. I fail to see why in present circumstances that intention should be altered in the manner contemplated by the amendments under present consideration. It falls upon the Attorney-General to explain whether something went wrong in 1988 or whether the circumstances have since changed and what those circumstances are.

        It is the Parliament's duty to question the appropriateness of allowances of this type, especially in times of wage restraint and harsh economic circumstances. Senior law officers, on taking up employment with the Commonwealth, do suffer some financial disadvantage in leaving private practice. However, in return they are rewarded with security in the form of fixed term appointments and, due to the nature of the work involved, are well placed to pursue fruitful careers should they return to private practice.

        The Government has put before the Remuneration Tribunal a submission asking that the Solicitor-General and the Director of Public Prosecutions be awarded substantial allowances in addition to the present salaries and allowances that those officers are entitled to. In July of this year, the Attorney-General went public with a virtual demand to his Cabinet colleagues that the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Solicitor-General be paid in line with the salaries the Government has approved for heads of government business enterprises and the head of the Reserve Bank of Australia; that is, salaries of around $230,000 a year. In financial terms, this would place the remuneration of the Solicitor-General and the Director of Public Prosecutions above that of the Chief Justice of the High Court, who receives a base salary of $180,733 per annum.
       </para>
       <para>
        In my view, this is inappropriate, bearing in mind that the Chief Justice, representing the apex of our system of government, was traditionally the highest paid officer of government. Regrettably, however, it has been the pressure of the ACTU that led to the Government's rejecting recommendations by the Remuneration Tribunal that the remuneration payable to federal judges be increased. This, I suppose, is just another example of how captive the Government is to the ACTU. The Government fails again to appreciate the implications of the separation of judicial and executive power and, of course, the independence of the Commonwealth judicature, upon which the Constitution is structured.
       </para>
       <para>
        The relative lowering of judicial salaries puts in jeopardy the independence of our judiciary and it is wrong, simply wrong, that senior law officers be paid more than the Chief Justice of the High Court. It is simply inappropriate to draw comparisons between the work of judges and that of members of the Executive, and it is doubly wrong to link their respective levels of remuneration. Our Constitution requires no linkage between the Executive and the judiciary. Once again, the Attorney-General has fallen for this mistake.

       <para>
        The Attorney-General is a man for whom I have the most enormous respect-I have said it time and again in here-and he is, in my more than a quarter of a century of work in this Parliament, the Minister most responsive to suggestions by the Opposition. But I just do not comprehend why he is, in effect, attacking the judges and inciting them to scathing attacks in return on the Government. It is no wonder that the judges are scathing in their criticism of this Government's absolute disdain for their status.
       </para>
       <para>
        The recent actions of the Government in this area have been bitterly attacked by the legal profession and by the judiciary as representing just one more step in a continuing process on the part of the Government to downgrade the relative remuneration and status of the judiciary. The level of disquiet amongst members of the judiciary has culminated in the Chief Justice of the High Court, Sir Anthony Mason, writing to the Chairman of the Remuneration Tribunal to deliver a scathing attack on the Government's disrespect for judicial independence. In that letter, Sir Anthony wrote that the proposals to increase the remuneration payable to senior law officers-those whom I have mentioned earlier, namely, the Solicitor-General and the Director of Public Prosecutions:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . indicate a want of understanding of the Constitutional position of the judiciary (in particular, the High Court) and the relationship which that position requires to be preserved between the judiciary and the Executive Government. More than that, when viewed in the light of the history of salary determination in recent years, they indicate an apparent want of understanding on the part of the Government of the nature and significance of the role of the judiciary. That want of understanding has led to an erosion in the remuneration and status of the judiciary.

       <para>
        On 17 April this year, I came into this place and gave the Attorney-General an opportunity to respond to these criticisms. I raised them, and the Attorney was, to put it mildly, somewhat dismissive of the views of the Chief Justice of the High Court and a plethora of other judges whom I quoted.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Attorney, as I will go on to remind him, sought to give me a little lecture on the background to the independence of the judiciary, its definition and his depth of comprehension of this issue. As I do with matters in which we are desperately interested on a Saturday, I listened with great interest to what he had to say and I reflected on it. I felt impelled to reject it out of hand, but as it came from him I gave it consideration and I took it away. He will recall that he went to the trouble of explaining the rationale behind the Government's proposals. According to the Attorney, senior law officers, unlike judges, do not have security of tenure. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        That has to be taken into account in salaries. It has to be taken into account in two ways: firstly, they do not have the tenure that Judges do and should have but, secondly, it also of course has an enormous effect on pension rights in relation to the Solicitor-General and the DPP.
       </para>
       <para>
        With respect to the issue of security of tenure, it must be remembered that these law officers, in contrast to their counterparts in private practice, have security in the form of fixed term appointments. On the question of pension rights, the comments of the Attorney in the case of the Solicitor-General seem at odds with the provisions of sections 16 and 16a of the Law Officers Act to which I have referred. Frankly speaking, whilst respecting the current Solicitor-General, without an explanation from the Attorney-General, I can only conclude that he is unjustifiably rewarding the current and future Solicitors-General. On change of government, that is something that I will rectify. It is just patently wrong that people can be so well rewarded in this way. Take into account the factors that I have raised. We have a situation in which a man or woman occupying this position will be entitled to a pension after only seven years service, whether he or she is reappointed or not, and then he or she can go onto the bench and the term that he or she spends there is taken into consideration for a judge's pension. Someone is doing very well out of this down the line, and I would like to know why. The net effect of pushing for the salary increases that are going on again in relation to the Solicitor-General-and it is better than I do on a Saturday on the Attorney's tips, I can tell you-is that he is going to be paid more than the Chief Justice of the High Court. This would have been drummed out of any tribunal in previous days, and I cannot even get an explanation in here as to just why this situation occurs.
       </para>
       <para>
        I was at university with the Attorney and I was at university with the Solicitor-General. Nothing was cooked up in those days. I have respect for both of them; I have known them for a long period. I just want to know why this is happening, and perhaps the Attorney can fill me in before this debate is over. If, as he so frequently does, he makes a plausible explanation, I will not proceed with the amendment. But I have to foreshadow that my colleagues in the other place might have a hard look at it. There is a bit of money floating around here.
       </para>
       <para>
        During the debate that took place on 17 April, the Attorney also recommended to me-he was in a very good mood that day and he was wishing to spread the depth of his knowledge-that I read an article published in volume 13 of the Melbourne University Law Review Journal, which he and his constituents read quite avidly.
       </para>
       <para>
        In volume 13, he suggested I read an article commencing at page 334 entitled `Judicial Independence-A Fragile Bastion'. As ever, I followed his advice and read the article. I became intrigued while reading it, because the Attorney-General had told me that it was written by-and I quote from Hansard-`a former Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia'. I found that a little hard to understand because it was written by Sir Ninian Stephen and, so far as I am aware, he spent his time at the High Court as a puisne judge, not as the Chief Justice. But even Attorneys can make mistakes.
       </para>
       <para>
        Then I reflected on what Sir Ninian wrote. Sir Ninian, after all, has not been entirely complimentary of the Government when it comes to the question of judicial independence. I refer the Attorney to a speech given by Sir Ninian to the Australian Institute of Judicial Administration in July 1989, when he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The evil of this erosion of judicial salaries will continue as a threat to judicial independence so long as sporadic and partial correction of the process of erosion is left to depend upon the very arms of Government of which the judiciary should be independent-it being dependent upon the Executive for effective initiation and upon the legislature for implementation . . . in the long term, by affecting the whole quality of the judiciary and their repute, the matter of remuneration bears quite directly on judicial independence.
       </para>
       <para>
        It will be recalled that the Attorney had said to me: `This question of remuneration and judicial independence is rubbish; you cannot link them. Read Sir Ninian Stephen'. I just remind the Attorney of what Sir Ninian Stephen said, particularly in that speech to the Institute of Judicial Administration.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Attorney thought it might be worth my while to read the article for it contained, he said, a useful definition of the term `judicial independence'. In citing that definition the Attorney overlooked the significance of the constitutional means by which judicial independence is to be ensured. They are twofold: first, security of tenure for judges, which of course is fundamental; and, secondly, that judicial remuneration not be diminished during the holding of office. They are, as indeed Mr Justice Brennan has described them, `the twin pillars of independence'.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the foundations of judicial independence are eroded or tampered with, the very independence of the judiciary will be put in jeopardy. According to the Attorney-General, any attempt to link remuneration with the question of judicial independence would be `absurd', and, to quote the Attorney, `That is not what judicial independence is about'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Not only did I think differently from the Attorney; others thought differently, others who were responsible for the drafting of the Constitution-our constitutional founders. I am not in bad company here: our constitutional fathers thought differently from the Attorney, for that very link appears in section 72 of the Constitution. Clearly, the Government does not understand the significance of the constitutional separation of powers and how that separation is to be maintained and respected.
       </para>
       <para>
        What I dispute most is not so much the particular levels or types of remuneration but rather the chaotic and disorderly manner in which they are arrived at. The process for determining the appropriate levels of remuneration that should be paid to judges and senior law officers is now in complete disarray, and it would be too generous to say that the decisions in this area are taken on an ad hoc basis. There is simply no rhyme-no reason-for the Government's thinking on the matter, unless it is a deliberate attack on the judges' status.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is much merit to the suggestion that there needs to be an independent tribunal, free from government and trade union pressures, to determine the appropriate levels of judicial remuneration, subject of course to Parliament's constitutional responsibilities. Under our Constitution, the Executive has no say in the fixing of salaries for Federal judges; it is a matter for Parliament to determine.
       </para>
       <para>
        During the debate I referred to earlier that took place on 17 April I also raised the imposition of provisional taxation on judicial salaries and the dramatic effect this was having on some Federal judges. My good friend the shadow Minister for tourism and aviation, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), will be staggered to know that the dramatic effect of this levying of provisional tax on judicial salaries is that some Federal judges are going to be left with an after-tax income for 1990-91 of approximately $12,500. I place before the House the documentary support to indicate that some judges would be left with only $12,500 for the whole financial year.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are two issues involved here: first, in an administrative sense the Government's actions are to be deplored, given that the judiciary was not consulted about the changes; and, furthermore, when it became apparent that many judges would not be able to meet those demands, the Government suggested that individual judges apply to the Taxation Office for an extension of time in which to make the payments. As the Chief Justice of the Family Court has said, this placed judges `in the position of supplicants to the Executive'. He was right.

        The second issue relates to the constitutional validity of the new measures. In response, the Attorney tabled what he described as advice from the Solicitor-General `in respect of PAYE and provisional tax'. However, the Solicitor-General's opinion relates only to the PAYE provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act and makes no mention of provisional tax. Perhaps the Government has obtained further advice that does deal with provisional tax. If that were the case, I would hope the Attorney could table any such advice.
       </para>
       <para>
        The opinion of the Solicitor-General dealing with the applicability of the PAYE provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act to judicial salaries raises some very interesting questions. According to the Solicitor-General, if judges are to be brought under the PAYE provisions, it would be desirable to do two things. First, the definition of `employee' in section 221a (1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act should be amended to make it clear that judges fall within that definition. Secondly, the remuneration of judges should be increased by an amount equal to the value of lost interest arising from the introduction of PAYE deductions. I ask the Attorney to advise the House whether the Government has acted on the suggestions made by the Solicitor-General.

       <para>
        In conclusion, whilst not opposing this Bill, the Opposition is concerned with that element relating to the Law Officers Act to which I have devoted a considerable amount of time tonight. Subject to the Attorney-General's response, I may move an amendment relating to that matter, that is, the unjustified easing of the pension requirements for the holder of the office of Solicitor-General.

         —The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill amends several Acts within the portfolio of the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy). In view of the comments of the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), I will confine myself to seeking to explain the proposed amendments to the Law Officers Act 1964, as it appears that the Opposition is not opposing the other amendments in this Bill. I think the Attorney-General will probably cover this, but in terms of the integrity of the High Court and its complaints about salaries it is important at the outset to point out that High Court judges are not doing too badly when we look at their pension scheme-and I understand that they do not make a contribution towards that. When we look at their entitlements when they leave office, they are well and truly compensated.

         —I will come to the Solicitor-General. In short, I think a concession needs to be made at the outset that the amendments that were put through in 1988 did not achieve what they were supposed to achieve. That is why this amendment has been put forward in relation to the Law Officers Act. It is proposed that the Law Officers Act will be amended to ensure that a Solicitor-General who has served at least seven years in that office will receive a pension unless he or she is removed from office for misbehaviour. The amendment should put beyond doubt that a pro rata pension will be payable if a Solicitor-General is removed from office for disability or following bankruptcy, which is the situation in relation to other public officers. I will come to that.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Law Officers Act is to be amended because subsection 16 (4) is to be omitted and replaced by two new subsections. Proposed new subsection 16 (4) will provide that a prorated pension will be payable to a Solicitor-General who has served in the office of Solicitor-General for an aggregate period of seven years and who ceases to hold office, after the commencement of the provision, otherwise than if the Solicitor-General is removed from office for misbehaviour. The amount of the pro-rated pension is calculated by reference to subsections 16 (5) to 16 (9) of the Law Officers Act. A pension will not be payable under this section if the Solicitor-General is entitled to a pension under the provisions of the Judges' Pensions Act 1968 because of subsection 16 (1) of the Law Officers Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        The proposed subsection 16 (4a) will provide that a person who is in receipt of a pro-rated pension, because of the operation of subsection 16 (8), who is appointed as Solicitor-General shall cease to receive that pension. This provision will avoid the payment of two pensions to a Solicitor-General who serves a second, discontiguous term of office after having attained the age of 60.
       </para>
       <para>
        By way of background, it is important to point out to the honourable member for Kooyong that from 1964 to 1968 the Solicitor-General has been entitled to a pension under the Judges' Pensions Act 1948-1961 if he or she retired after the age of 60 and after at least 10 years service. The 1948 Act provided a maximum pension of 40 per cent of salary. The pension increased from the minimum payable for a judge with 10 years service to the maximum. A lump sum of twice annual salary was payable to a Solicitor-General who had seven years service as Solicitor-General and who was not entitled to a judge's pension.
       </para>
       <para>
        But from 1968 to 1988 Solicitors-General were made subject to the provisions of the Judges' Pensions Act 1968, which provided better benefits than the 1948 Act. The lump sum remained available to a Solicitor-General with seven years service and no entitlement to a judge's pension. From 1988 the lump sum provision was replaced with an entitlement to a pro rata pension. This is the amendment which is now being rectified because, quite frankly, it was stuffed up in 1988.

         —The Government's amendment in 1988 did not follow its intention. If people look at what we are proposing, it comes through. In 1988, the intention in relation to the Solicitor-General was that, firstly, a Solicitor-General who serves at least seven years should receive a deferred pro rata pension discounted for the age before 60 at which he or she retires. The pro rata pension is calculated at the rate of 0.5 per cent per month for each month of service to a maximum of 60 per cent, discounted by 2 1/2 per cent for each year between retirement and age 60; payment is deferred until age 60. Secondly, a Solicitor-General will receive his or her pension unless he or she is removed from office. Receipt of a pension is not dependent on completion of a subsequent appointment.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The first element obviously sets out the qualifications for a pension. The second element establishes security of payment. The 1988 amendments were intended to give effect to those intentions. Unfortunately, they did not properly ensure the second element, and that is what we are now attempting to rectify.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, on examination of the Act, it is apparent that there is doubt whether a pension would be payable if a Solicitor-General were removed for incapacity, and a pension would not be not payable if a Solicitor-General were removed for bankruptcy. I repeat: at the moment the position is not clear. There is doubt whether a pension would be payable if a Solicitor-General were removed for incapacity and a pension would not be payable if a Solicitor-General were removed for bankruptcy. That places a Solicitor-General in a worse position than other public office holders with respect to the security of his pension.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Kooyong frowns, but let us look at the way other office holders are treated. The Judges' Pensions Act does not deny a pension to a judge who becomes bankrupt unless the judge is removed from office under section 72 of the Constitution and special provisions apply to a judge who retires because of ill health. The Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act, formerly the Parliamentary Retiring Allowances Act, preserves the pension entitlement of a member of parliament who is disqualified from holding office under section 44 (iii) of the Constitution by reason of bankruptcy or insolvency. A parliamentarian who retires because of ill health is entitled to a pension as a person who has not retired voluntarily from Parliament-subsection 18 (2) of the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act. The Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act is complex, but for most members the requirement is that they serve in at least three Parliaments in order to qualify for a minimum retiring allowance. Once they have qualified, they do not lose their allowance by reason of incapacity or bankruptcy and payment of a parliamentary retirement allowance is not deferred until age 60.
       </para>
       <para>
        The new amendments that we are proposing in this Bill are simply intended to bring the position of the Solicitor-General into line with the other public sector pension schemes in respect of the security of his pension. At present, I repeat, the Act provides that a pension will only be payable to a Solicitor-General whose term of office has expired and who has not been reappointed. Therefore a Solicitor-General who retires or is removed before the end of a term of office after having served a minimum of seven years does not qualify for a pension. Such a result is unconscionable. As I say, it is inconsistent with the treatment of other public office holders such as judges and ourselves as parliamentarians. I ask the honourable member for Kooyong to reconsider his proposed amendment. The position is simple: we stuffed it up in 1988; we are attempting to rectify it at the moment.

         —I intervene in this debate because presently the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) will introduce further amendments to his Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 to amend the Privacy Amendment Act 1990 which, in turn, amended the Privacy Act 1988. On behalf of the Government, the previous speaker, the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), freely confessed that the Government had `stuffed up'-those are his words-other parts of this legislation. He may well say that in relation to the amendments which are about to come forward. Unfortunately, it seems to be a common occurrence with this Government's performance, which seems to go back to at least 1988, and is continuing in fine tradition.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        When the Privacy Amendment Act 1990 came in it was designed to regulate the reporting of credit information. It was first introduced some time in June 1989 by the then Minister for Consumer Affairs, Senator Bolkus. Honourable members should bear that date in mind as that is when the legislation we are now amending first came into the Parliament. It still has not come into operation. So we are now amending legislation that has been in this Parliament since June 1989, which still has not come into effect, which still is not right and which still has to be amended before it can take effect.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the Bolkus administration the Bill lay on the Senate table for quite some time; then Senator Tate came into the portfolio. Senator Tate is a much more sensible Minister than Senator Bolkus, and he did take out some of the worst effects of the Bolkus Bill. By September 1990 Senator Tate was saying in press releases that he had widely consulted for 15 months on the Bolkus proposal. He made an announcement that there would be substantial amendments to the Bolkus proposal. In his press release of 20 September 1990 Senator Tate said, `This marks the completion of an exhaustive series of consultations and negotiations'. `Exhaustive' is partially right; exhausting is more correct. In September 1990 Senator Tate had completed his exhaustive negotiations and had a raft of amendments by that time.
       </para>
       <para>
        By the time the Bill came to this House for debate on 5 December 1990, notwithstanding that Senator Tate had completed his exhaustive consultations in September 1990, it had had further amendments. In the Senate the Opposition moved 50 amendments and the Government accepted 10; the Government moved about 40 of its own amendments. By 4 December 1990 the Government was almost ready to proceed with its legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill was to come into operation as soon as it was proclaimed to commence or upon the expiry of nine months after the assent. The date of assent was 24 December 1990. The Government never proclaimed it, so it would have come into operation on 24 September 1991. Today-20 August 1991-we have amendments before us putting off the coming into effect of this Act and changing it substantially before it comes into operation.
       </para>
       <para>
        As far as I am aware, these amendments appeared yesterday, which is when I was given a confidential set. I had a briefing on these amendments at 5.30 this afternoon. In between yesterday, when I received the confidential set, and 5.30 this afternoon, they had changed. Now we have a raft of amendments to legislation that started in June 1989 and still has not come into effect. I am sure that if we waited another 24 hours we would have a few more amendments, and if we waited another two years we might be back to another 40 amendments. This legislation has been flawed from the outset.
       </para>
       <para>
        When this Bill was debated in the House on 4 December, I raised eight objections, none of which were answered. I read out letter after letter from industry groups which opposed it. On behalf of the Opposition I also put forward a private member's Bill, which was endorsed by industry group after industry group. Many of the failings of this legislation to which I adverted on 4 December have come back to haunt the Government in the amendments which the Attorney-General is about to move. This is a dog's breakfast of the worst order.
       </para>
       <para>
        It would be humorous if it did not have the capacity to affect just about every business in this country. It would be absolutely humorous if it were not dealing with the fact that this is the way in which banks can keep credit reports, credit unions can keep credit reports, building societies can keep credit reports and ordinary traders can get information on who they are dealing with. If it did not affect them dramatically in all those ways, it would be humorous. It really does stand as testimony to how poor this Government's legislative proposal is. I suppose that when Government members are worried about whether their Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is going to survive the month or the year, their minds are taken off legislation. The Government ought to try to focus its mind as far as it possibly can, even during the interregnum of this prime ministership, to getting the legislation right.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are still people who are making submissions in relation to this matter. I commend Australasian Medical Leasing and Victorian Medical Finance, which are still taking up the cudgels and working to improve this legislation. My position, and that of the Opposition, is as it always has been: there is a sensible answer to all this. It is offensive if credit reporters are keeping material, such as sexual preference, race or nationality, and it ought to be banned. But there is a legitimate role for the keeping of credit defaults and making it available to a wider class of person than this Act provides. In particular, I have named classes such as insurers, real estate agents and mercantile agencies, which have a legitimate interest in knowing about credit default. I say mercantile agencies not because they are mercantile agencies but because they can offer a service to small business by getting this information for them and advising them on credit risks and on how to go about collecting debts. We have consistently said that there is a case for wider application. We have also said that it is artificial to try to quarantine consumer credit reporting from commercial credit reporting. That is what this Bill attempts to do. It says that these are all the things we can do in reporting on consumer default, but we can go on at large in relation to commercial default. It is almost as if there is a separate market out there, whereby one area can be regulated and the rest can be left where the devil takes the hindmost.
       </para>
       <para>
        If it is important to protect privacy by excluding the recording of anti-social information, it ought to be protected across the board. There has never been a satisfactory explanation from this Government as to why that should not be the case. Indeed, in this legislation the breaking down of that artificial distinction is becoming apparent, because, as the Privacy Commissioner has worked on a code of conduct, and as people have put submissions to him, bit by bit the Government has had to concede that its whole scheme is flawed. This is legislation which is dying the death of a thousand cuts.
       </para>
       <para>
        If one measured this Bill against the Bolkus Bill, it would be unrecognisable. It ought to be a bit more unrecognisable. The Government could solve all its problems by withdrawing this legislation and voting for my private member's Bill. But that would be too much of an admission. I suppose that in two years time the honourable member for Banks will be sitting up there and saying, `Oh dear, we stuffed up the Law and Justice Amendment Bill 1991, but here is the Bill that is going to fix it all up'. We will read it and it will be the Costello financial disclosure Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member would be better advised to be honest at the outset. He is intelligent enough to know when things go wrong. He made an honest admission. He ought to stand up in this debate and make another honest admission. Why do we not get it right at the outset, rather than get it wrong at the outset and spend debate after debate and amendment after amendment fixing it up? Is getting it right at the outset a novel idea?
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Tate is a great improvement on Senator Bolkus. Senator Bolkus seems to make a habit of all of this. He had this magnificent political ad ban legislation, which is suffering the same fate. That is going to see the death by a thousand cuts. I would like to make an appeal to the Australian Democrats in the Senate. I know that some honourable members will think this will fall on deaf ears, but the Australian Democrats should make every effort not to be snowed by the Government on this.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Democrats have seen the trouble they get themselves into when they try to do deals for cheap political advantage. They did a deal on the political ad ban. The next thing we know, the Leader of the Australian Democrats is gone and the Party is in turmoil. We put to them all the problems with this particular legislation. We referred it to a Senate committee, we called in witnesses and the witnesses confirmed the problem. The Australian Democrats got snowed by the Government. They said, `It is all too hard; we will go with the Government'. They ought to bear this in mind, because the Government now admits that it was wrong.

         —It rents them by the hour and gets it wrong, and then the Australian Democrats have to wear the egg on their faces as well. I hope that they have a very careful look at this. I hope that whoever their spokesman is at the time is not snowed by the Government on these particular proposals. We will hold out to them this potential: if they decide to independently evaluate it for themselves, if they decide they are not going to take the Government's word for it, then every time the Government walks in and says the legislation is all right, they ought to bear in mind the admission from the honourable member for Banks about the Government stuffing up, because these assurances are not really worth as much as they appear to be worth on the face of it. They ought to bear this in mind when this legislation gets into the Senate.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        If the Australian Democrats consider it again, they should come back to us. We will cooperate with them in producing a workable alternative. The best part about these amendments-and this is the basic reason why we will not oppose them-is to be found in a section that appeared on my 5.30 p.m. draft. This appeared in my 5.30 p.m. draft; not on yesterday's draft. It effectively said that the Act is not going to apply until 25 February 1992. That is the best thing that can be said: we put it all off again for five months. It is not a bad strike record.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the Bolkus legislation of June 1989 cannot come into operation by August of 1991, we will support an extension to put it off until February 1992. Indeed, if the Attorney-General wants in February to put it off for another six months, I will hold out to him in February of next year our agreement to that as well. That is the best part about this Bill-that, effectively, it will not operate at all until 25 February 1992. It is for that reason that we will not oppose these amendments; indeed, we will support them.
       </para>
       <para>
        We will also support them because they water down a flawed system and bit by bit we are getting closer to what we said all along. Although it is not the best legislation, it is moving in the right direction. Like some of the Attorney-General's racehorses, it is moving in the right direction-perhaps not crossing the post first, but at least moving in the right direction. So the Government will have our support on that particular matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a change as a result of these amendments, and I will review them very briefly. The change to the definition of a credit reporting business, which to some degree waters down the definition, means that some businesses that would have been caught incidentally under the previous Privacy Amendment Act 1990 will not be caught as a result. They will not be caught if they keep records for various purposes-unless that is the dominant purpose. That is a watering down of the definition. That is to be welcomed.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is also a provision, as a result of what is contained in 9c, for agents acting on behalf of credit providers who are engaged in tasks of processing loans or managing loans to effectively be subject to the same obligations and to have the same rights as credit providers under the Act. There is a bit of a widening there to pick up the agency position. Again, that is to be welcomed. There is also a provision that an individual who has a right of access under the legislation as it currently stands can authorise somebody else to obtain that information. That is what is provided by 9d. Again, there is a widening of the eligibility-something to be welcomed.
       </para>
       <para>
        Then we move on to some other amendments which deal with the question of the delineation between commercial and consumer credit. At the moment, an agency cannot give a report for use in assessing an application for commercial credit without written consent. This is a problem where people apply for loans over the telephone. If people applied for loans over the telephone, then the report which could be given would require written consent. Of course, the agency has not seen the person to get that written consent and does not have the ability to deal with things over the telephone. I am reliably informed that approximately 15 per cent of applications for loans are now made over the telephone.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is provided that, if there is an oral application for a loan, the report can be used in assessing the application until such time as the application is put in writing. When it is put in writing, then, presumably, written consent will be required. The amendments under section 18l provide that credit providers can use information about commercial credit worthiness to assess for individual credit without written agreement-again, where the application is made over the telephone.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are beginning to see a situation where the strict delineation between commercial credit and individual credit is breaking down. It is something that we always said was artificial, anyway. We are seeing a bit more flexibility there. It is a matter which will be of assistance to banks and we would certainly support it.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is also a provision for dealing with joint applications. Where a joint application for credit is made and refused on the basis of a credit report, both of the persons who formed part of the joint application can be informed about that and have the same rights, rather than one only.
       </para>
       <para>
        The major part of the amendments that the Attorney-General is going to move relates to section 18n of the Privacy Amendment Act 1990. That particular section deals with what can be done by a credit provider with reports. At the moment, I think, there are about eight categories of disclosure. The Attorney-General is going to amend another eight categories. That is not bad-that is a 100 per cent deviation from the current law. There were eight categories of allowable disclosure before; there will now be 16. I would not describe that as a technical or a minor amendment: it is a 100 per cent increase, but it is welcome nonetheless. It allows that there can be disclosure to all kinds of persons who would have been prohibited under the Government's Bill had it finally come into operation as the Government intended. Mortgage insurers, banking ombudsmen, State authorities, merchants who use Bankcards, secondary mortgage markets and the like-all would have been prevented from disclosure, but now they are not.
       </para>
       <para>
        We support the fact that this deviates even further from flawed legislation. We support the fact that it puts off the evil day of compliance. It gives businesses more time to reconcile themselves to this legislation. We deplore the circumstances in which it has come forward, but we take even this slight improvement as a sign of good faith. We urge greater activity on the part of the Government and the Minister to get the legislation right for the future.

         —in reply-It is difficult to know where to start in replying to the debate on the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill. Honourable members have gone across a pretty fair area tonight, and by `fair' I mean `large'. I thank those who participated in the debate, and I particularly thank the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) for giving a detailed explanation, one which I am sure has been understood in relation to the amendment of the Law Officers Act.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I often wonder what sort of a time an Attorney-General on this side of the House would have if that Attorney was not a person for whom the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) had a lot of respect. He certainly does give people plenty of trouble, despite the fact that he repeatedly indicates that he has a great deal of regard for one's integrity and all the rest of it. I thank him for all of that, but it does not stop him being extremely difficult. I do not think the honourable member will find what I am about to say offensive. I think the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) may, but be that as it may.
       </para>
       <para>
        The former honourable member for Menzies, Mr Neil Brown, was not someone I was ever close to personally. I am prepared to concede that he was a good lawyer, a far better lawyer than the honourable member for Kooyong and certainly a better lawyer than the honourable member for Holt. Neither of us, I think, finds that offensive. He was certainly a far better lawyer than the honourable member for Higgins. In that debate the former honourable member for Menzies may well have picked up something which a lot of people did not pick up. He referred to this provision as a `very curious provision'. He did not oppose it but he did find it curious. I wonder whether, in a somewhat strange way, he waited for it to come back and haunt us, which has turned out to be the case.
       </para>
       <para>
        In relation to that 1988 Bill, in somewhat colourful and unparliamentary language described by my good friend the honourable member for Banks-which I would not repeat, of course-it was intended that a Solicitor-General who serves at least seven years would receive a deferred pro rata pension discounted for the age before 60 at which he or she retires. The pro rata pension is calculated at the rate of 0.5 per cent per month for each month of service to a maximum of 60 per cent, discounted by 2.5 per cent for each year between retirement and age 60. Payment is deferred to age 60. A Solicitor-General will receive his or her pension unless he or she is removed from office. Receipt of the pension is not dependent upon completion of a subsequent appointment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The first element of that proposed intention of that Bill in 1988 sets the qualifications for a pension and the second establishes the security of payment. The amendments were intended to give effect to those intentions. They did not properly ensure the second element, and we are now rectifying that matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, on examination of the Law Officers Act, it is apparent that there is doubt whether a pension would be payable if a Solicitor-General were removed for incapacity, and a pension is not payable if a Solicitor-General is removed for bankruptcy. In respect of pension rights, the Solicitor-General should not be placed in any worse position than other public office holders with respect to the security of his or her pension. The honourable member for Banks dealt with that in detail, and dealt with other examples of other office holders. I will not go through that again, but I want to point out that that was the intention in 1988. It did not happen, which is why we are back here tonight.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is, however, one of the points that the honourable member for Kooyong was concerned about. I do not say this in any deprecatory way at all. He may not have fully appreciated the fact that there was no lump sum payment. I am not certain about that. I always had the impression that he may have thought there could have been at least a part lump sum payment. That is not the case. In fact, section 16(2) of the Law Officers Act, the section dealing with the pension of a Solicitor-General, reads:
       </para>
       <para>
        (2) If a person becomes a Judge and, at any time before his appointment as a Judge, he held office as Solicitor-General, the period of his service as Solicitor-General shall, for the purposes of sections 6 and 7 of the Judges' Pension Act 1968, be added to, and be deemed to be part of, his period of service as a Judge and:
       </para>
       <para>
        (a) if, at the time of his so becoming a Judge, he is in receipt of a pension by virtue of subsection (1)--that pension ceases to be payable;
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, if a Solicitor-General went back to the Bar after, say, serving eight years-not all of them become judges-that person would receive a pro rata pension entitlement as a result of the term as Solicitor-General. If he then goes back and practises at the bar and is later appointed to the Bench, that person gets a judicial salary and the pension payable as Solicitor-General stops. It would be paid then, of course, on retirement from the bench. It is not difficult to be confused about this. It is quite plain there was some confusion in 1988. It has been cleared up this evening, I hope, to the satisfaction of the honourable member for Kooyong.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Kooyong then ranged very widely across his favourite subject of the independence of the judiciary. He did not go back in time as far as he did on the previous occasion when we debated this matter, when we went back centuries and had an extremely learned dissertation on legal history, to the extent, may I say-and this is true-that it was only about a month ago that I wiped that debate off a tape which I had at home. It was not taken off accidentally; I had seen it once, and that was enough for me. I must say that I thought the dissertation that night on legal history was quite superb; on the question of the independence of the judiciary, though, not so good.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have not been inciting judges to attack the Government. I have been tempted tonight by the honourable member for Kooyong to be somewhat critical of the Government's attitude to judicial pensions. The honourable member cited the article by Sir Ninian Stephen referring to the evil of the erosion of judicial salaries, and he particularly made a point of stating that he considers that judicial salaries have developed in a chaotic and disorderly fashion. I want to make it quite plain that I think there is a fair bit of merit in what the honourable member for Kooyong says in respect of judicial salaries in this sense, and only in this sense. I think they are too low. The fact that I have said from time to time that I think the salaries of the Solicitor-General and the DPP are grossly inadequate is in no way indicating that I do not feel that judicial salaries in this country are also too low. There are differences which the honourable member for Kooyong and the judiciary have with me on this, the first one being the question of tenure, which he does not accept. I agree to disagree with him on that.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second one is something that I do not think we have touched upon in this debate before-the question of the package generally. I do not think one can look at a judicial salary just as a salary. If one takes the whole package it is a good deal more. That is not retracting what I said a moment ago. I still think judicial salaries are too low. When talking about going to the market to get officers for governments to operate in areas of enormous significance, such as the Solicitor-General and the DPP, I find it quite extraordinary that we have the Governor of the Reserve Bank who earns something of the order of $230,000, yet one could not get that sort of salary for a Solicitor-General or a DPP. That is where I disagree, and I put it on record tonight. I have said it publicly out of this place, so I might as well say it in here. I think it is ridiculous. In fact I do not think it is a position which should be allowed to continue.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having said that, I do not wish to continue with this area tonight. It was not an area I thought we would be debating again. One does have to give the honourable member for Kooyong a lot of credit for courage. I thought he was badly done over in the last debate, but he came up again tonight and battled away again. I congratulate him on his courage.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Higgins has a different problem; that is, lack of confidence. I think the hallmark of the honourable member in this place will be his overwhelming humility. He came in here tonight and said that we had watered down this Bill. I think his exact words were that the amendments water down the original Bill. They do not. They have been accepted on the privacy issue-a matter on which the honourable member was far too dismissive-by the Privacy Commissioner. There is no question that the Privacy Commissioner would not have done that had there been a watering down on the privacy issue. The honourable member suggested that the solution to the problem was that we should adopt the Costello Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Higgins is in a safe seat. He will be around for a long while. One day-it may be a long way in the future, unless he offends the party apparatchiks in Victoria-he will be in government and he will find that it is not quite that easy. The purpose of these amendments is to accommodate genuine concerns expressed by industry-which, in fairness, those opposite acknowledged-and also concerns which were put to the Privacy Commissioner on those matters after long consultation. I agree with that; I am aware of it. The amendments which I will be moving in the committee stage will amend the Privacy Act 1988 as amended by the Privacy Amendment Act 1990. We know that.

        The privacy area is difficult. When consulting with industry it is not easy to get it right. We think we do have it right. Those opposite say that it is now going in the right direction. I can assure those opposite that it is not as easy as having the honourable member for Higgins drafting an alternative Bill and saying that it will satisfy all concerns, particularly the privacy concerns, because it will not.
       </para>
       <para>
        The purpose of these amendments is to accommodate the concerns expressed by the credit reporting industry and the credit industry. Some of their accepted, legitimate practices would become technical breaches under the legislation. On that matter those opposite are correct, they would have been technically in breach when the legislation came into effect on 24 September this year unless this had been done.
       </para>
       <para>
        It has never been the intention of Senator Bolkus, Senator Tate or me to interfere or unnecessarily restrict the credit industry. The legislation that we are talking about, which amends the Privacy Act, was enacted to protect personal privacy by regulating the contents of credit information files. They contained only information that is relevant to assessments by credit providers of applicants' credit worthiness. This was necessary to prevent the practice of positive reporting, which we debated previously in this House.
       </para>
       <para>
        Other provisions were enacted to ensure that disclosure and use of information in relation to matters such as these, including between credit employers, is regulated to protect privacy of individuals in relation to their personal credit history. That is a matter of genuine concern on this side of the House. It is a matter on which we have been prepared to take constructive advice from time to time from the honourable member for Kooyong and the honourable member for Higgins. It is something that they ought to think about a bit more before they come in here and say, `Adopt the Costello Bill and we are all home, away and happy', because I do not think that is the case.
       </para>
       <para>
        The day to day regulation of credit reporting will be in accordance with the code of conduct being developed by the Privacy Commissioner under the legislation. In the course of consulting with the credit and credit reporting industries on the code of conduct, a range of practices were advised which, whilst unexceptional in themselves, would have been technical breaches. That was a big worry. That point was picked up by those opposite in their contribution this evening. The amendments are technical but not inconsequential. In some cases it was not clear that there would necessarily be a breach.
       </para>
       <para>
        When I looked at the submissions, I was not convinced that was always the case. But we all make a lot of mistakes; therefore, I think it is better to amend the legislation to put it beyond doubt so that the industry can get on with its business. This is consistent with the philosophy behind this legislation and the Government's intention to regulate credit reporting.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some of the changes that have been made are worth touching on in more detail. The honourable member for Higgins dealt with the changes one by one. The amendments, which pick up concerns about technical breaches, include matters of substance, such as ensuring that consent by individuals to disclosure of information which would otherwise be restricted can be given orally in the case of telephone applications for credit; making certain that credit card and the electronic funds transfer at point of sale transactions are not prevented by the legislation; recognising the standard practice of mortgage securitisation; and allowing individuals to authorise persons, including financial advisers and debt counsellors, to have access to their credit information. Agents of credit providers can have the same access as their principals where this is essential in the industry, but in such a case the agents will be prohibited from using that information for any purpose other than that for which the principal credit provider could use it. Credit providers will be permitted to use personal information for proper internal management purposes.
       </para>
       <para>
        The credit industry has also advised that it cannot meet the 24 September 1991 deadline. That was the view of the industry. As a result we have agreed-as those opposite indicated-to defer commencement to 25 February 1992. I think it is fair to say that a lot of the criticism and proposals from the industry were exceptionally good in the sense that it was constructive, but not all of it. It is not enough to say-as the honourable member for Higgins did-that there will always be submissions coming in. Of course there will be. This is something that was opposed from the start by those opposite. That is their right, that is what democracy is all about. Because letter after letter comes in from an industry which is obviously opposed to the legislation, that does not mean the legislation is fatally flawed. As I said, the legislation has been deferred until 25 February. However, some protection will be guaranteed to individuals from 24 September; for example, their rights to access -that is section 18h-and strict requirements of accuracy of information held by credit reporting agencies and credit providers.

        The amendments that have been circulated in my name will be moved in the committee stage. Because of the way the debate has progressed, I thought it would be better to respond to both the honourable member for Kooyong and the honourable member for Higgins at this stage. No doubt we will have an opportunity at a later date to discuss the matter of salaries and judicial independence more fully when it is slightly more relevant to the Bill in question. I again thank those who have contributed to the debate this evening.

         —The amendments to the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill effectively amend the Privacy Amendment Act 1990 and through that the Privacy Act 1988. I directed my comments during the second reading debate to the amendments that have now been moved. For the reasons I indicated then, we will be supporting the amendments. I will not be moving any further amendments on behalf of the Opposition because we have been down that road. We have put our amendments and they have been rejected one by one. Had our amendments been accepted then, these Government amendments would not have been necessary.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I ought to take up one point made by the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) in his laconic and endearing reply. At great length he pronounced upon the knowledge of constitutional history of the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), his own knowledge of the law, the knowledge of the law of the honourable member for Kooyong, the knowledge of the law of the former member for Menzies, and everybody else's knowledge of the law, in his usual impartial and endearing laconic manner, delivering his words with mock seriousness which unfortunately cannot be recorded by the Hansard reporters.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Attorney-General made the point that we should not be surprised that letter after letter from an industry came in opposing this particular message. I do not think he fully appreciated the point I made during my comments on the privacy legislation. I was not saying that the Credit Reporting Agency of Australia was opposed to this, although it was. I was saying that the whole of Australian industry was opposed to it. On 5 December 1990 I indicated some of the groups that were opposed to it. I read out a letter from the Australian Institute of Credit Management and a press release from the Credit Reporting Forum. That happened to comprise the Australian Chamber of Commerce, the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, the Australian Federation of Credit Unions, the Australian Institute of Credit Management, the Australian Retailers Association, the Confederation of Australian Industry, the Insurance Council of Australia and the Retail Traders Association of New South Wales.
       </para>
       <para>
        I was not saying that the credit industry had written in complaining about this; I was saying that the whole of Australian industry had written in complaining about it. Indeed, I read into the Hansard the views those bodies had expressed upon the proposal I put forward. The Attorney-General said, `It's not as simple as you say to support your Bill', as if I was putting forward some legislation that had not received any endorsement at all. It had been endorsed by all of those bodies. It was not a simple Bill. It was a Bill that struck a good balance. It was not as if we were saying, `Here is a one-page Bill that can be enacted and will fix the problem'. This was a Bill which had been drawn by an expert. I think Professor Jack Richardson, the Commonwealth Ombudsman, did the first model which we introduced and which had won support from all of those organisations.
       </para>
       <para>
        To turn the argument around, it is not as simple as saying, `We cannot accept that particular Bill because we're the only ones who have wrestled with this issue and all of the criticisms are coming from the industry which happens to be regulated'. The Government cannot take that position. The position was that the whole of Australian industry was opposed to this legislation and galvanised behind the proposals we put forward, which struck an adequate balance of privacy.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I made clear when I was addressing this matter, credit reporting should not contain information as to race, ethnic origin, et cetera. We were prepared to ban that. In many respects, the proposal we put forward went further in the protection of privacy. It protected privacy in relation to credit reporting on commercial credit, not just consumer credit, as this Bill does, although the amendments that are being moved now are breaking down the delineation in the ways I have described. So it is not accurate to put the argument as the Attorney-General put it in reply.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is a complicated issue but, as I indicated before, we have been wrestling with it since 1989. We are still amending the legislation, even though it has not been proclaimed. I was reiterating the position the Opposition had taken-a position that commanded much greater support than did the Government's position. For the Government to say, `We will listen to the Opposition's views, because after all we have to; they are the Opposition and they are entitled to speak' is to be far too dismissive of the legitimate concerns that were raised and the widespread views we represented in the debate in this Parliament. I feel I should make that clear.
       </para>
       <para>
        For the reasons I have already given, we will be supporting the amendments. We will not take the time of the Parliament to put our own amendments again because we know what their fate would be. I reiterate that those amendments were well thought out. They were cogent, they protected privacy, and they had a ground swell of support in the Australian community.

         —I accept that the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) wanted to make the point about support for his Bill, as he referred to it earlier. He mentioned the comments made on the Government's legislation and the proposals put forward by Mr Richardson. I am well aware of them because this issue was one of the first things I had to look at after the 1990 election. The matters raised, particularly by Professor Richardson at that stage, caused the Government to look at this matter again. When the new Government came in, Senator Tate also looked at it again. We have had to make these amendments, as has been indicated tonight, and we are grateful that the time of the Parliament is not going to be taken up by further amendments because the honourable member for Higgins has indicated that it is now moving in the right direction.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        However, I do not know that the point has been properly taken by the Opposition. Of course industry has opposed this legislation, and this whole process we have got to tonight has come about as a result of the tortuous but nevertheless necessary consultation that has gone on. At the end of the day the Privacy Commissioner has been able to say, when looking at these amendments, that they do not change the protection given to individuals by the original legislation in any way that would be regarded as threatening individual privacy.
       </para>
       <para>
        While people say that both parties move a little closer together from time to time on some issues, it is sometimes on this sort of issue that there is a fundamental difference. We have been prepared to respond to the industry's concerns, as I have indicated, but we have not been prepared to go as far in that regard as the honourable member for Higgins may have been prepared to go because philosophically we do not agree with it. Whilst the Bill the honourable member for Higgins refers to-that is, the Opposition's Bill-may have more industry support, at this stage we are not prepared to go that far. For that reason, he is correct: had those amendments been moved, we would not have accepted them. Nevertheless, it is pleasing that the amendments we are moving tonight, arrived at after consultation with industry and of course the Privacy Commissioner, will be accepted by the Opposition.

         —We seem to have spent most of today fixing up legislation that had been rushed through this House by this Government in the dying moments of previous sessions. The Arts, Sport, Environment and Tourism Legislation Amendment Bill 1991, which is part of this process, highlights a couple of disturbing facts: firstly, the growing tendency for this Government to present to the Parliament legislation which just has to be patched up from time to time; and secondly, the confusion created by the Government's approach to public administration through the system of dual ministries. This latter situation could not be made clearer than by looking at the tourism portfolio-one of the portfolios which is subject to this Bill.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons) is responsible for the day to day administration of the tourism portfolio. I pay tribute to the professional and bipartisan approach that he has adopted towards his ministerial duties. The entire tourism industry is quite aware of the manner in which the Minister has endeavoured to advance its interests.
       </para>
       <para>
        But, unfortunately, the Minister plays a subordinate role to that of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly). That Minister is compelled to devote her energies to the political, economic and social minefield of the environment while hoping her other responsibilities will be handled with a minimum of fuss by junior colleagues. This has resulted in little policy direction being given to the tourism industry from within Cabinet. The portfolio Minister, still with enough spare time to promote the two greatest lost causes of modern Australia-the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) and the Canberra Raiders-has failed to provide the policy and administrative leadership that is so necessary.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has determined that the environment ministry is worthy of representation in the Cabinet, I am at a loss to comprehend why similar treatment should not be afforded to the tourism portfolio, which is Australia's biggest private sector employer. Not only is it Australia's biggest private sector employer but also, indeed, it is the biggest earner of foreign income for Australia. Tourism is worth more than $6 billion annually-much more than traditional rural export industries or, in fact, our manufacturing industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        The tourism industry employs between 500,000 and 600,000 Australians. This is something which should not be ignored in the face of the present unemployment figures of 830,000 officially unemployed and the real figure probably coming in at more than one million.

         —I will, Mr Deputy Speaker. Until something is done to correct this policy paralysis, we will have to come back with more and more of these amendments. There is an increasing tendency to present legislation in this haphazard fashion. We really must get on top of this. There is no clearer evidence of this than what is happening here tonight. The first thing we have to do is change the actual title of the Bill. While the second series of amendments is of minor consequence, it indicates the depths to which this Government's decision making powers have descended.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In its supplementary explanatory memorandum the Government admits that one particular amendment-to apply the Bill to the National Capital Planning Authority-`was accidentally omitted from the Bill as introduced'. Clearly, Ministers have other things on their minds and are obviously unable to devote their intellectual resources to the drafting of legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The impact of this is evident in the Government's decision that the Remuneration Tribunal should have jurisdiction over the recreation leave entitlements of various office holders in statutory authorities. This is despite the fact that similar changes were proposed in relation to other portfolios in the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991. Unfortunately, the Minister has failed to indicate why these amendments were not introduced in the earlier legislation. That sort of legislative consistency would do much to reassure the Government's ever decreasing band of supporters that there is some semblance of efficiency remaining in its ranks.
       </para>
       <para>
        There appears to be no sound reason why that Bill should not have encompassed the changes now being made. This example of inefficiency and the attendant administrative costs cannot simply be brushed aside. Legislation by instalment will never be a prescription for good government. The Government must make a public commitment to get its house in order, to streamline its legislative processes and to put an end to this waste and inefficiency.
       </para>
       <para>
        In relation to the proposed relationship between the Remuneration Tribunal and 13 statutory authorities, this is obviously the case. In regard to the Australian Tourist Commission-the only amendment falling directly within my shadow ministerial responsibilities-I would like to record my admiration for the way in which the Commission is fulfilling its responsibilities. The Commission has contributed much to the growth of tourism throughout this country; by harnessing the industry's resources and promoting its strengths, it has been of great assistance.
       </para>
       <para>
        While there can be no complaint about the intent of the particular amendment in the case of ATC, as opposed to the timing, the same cannot be said about some of the further proposed changes. Upon closer examination these amendments are revealed to be the products of either sloppy drafting or sloppy decision making. Within the environment portfolio, leave entitlements of the Chairman of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, the Director of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Supervising Scientist will fall within the responsibilities of the Remuneration Tribunal.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the same time it is proposed to amend the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act to double from $4,000 to $8,000 the maximum fee fixed by regulation for applications and notices in relation to export and import permits under the Act. This is a cost recovery exercise to which we have no objection as the $8,000 charge is a maximum fee only and need not be imposed in full. The industry accepts that the amount of work required to evaluate applications and sites for disposing of hazardous waste to meet stringent international requirements warrants such a change.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, concern has been raised that there exists an absolute discretion as to the time limit applying to a licence. The licence period may not be for 12 months, requiring companies to reapply two, three or four times in one year. Consequently the reasonable $8,000 fee could become quite unreasonable if it resulted in applicants having to pay over $32,000 a year. I seek an assurance from the Minister that this discretion will not be exercised to the disadvantage of applicant companies.
       </para>
       <para>
        A significant series of amendments, if passed, would result in five statutory authorities having the value limit beyond which they need to obtain ministerial approval for contracts and other transactions increased to $250,000. These authorities include the Australia Council, the Australian Film, Television and Radio School, the Australian National Maritime Museum, the Australian National Gallery and the National Museum of Australia. The Opposition has yet to be convinced of the worth of these amendments.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government suggests in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill that the changes are necessary as this `accounts for several years inflation'. I think this explanation is difficult to accept. An inflation linked limit in most instances would have risen to only $193,000-$57,000 less than is presently being sought. It would appear that the Government is simply seeking to provide these bodies with the same limit as has been applied to the National Library since last year. If the reason is administrative convenience, that should have been admitted. To hide behind any other spurious reason does the Government no credit.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition has noted that the Attorney-General has continually objected to breaches of existing limits. His general view is that limits should be determined by the merits of each case, not on arbitrary figures that suit the supervising departments. All limits are subject to change by regulation, yet in no instance has this ever been done. It is incumbent on the Minister to explain the background to these changes. The Opposition will move amendments in the Senate to bring the amounts within the bounds of a realistic inflation adjustment.
       </para>
       <para>
        These amendments also concern the composition of the boards of a number of statutory authorities. While these matters are under consideration, I believe it is appropriate to raise two further issues. First, the Opposition believes that the imposition of arbitrary age limits for board members is no longer appropriate. Age of itself should not be a disqualifying factor in determining service on the board of a statutory authority. There is no place for age discrimination in contemporary society. Government should take the lead and insist upon performance as the sole criterion for serving in this capacity. We know that this issue has been raised time and time again both in this House and in the other place. It is interesting that if we go through the Hansard record of 12 September 1990, almost 12 months ago, we see that when the Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts raised the issue of age discrimination with the Minister, Senator Richardson, there was quite a debate. At that time Senator Richardson actually gave this commitment:
       </para>
       <para>
        There is an imperative on the Government to act, and the Government will act. The Attorney-General plans to issue a discussion paper on this matter within the next three months. Then a further round of consultations will take place and legislation can come in next year.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was all about the issue of age discrimination, but to my knowledge these things have never been done. My colleague Senator Baume will pursue our amendments in the Senate and I trust the Government will give consideration to accepting them.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second point relates to the ability of a board to stand down members who are the subject of criminal charges or whose conduct is the subject of some form of judicial inquiry. Recent events concerning the membership of the Australian Tourist Commission and the National Gallery point to the urgency of this particular matter. There is the standard which has been accepted in relation to members of parliament by this side of the House for many years. It is also the standard that the Labor Premier of Queensland, Mr Goss, followed in Opposition, as evidenced by his call for the standing down of members of parliament, police officers and public servants adversely named before the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct.
       </para>
       <para>
        For the sake of consistency and to ensure that the highest possible standards of public administration are maintained, boards of Commonwealth authorities should have the power to suspend members facing criminal charges. Clearly, no such member should lose any rights, privileges or seniority in the event of the Crown being unable to establish its case. This is a necessary reform which the Government must treat seriously and it is one that the Opposition will pursue.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe it is legitimate to draw to public attention the administrative shortcomings this Bill reveals. At the same time the Government should have taken this opportunity to proceed with even more significant reform of public administration. Despite the inadequacies, the Opposition will not oppose these amendments, but looks forward to a more detailed explanation by the Minister and hopefully some further action when this Bill reaches the other place.

         —We have before us the Arts, Sport, Environment and Tourism Legislation Amendment Bill 1991, which the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons) introduced in June this year and to which I understand some amendments will be made, for very good reason. Having looked at the Bill, there are some omissions through error but I think there are also some changes that the Government felt were necessary after it had looked at the legislation during the recess.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        When the Minister introduced the Bill on 21 June, he spoke on a number of matters; for instance, measures such as giving the Remuneration Tribunal jurisdiction over the recreation leave entitlements of full time office holders and also raising various statutory authorities' value limits beyond which they needed to obtain ministerial approval for contracts and other transactions, with an increase generally to $250,000. Examples were the Australia Council, the Australian Film, Television and Radio School, the Australian National Maritime Museum, the Australian National Gallery and the National Museum of Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are other matters of importance-for instance, an officer of the Royal Australian Navy will be an ex-officio member of the council of the National Maritime Museum; section 49 of the Australian National Maritime Museum Act, which exempts the museum from taxation, should be clarified; and, further, three representatives of the convocation of the Australian Film, Television and Radio School on the council of the school should be appointed by the council rather than be elected by the convocation. It was felt that it was becoming somewhat difficult to conduct an effective election among convocation, which now has 1,000 members.
       </para>
       <para>
        Other matters included allowing bodies such as the Protection of Moveable Cultural Heritage Committee to hold their meetings by conference telephone and similar methods. That has been a revolution in all sorts of various tribunals within the Commonwealth aegis, who have found that they can readily hold conferences by telephone. This simply enables them to do that.
       </para>
       <para>
        Briefly, we would also increase to $20,000 the value of material that the Australian National Maritime Museum and the National Museum of Australia may dispose of without ministerial approval. The original amendment proposed that the amount be raised from $10,000 for the Maritime Museum and $5,000 for the National Museum.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is simply a reflection of inflation, of course, that these amounts should be lifted in order to bring them up to current dollar values. I think, if I heard correctly from the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), that he was somewhat critical of that. But really, our best measurement of those matters would indicate that those dollar amounts should be lifted and made more relevant to today's dollar figures, and hopefully they will not need to be amended in the near future, because we have been through this exercise a couple of times.
       </para>
       <para>
        I mentioned that an officer of the Royal Australian Navy should be appointed to the Council of the Australian National Maritime Museum. That, of course, is a ready recognition that the Navy is an important part of the maritime experience of Australians and that one of the key themes in the museum's ongoing exhibitions is devoted to the Navy. So we think it is only right that the Royal Australian Navy be represented on the Council of the Australian National Maritime Museum.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another matter to do with dollars and the levels of payments was that we should raise the limit on contracts requiring ministerial approval for the Australia Council, the Australian National Maritime Museum and the National Museum of Australia from $100,000 to $250,000, and for the Australian Film, Television and Radio School from $50,000 to $250,000, again, purely to reflect the increase in inflation over the time since these amounts were last adjusted. I might note that the $50,000 limit for the Australian Film, Television and Radio School has been unchanged since 1973, so that an increase of that amount is well and truly overdue. The limit of $100,000 was set for the National Museum of Australia in 1980; it also is overdue for change. The $100,000 limit for the Australia Council was set by the Australia Council Amendment Act 1991, and the $100,000 limit for the National Maritime Museum was set in 1990. But we felt of course that these limits were inadequate for both the authorities and that there was a need to increase them to $250,000 just to ensure that there is no need to further amend their Acts again in the near future.
       </para>
       <para>
        In giving further illustration of the necessity to increase some of these limits, I might say that I think there was some quibble by the Opposition about the exact measurement of inflation over the period and whether or not we should only allow our limits to rise to $200,000. But we felt that we should be slightly ahead of the game and that a limit of $250,000 would be a decent reflection of inflationary change and also that it would ensure that there would not be the need for immediate and further amendment in the near future.
       </para>
       <para>
        Very briefly I will go to a couple of other points before I allow the Minister to speak on this matter, because I know that he is keen to do so. I remember that there was some debate last time and in other amendments to legislation under this portfolio about the age limits which were placed on people taking positions on these various councils. There was a time when we preferred and were encouraging the Attorney-General to review the whole question of age discrimination and age limits on Commonwealth appointments, and we still are encouraging him, because we were very conscious that we did not want to discriminate on the appointment of anyone who, for instance, had turned age 65. For a time, we had left that to the Attorney-General. But I understand that the Minister for Arts, Tourism and Territories has been successful in arguing the case on this particular amendment Bill and wishes to put further amendments I think in the Senate; but of course I will let him mention those matters when he rises to speak.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would conclude on just one other matter. There is some debate about the National Gallery Act of 1975. The limits for acquisitions not works of art are to be increased from $100,000 to $250,000 and the limits for the disposals are to shift from $50,000 to $250,000. We are conscious that that is a fairly large move, but it is an increase that reflects inflation and the scale of the operations of the gallery as a large and very complex organisation. I really think that the change will increase administrative efficiency. I might note in passing that the gallery is already required to report in its annual report any disposals of works of art under subsection 40(2), which was added to the portfolio Bill in November 1990. So I think people can be reassured that the people and the Parliament will be given proper notice of disposals of works by the gallery, and I think we are quite safe in lifting the limits for acquisitions and disposals to $250,000.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendments are minor but important. I think they have been given due recognition in debate this evening and I commend them to the House.

         —I just wish to speak briefly on the Arts, Sport, Environment and Tourism Legislation Amendment Bill 1991, which touches on a number of the areas for which I have responsibility in the Opposition. Most of those areas relate to extending the authority of the Remuneration Tribunal. The Opposition has no objection to that and I do not think it requires any comment. But there is one provision of the Bill which I think touches on the fundamental malaise that afflicts this country, and I do want to make some comment about that.

        The Bill amends the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1990, which ratifies the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal. I think it is a very interesting parable about Australia in 1991 that we send our intractable wastes to the United Kingdom. There is the United Kingdom, small and heavily populated, and we go through the most extraordinarily complex procedures to ship from this country hazardous wastes which will be dealt with in that country. It is a reminder that we have been incapable so far of coming to a national decision about the disposal of hazardous wastes.

        I want to make it absolutely clear that I support what the Commonwealth Government in conjunction with the Victorian and New South Wales governments has been attempting to do, which is to establish a location for a high temperature incinerator. I think that all governments, without regard to their political complexion, have been trying to come to grips with a significant issue that should be dealt with and, indeed, should have been dealt with before this.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think that if we want an illustration of what is wrong with Australia, we do not have to go beyond this Act and the fact that we are pushing up the licence fee from a maximum of $4,000 to a maximum of $8,000, because it is a complex matter-and the Opposition concedes that-in making sure that before someone exports this waste we meet our international commitments and are not sending it off to some underdeveloped country where it will do great harm. But I ask the House to reflect upon the situation where, in this wide brown land of three million square miles and 17 million people, a very large number of people seem to think it is beyond us to have a facility which will deal with this problem.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have 10 per cent unemployment; we have close to 30 per cent youth unemployment; we have abysmal capital investment figures. I really weep for my country. If we want an explanation as to why we are in this perilous position, it is because we seem to be incapable of making decisions simply to get on with the job.
       </para>
       <para>
        Why is it that small, highly populated countries can undertake this task within their boundaries and we cannot? It is a classic illustration of why we are in the mess we are in. I do not lay all the blame at the feet of the Government. As I say, I actually support the Government's procedures whereby it is trying, with the relevant State governments, to come to grips with this problem-and look at the opposition it is receiving. It does not come just from pea green environmentalists; it comes from some of the most conservative sectors of the community. We find our farming community in New South Wales and local authorities throughout New South Wales and Victoria, as I understand it, saying, `Somewhere else; not in my backyard'.
       </para>
       <para>
        The expert committee which put forward the original solution was made up of representatives of those governments and the ACF, and I am pleased that the ACF chose to get involved in what is a very contentious procedure, that it tried to find a solution instead of finding objections to something. But it does seem just too typical of what I described in the early part of my comments as our national malaise.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Federal Opposition has at no time tried to make any political capital out of the strong community feeling which has developed on this issue. Rather, it has tried to contribute to finding a solution, because Australia must find a solution to these issues and must unlock the capacity of Australia to do things. On behalf of the Opposition, I give my general support to this legislation, but I ask the House of Representatives to ponder why it is that we have to send intractable waste to the United Kingdom and why, to this point, we have found ourselves incapable of dealing with this issue within our own boundaries.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is not the appropriate time to list and to deal with in detail the many other areas of national paralysis, but I put on record on this Budget day my belief that Australia is very good at doing certain things. We are very good at resource development; we are very good miners; we are good foresters. We have the capacity to be a major force in the world resources industry, but we have reached the point where our major resource companies are investing overseas. Look at what BHP is proposing over the next couple of years and ponder why so much of the investment is in South America, Asia and Africa. Look at the recent investment of CRA in east Kalimantan, where it is going to produce coal which has a calorific value better than Queensland coal and with lower impurities.
       </para>
       <para>
        At a time of what I regard as national crisis we should be continually directing our minds to the reality that this country has become paralysed. It is simply not investing, it is not growing, it is not creating jobs for its young, it is not creating jobs for its old, and this Bill is a very small mark of our failure.

         —I am delighted to support the comments made by my colleagues the shadow Minister for tourism and aviation, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), and the shadow Minister for the environment, the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney). Once again we are debating a Bill to make housekeeping amendments to some 15 Acts which are already in place. It is high time that this tired Labor Government and its lame duck leadership put itself to sleep once and for all and allowed a bit of competence and efficiency to surface.

        It appears that there is no sound reason why the changes being made by the Arts, Sport, Environment and Tourism Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 could not have been encompassed in the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991. Such a move would have been efficient and administratively smart. The costs involved in introducing two Bills when one would have sufficed are extremely wasteful. I wonder how many respite care hours it cost for the introduction and passage of this second Bill. Furthermore, I wonder how many important Bills will be guillotined at the end of this session because we waste time today debating a machinery Bill to correct drafting errors made in haste.
       </para>
       <para>
        The specific amendment relating to the Australia Council Act 1975 is a classic case in point. For the second time in 12 months, agreement is sought to increase the limit under which the Australia Council may enter into contracts without first seeking ministerial approval. Questions must surely arise as to the need for such change when the mechanism already exists and provision has already been made for an expansion of limits by simple registration. Furthermore, it would appear that the limits currently in place for several bodies have continually been breached. Will the changes proposed in this Bill make any difference to the activities of these bodies or will infringement of limits continue to be a regular occurrence?
       </para>
       <para>
        Government has a responsibility to show restraint in expenditure. It has a responsibility to ensure that the statutory bodies over which it retains control contain their urge to breach the contractual limits placed upon such bodies. The Australia Council has an annual budget this financial year of $60.1m for the funding of arts and heritage programs throughout Australia, plus an allocation of $6.9m for the Australian Opera. The Council has the responsibility of allocating public moneys directed towards elevating the standard of the arts in Australia. At the same time the Council must ensure that genuine arts bodies and artists are funded in order to maximise public access and benefit. The objective of the Australia Council is quite clearly enunciated in today's Budget:
       </para>
       <para>
        To foster a strong artistic life throughout the nation by promoting excellence in and development of the arts and public use of them, and through that to foster our national identity and national confidence.
       </para>
       <para>
        I understand that the Government does not actually direct the Council as to where it is to allocate funds, but when I study the list of specific groups that actually receive grants there are some very curious names that crop up continually. For the two years to June 1990 appear names such as the Australian Council of Trade Unions, in excess of $200,000; the Gippsland Trades and Labour Council, $83,710; the United Trades and Labour Council of South Australia, $103,464; the Trades and Labour Council of Queensland, $114,268; the Trades and Labour Council of Western Australia, $89,279; the Victorian Trades Hall Council, $102,026; plus numerous other trades and labour councils across Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is taxpayers' money being given by a Labor Government to its union bed mates. It is no wonder that the genuine arts bodies in Australia are screaming for a bigger slice of the action. How much more public money is being siphoned off to union organisations by quasi-government authorities under the guise of the environmental, arts, sport and tourism grants that are supposedly to target those areas in most need. That is a good question.
       </para>
       <para>
        Administrative costs for the Australia Council are around 10 per cent of total budget and the Council claims to run a very lean organisation. Many community groups benefit from the grants provided through the Australia Council, but many also miss out, as is obvious by those recipients named previously. The unions in this country certainly have their hands in the cookie jar.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the same time that money is being handed out so readily to this Government's mates in the unions, we have another questionable situation in the Australian film industry. Funding to the Film Finance Corporation for the forthcoming year has been cut by $5m. Yet the bureaucracy that is Film Australia has been given an increase of $6.8m, with a further projected increase in 1992-93 of $5.9m.
       </para>
       <para>
        Where is the justice? The Government cuts funding in an area which is supportive of private investment and gives an increase to Film Australia for the Australian national interest program. Why is such a large increase provided for a single program? Is it really national interest or is it perhaps Labor Party interest, with public moneys being expended on Government propaganda? It is imperative that such programs of national interest are closely monitored to ensure that the interests of taxpayers in general are being considered and not just those of a minority pressure group.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have a viable film industry in Australia and it would be beneficial to this country if it continued to grow and prosper. Arts funding in Australia is big business. Let us ensure that it is directed accurately to the areas of most need and for mutual community benefit. The Australian Film, Television and Radio School conducts training in television, film and radio production via a three-year degree program as well as extension courses in specialised areas.
       </para>
       <para>
        The appointment from convocation by council of three council members would appear to assist in the streamlining of the council's function and, as such, we do not oppose the amendment. Trimming the bureaucracy and reducing wasted staff time is always commendable. It is important that when such authorities are put in place-and hopefully there will be fewer of them in the future-the mechanics of such elections and/or appointments will be considered in a practical and realistic manner. Government has a responsibility not only to be seen to be efficient but also, more importantly, to actually be efficient. This amendment will, hopefully, ensure a minor correction in the right direction.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is extremely disappointing to note that this Government is still attempting to practise discrimination against senior members of our community by introducing an age limit of 65 for chairmen of the Australia Council and members of the Australian Film Commission, the Australian National Maritime Museum council and the Australian Sports Drug Agency. Age must never be used as an excuse for denying a competent individual the eligibility to participate in the many Australian Government authorities that carry considerable influence in the community. Australia needs the experience and maturity of the many active and accomplished senior members of our society in the decision making boardrooms of our statutory authorities.

        The Australian Tourist Commission has an extremely crucial role to play as we head towards the twenty-first century and tourism becomes increasingly important as an earner of foreign currency. My electorate of La Trobe encompasses some of the most beautiful areas of national park, national forest, mountain views and patchwork hills in the whole of Australia. Yet local municipalities are starved of road dollars that would make major tourist routes safer and more attractive to those who visit us.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia needs to entice international tourists to visit and to encourage Australians to travel within their own country. La Trobe needs tourists to boost our depleted employment opportunities-not just depleted but almost annihilated by the policies of this Government. I note in that respect that our CES office last month recorded the greatest increase in unemployment in the whole of Australia. That is a great shame.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am pleased to note that the Commonwealth funding for the tourism industry has increased over the last decade in accordance with Budget Paper No. 1.

         —Tonight I wish to speak on three aspects of the Arts, Sport, Environment and Tourism Legislation Amendment Bill. The first aspect that I would like to address is the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1990. Given unprecedented political development around the world over the past couple of years-in fact, days-I have to confess a certain uneasiness about the way in which other matters seem to have taken the back burner in people's minds of late. Environmental problems which took such a high profile a few years ago have not miraculously disappeared despite the seeming moving away from public discussion on environmental issues.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I think it is worth while for me to take the time of the House to explain the background in which the hazardous waste subject was brought before the House. The global problem of hazardous waste was brought to the public's attention with the publicity surrounding ships such as the Zenobia, the Khian Sea and the Karin B roaming the high seas in search of a port to off-load their toxic cargoes. Attention focused on the dumping of toxic wastes from major industrial powers, in particular to smaller Third World countries. Some here tonight might remember these ships being denied entry to ports on four continents.
       </para>
       <para>
        The problem was first brought under scrutiny through a proposed OECD agreement in 1984 and then by the United Nations environment program, UNEP, which took over the work in 1987. At the same time, steps were being taken for a control mechanism within our own region, in particular within the Association of South East Asian Nations. Lengthy articles appeared in Time and Newsweek drawing attention to the increasing profile that this environmental matter was receiving in international fora.
       </para>

        Under this pressure and under the auspices of UNEP, the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal was developed and its final session was approved by 105 of the 116 participating countries. These facts have to be constantly brought before this House. The Basel convention was the first attempt for the world to approach this problem and Australia was there at the beginning. When we are talking of details of hazardous wastes here, we should consider no petty nit-picking around the edge but remember that in this subject we are dealing with a major, worldwide environmental problem.
       </para>
       <para>
        Although I do not necessarily endorse all that the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) has said on this subject, I do say that the onus on countries exporting their hazardous waste is of vital concern to this Parliament, even though we are discussing it late on Budget night. We know that it was introduced into the Australian Parliament in 1989 and we know that it was Australia's attempt to formally legitimise its cooperation at the international level.
       </para>
       <para>
        Part of that Bill included something that we are talking about tonight; namely, a permit scheme within the regulations of the Act to ensure that the scheme was self-financing. The initial maximum figure given to industry for the issuing of such a permit was put at $4,000. In honesty, the Minister has come into the House and brought to our attention the need for an amendment with only one year's activity. Although the Bill shows the fee as being from $4,000 to $8,000, it was also interesting to read in the explanatory notes that $8,000 was a maximum figure.
       </para>
       <para>
        As this is a cost recovery exercise, the Opposition obviously supports it. I would like to say in front of the Minister that I am concerned that this may get out of hand in time-the Minister does not know and we do not know. I congratulate him on having brought the need for change before the House within 12 months.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are many aspects that one could discuss, but this is not the time. I simply congratulate the Minister for bringing this legislation to the House, because it is something we have to keep talking about very seriously in this Parliament. Hazardous waste is not just the NIMBY principle in rural areas in south-east Australia, the real problem is that we are not taking account of the tremendous work being done at the moment by the CSIRO in the disposal of hazardous waste. I would have liked to have thought that somehow, some time, we could be discussing quickly in this Parliament what support the CSIRO has to have.
       </para>
       <para>
        The shadow Minister for privatisation, the honourable member for Bass, Mr Smith, who is at the table, is a former shadow Minister for science and he would fully understand the sense in which I mention this. We need to give more encouragement to the CSIRO in its endeavours. It has made very serious and successful endeavours, but it needs to go further down the line. We should make sure that the CSIRO gets support from the Government so that it can proceed urgently and with no shortage of funds down the line and so that hazardous wastes are properly handled within Australia. It is a fallacy to talk of the largeness of Australia. It is the transportation of hazardous wastes within our large territory that creates a problem, which I know the Minister is aware of. We support what the Government is doing.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have two other small points: firstly, the posting of an officer from the Australian Navy on to the Australian Maritime Museum. Naturally, I support it. I was disappointed to find in the explanatory memorandum that there was no lead given to the Navy as to type of person we want to have. I think we have to be quite strong and say that we need an Australian person from the Navy who has a great sense of maritime history from the aspects already known and recorded and also from those aspects of our Australian maritime history that have not yet been fully investigated or researched.
       </para>
       <para>
        If anyone here has had anything to do with the Navy on Captain Cook's day-and I guess that I have done this every year for 25 years-he will know that there is an immense knowledge of maritime history within the Australian Navy. It is superb. It has a large base from which to pick the appropriate person, and I believe it has to be given the lead to pick a person who has not only a knowledge of maritime history but also a keen passion about it so that he can bring with him not only what has been done but what should be done in future investigations for the history of maritime services.
       </para>
       <para>
        The last point I make relates to the Australian Film, Television and Radio School. I think it is a nonsense to say that it is too cumbersome to contact 1,000 people in convocation and suddenly to have the six other members of the council nominating three members that they choose. My feelings on this matter-they are very strong feelings-are that this can make permanent attitudes within an organisation that should be regularly and constantly challenged within its own membership. I would like the Minister to reconsider. To say that it is too hard to find enough people to vote, and to finish up by saying that only 172 of the 1,000 people could vote, is a nonsense because it meant that 172 people did vote. We are moving into a situation where six people will be choosing the three members with no directions in the explanatory memorandum as to what type of person should be sought. We have the appointment of Governors-General, of which it is compulsory that the director nominates one or is one-students and workers are mentioned-yet here we are giving six people the right to choose who they want. I hope they look at that again.
       </para>
       <para>
        I find it very interesting also, and I do understand it, that we do not debate the Budget on another Bill, even though it is Budget day. I would be very pleased if the Minister could explain to me why, on page 184 of the Commonwealth Public Accounts document, the one document we were given this morning, we find that in 1991 the appropriation for the Australian Film, Television and Radio School was $745,000, of which $745,000 was spent. That is very sneaky and acute accounting in public finance. Here we are on Budget day debating who should be on the council; yet in the only Budget document I have for the appropriations of 1991-92-this may be a disappointment to the advisers in the House-there is no appropriation for this school. I think it would be a fascinating thing if on this day the Minister could inform the House why we are going to all this business. Are we to assume that the Government is no longer supporting this school or is it somewhere in the Budget Papers that we have not been given? Page 184 shows that there is no appropriation for this school, the membership of whose council we are debating tonight.

         —in reply-I begin my summary tonight by thanking the honourable members who have participated in tonight's debate. I think many of the comments made by the respective speakers were very thoughtful. I begin by thanking the shadow Minister for tourism and aviation, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), for his complimentary remarks. As the Federal Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories, I believe that this is an important industry which deserves bipartisanship. Fundamentally, I believe that there is not a great deal of difference in the respective views of the Opposition and the Government when it comes to the promotion of Australian tourism. As far as I am concerned, that will continue to be the case while I am holding this portfolio.

        There was a suggestion in the honourable member's comment-and it was implied in the comments of other speakers-that what the Government was doing tonight with amendments to the principal Act was fairly unique as far as this Government was concerned. I have not had a chance to check the Hansard records, but I think it would be a safe bet to assume that successive governments since Federation have amended principal Acts on the basis that some accidental omissions or drafting errors have occurred through oversights from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. I do not say that with any disrespect to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel.

         —The point that I was making was that all governments have to confront the issue that, where principal Acts are amended and where there are portfolio amendments introduced, there will be oversights from time to time. I will accept the gentle slap on the wrist that was no doubt intended by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) and, to some extent, the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) in their comments tonight. Perhaps that is being a bit unfair to the honourable member for Cook.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I will just mention a couple of other issues that were raised. A number of speakers talked about the issue of age limits. There was a considerable discussion on this issue of arbitrary age limits at the time that the Australian National Maritime Museum Bill was being debated in this place some months ago. At that time I suggested-following comments by the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney)-that the Government was seriously addressing this particular issue. I was referring to remarks that were made by Senator Richardson in the other place that there was an undertaking given by him that the Attorney-General's Department was looking at this very issue.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am pleased to say that that consideration has been advanced and I was able to indicate yesterday to the shadow Minister for arts that the Government will be introducing amendments into the Senate when the Arts, Sport, Environment and Tourism Amendment Bill is debated to correct this issue. As a number of speakers have pointed out, there is a different attitude within the community when it comes to age and the respective contributions that various people may make on statutory boards and authorities. As we all know, some people can be very young at 65 years of age and some people can be very old at 40 years of age. I do not think we should really bother with the question of age--

         —I have gone a little beyond 40 years of age, but I am a fair way off 65. We will worry about that as we get a bit closer. The important point is that all people are looking very seriously at the issue of age discrimination. Within my particular portfolio and right across the broad portfolio of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories there are only six statutory authorities and agencies that have this age limit. There is a degree of inconsistency there that the Government recognises and will correct when this Bill is introduced into the Senate.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I am able to indicate tonight that the comments made both by members of the Opposition and members of the Government have been taken on board by the Government. They have been given serious consideration over a number of months now and they will be corrected when the Bill is debated in the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is another issue that was raised by the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Fadden, in his comments tonight-the issue of the removal of office holders who are charged with criminal offences. I do not want to say a great deal about this because of the particular individual involved. Nonetheless, there is a basic principle that most people in this House would uphold-that is, the principle that we often refer to as British justice: someone is innocent until proven guilty. So someone who is charged with even the gravest offence is not necessarily guilty of any offence, and the fact that charges are pending against an individual does not necessarily mean that that particular office holder will not continue to perform duties satisfactorily. The Government will certainly continue to uphold that particular principle as far as appointments to government agencies and statutory authorities are concerned.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me conclude on the well deserved comments of the honourable member for Fadden about the role of the Australian Tourist Commission. I think every member of this House can be extraordinarily proud of the role which the Australian Tourist Commission is playing in developing this most significant industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        Tourism is Australia's biggest single export industry. It is generating in excess of $6 billion annually. It employs more than 440,000 Australians and, given the capacity of the industry to expand as far as international visitors are concerned to at least double or even greater than the current level of 2.2 million international visitors, the potential for foreign exchange earnings and for job creation is quite significant.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn now to the comments of the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns). The honourable member for Petrie addressed a couple of the issues that were raised by a number of speakers, including the honourable member for Fadden, about the lifting of the various approval limits on some of those statutory authorities. It is true that the $50,000 limit that applies for the Australian Film, Television and Radio School has been unchanged since 1973. I think all honourable members would acknowledge that an increase is certainly overdue. The limit of $100,000 was set in the case of the National Museum of Australia in 1980. The $100,000 limit for the Australia Council was set by the amendment Bill of 1991. The National Maritime Museum limit was set in 1990.
       </para>
       <para>
        Raising those limits to a more realistic figure of $250,000 will, hopefully, prevent similar sorts of amendments coming before the House on a regular basis. I think that is in line with some of the changes that have been advanced in the Commonwealth's management philosophy for a lot of those statutory authorities.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think that most of us would agree with the comments from the honourable member for Pearce. I thought it was a particularly interesting and thoughtful contribution to the debate. I suppose that one could sum up his comments in relation to the very vexed issue of the placement of the toxic waste incinerator as, `As long as it is not in my backyard, thank you very much'. We have heard a great deal of debate in the community about that. That is an issue for some other debate, except to say that the important issue of the disposal of hazardous waste is something that all responsible countries have to face up to.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for La Trobe made a number of comments in relation to the role of the Australia Council. I must take the opportunity to rebut some of those rather ill informed comments in relation to the role of the Australia Council. He suggested that a 10 per cent administrative cost was quite a large cost. I think that any organisation that has a 10 per cent administrative cost structure is operating very efficiently. I have no doubt that that is the case as far as the Australia Council is concerned.
       </para>
       <para>
        I was disappointed to hear, again, the allusions to the role of the Australia Council with respect to some of the grants to the particular organisations mentioned. I point out again, in the context of this debate, that the often criticised art in working life program was developed by the Australia Council in the time of the Fraser Government. Yet, from time to time, we hear these comments from people associated with the Opposition's Waste Watch Committee about the role and functions of various grants. It somehow overlooks the basis on which these grants were first developed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's policy is very clear with respect to the Australia Council-that is, we will continue to fund the Australia Council on the basis that there will be arm's length assessment of grant applications, there will be no Government direction as to where those grants are allocated, and there will be a continuation of the role of the peer assessment system that has been used so successfully since the Australia Council was formed some 17 years ago.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, I particularly appreciated the comments of the honourable member for Cook in relation to the environment. He has a well-known interest in environmental issues. Whenever he speaks on that particular subject most honourable members respect his knowledge and interest in it. That was certainly the case tonight.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me say to the honourable member that his comments on the role of the Royal Australian Navy's representation on the Council of the Australian National Maritime Museum are well judged. The Navy has been represented, at least in a personal capacity, on the Council since its inception as an interim body. The Navy is a very important part of the maritime experience of Australians. As a former Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, let me say that I am very proud indeed of the role which the Navy and the services generally play in this country. The role of the Navy is reflected in one of the six basic themes of the museum's opening exhibition. The Government recently announced the appointment of Admiral David Holthouse to the position. His experience will be very well appreciated. He follows a number of other similarly well qualified people to that particular Council. His predecessor was Admiral Horton.
       </para>
       <para>
        In relation to the Australian Film, Television and Radio School, let me assure the honourable member for Cook that that school has not been suddenly abolished. I do not have the exact figure with me, but that organisation will continue to be funded. I agree with the honourable member's comments that it is a very valuable organisation for the training of people associated with the film, television and radio industry within this country. Perhaps after this debate is concluded we will be able to go through today's Budget Papers. I can personally reassure the honourable member for Cook that the Film, Television and Radio School is well and truly represented and supported by the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conclusion, let me thank the five honourable members who spoke during the debate. I thank the Opposition for its support of the amendments which have been indicated by the Government during this debate. I accept with good grace the gentle slap on the wrist levelled at the Government on some of these particular amendments.

The Chief Executive of the National Capital Planning Authority, appointed under the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988, is such a full time member.

         —This week Michael Wilkinson, a year 12 student from Assumption College in Kilmore, a school in my electorate, is in Canberra to witness the parliamentary process in action. In fact he is in the gallery this evening. As a resident of a small rural town he is experiencing at first hand the pain and hardship which this Government has brought on to hard-working Australians.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        On his behalf I am delivering a speech that he wrote about the concerns he has for Australia's education system and the action he wants this Labor Government to take to address them. Michael believes that the education of our youth must become Australia's No. 1 priority; it must take precedence over all other issues, no matter how pressing they are. Michael believes that it is time the Government accepted responsibility for its failures. He believes it is using rhetoric to deflect public attention away from the real issues at hand. The debate on whether Australia should become a republic is such an example. The fact that this debate should attract more attention than the problems in the education system is distressing.
       </para>
       <para>
        As Michael wrote, the fact still remains that this year more than 10,000 willing, able and qualified students will be turned away from tertiary institutions. According to Michael this is an absolute disgrace, especially when to the Government it was clear years ago that the demand for more tertiary places would grow substantially. Michael is confused that a government which claims to have the mandate on social justice continues to turn a blind eye to this problem. Using bandaid measures will not solve the problem either. Michael said that something must be done to overcome the overcrowding and lack of places that are prevalent in tertiary institutions. The clever country is an ideal which has been heavily promoted by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). However, Michael wants this ideal to be backed up by action.
       </para>
       <para>
        The young are Australia's biggest asset. To deny them their right to advance themselves through education is a national shame. Michael says that the Prime Minister has been trying to encourage thousands of young Australians to be part of his clever country but he has failed to live up to his part of the bargain. While he has been encouraging more people to stay on at school, it has become increasingly difficult to gain entrance to a tertiary institution. Michael finds this personally alarming as he thought that with their commitment to study came the expectation that provision would be made for them to continue past year 12. This expectation has been dashed.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a student, Michael is disappointed. He wants reform and action from the Government. He realises that it will always be difficult for students to gain a place in a tertiary institution and that students must earn their right of entry to an institution. However, he feels that if the number of places in tertiary institutions does not rise proportionately with the year 12 retention rate, then admission to a tertiary institution goes from being difficult to obtain to near impossible.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some official reports state that around 60 per cent more students will fail to gain a tertiary place next year. It appears to Michael and his class mates, as it does to many others, that the bid by the Government to encourage more students to stay at school was politically motivated and designed to achieve an apparent cut in the youth unemployment figures. He finds this particularly disgraceful. However, putting aside whether that move was politically motivated or not, Michael said that the Government must follow up on this and focus on creating employment opportunities for young people-something this Government has failed to do. Secure jobs which form part of a stable career path for young people must be created.
       </para>
       <para>
        Michael has a vision for Australia. He wants it to be prosperous, successful and lucky once again. It is for that reason that Michael says students are staying on at school until year 12. He says that the Prime Minister called on all students to be clever and to stay at school, but unless he gives them access to quality tertiary education, Australia will never become a clever country.

         —It is quite apparent that Michael, like the Government and the Opposition, does not understand the real problems that are besetting this country. Education is only one of the problems and it is only part of the formula. It is absurd to consider education alone; it must be considered in context, together with industry policy and social policy such as immigration. To fail to understand that is to live in the same narrow, blinkered world as both the Government and the Opposition are doing. I have a vision for this country and it is remarkably similar to Michael's.

        I have recently written a paper on immigration and before that one on industry policy. I am now embarking on a paper meshing all these policies together. I will be putting out a paper this week detailing what I see as Australia's great challenge. There have been three great challenges to this country. The first was the First World War, when we saw the manhood of this country devastated. The second was the Depression, when we saw a third of our people out of work. The third was the trauma of the Second World War. The fourth challenge, as with the previous three, will be of an international nature, but it will be fought at home. It will be fought between those in Australia who see Australia as part of an international society and those who are what I term nationalists.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is true that there are only two bases on which decisions are made. They are made out of either the hope of gain or the fear of loss. I put it to the House that the internationalists who have been in the ascendancy in Australia have operated always out of fear of loss. Theirs is the philosophy of fear. They will tell us what Australia must do. They told us we must be a colony of Britain because we could not exist on our own. They told us we must be a colony of the United States when Britain wavered. Now we are told we must be part of Asia. It is a nonsense philosophy that condemns us forever to being a country of the colonial cringe.
       </para>
       <para>
        The internationalists have had the ascendancy because they have had spokesmen in high places. We have seen the papers of Mr Garnaut given great precedence. In his paper Australia and the North-East Asian Ascendancy he sees us as part of north-east Asia. It is preached to us every day by the multicultural industry in this country. I sometimes smile at the help that organised labour has given the multicultural industry in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        It seems to me that we went headlong down the road of deregulating the economy without any regard to the dangers and without any thought of precautions. Headlong down the road we went with deregulation, freeing up the market, at the same time as society in social areas went in the opposite direction. We found ourselves being constricted. We found free speech being constricted in the name of decency or because it was essential or unthinkable not to do it. These impositions were put upon us, and we find ourselves now beset by all sorts of bodies set up by Parliament to oversee the morality of this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        Unless Australia gets back to a notion of its own worth, unless we build a vision of Australia as a country able and prepared to fight for its place in the world, a country that looks upon its culture as being as good as any and worth defending, unless we can imbue this into the Australian people, then I do not think any amount of higher education is going to help us.
       </para>
       <para>
        In closing, the red herring that has been run across our path about Australia becoming a republic is a nonsense notion that is hardly likely to succeed. It requires a majority of people in a majority of States. The sensible people of Tasmania, Western Australia and South Australia are hardly likely to buy that. This policy is being put about by the multicultural industry because it sees the monarchy as one of the last bastions- (Time expired)

         —In the last couple of minutes of the debate I would like to draw attention to the fact that the Gold Coast is home to perhaps the most successful community radio station in Australia, the Gold Coast Christian &amp;Community Broadcasting Association. It is the name I want to draw to the attention of honourable members because the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal recently brought down a report which suggested, amongst other things, that the station should change its name, that having the word `Christian' in its name discouraged the community from participation. Nothing could be further from the truth.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Since the licence was issued to 4CRB some 7 1/2 years ago the station has served the Gold Coast community extraordinarily well. Despite competition from three commercial radio stations on the Gold Coast, ABC FM and all the Brisbane stations, it is the top rating radio station on the Gold Coast amongst audiences over 45. Perhaps the station is too successful. Perhaps there is too much free speech going on here for the Government's liking.
       </para>
       <para>
        I pose three questions on behalf of the station to the Government. Firstly, does the Government intend doing anything to reinstate the value of sponsorship announcements for public broadcasters in this country, considering that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's harsh, restrictive and inconsistent interpretations have made sponsorship announcements almost worthless for public broadcasters? Secondly, is the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal carrying out Government policy when it harasses and publicly humiliates public broadcasters such as 4CRB Gold Coast by forcing them to make public statements of guilt, like schoolboys? Thirdly, why has the Government not seen fit to appoint a representative from the public broadcasting sector to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal?
       </para>
       <para>
        This whole saga of the renewal of 4CRB's licence reflects very badly on both the Broadcasting Tribunal and the member, Mr Bruce Allen, who presented its findings. Mr Allen should be sacked; the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal should be sacked. In spite of this Government's best efforts, fortunately there are many people in the Gold Coast community who see value in this station. The majority of people do not want the name changed.

      <para>
       I am advised by the National Crime Authority as follows.
      </para>
      <para>
       (1) Mr Anderson is a former informant of the Authority.
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) and (b) He received witness protection and assistance from the Authority for the period September 1987 to January 1989; as Mr Anderson is still considered to be at some risk because of his past assistance, the Authority would prefer not to make public the further details sought; the Authority draws attention to sections 59(5), 60(5) and 61(4) of the National Crime Authority Act which prevent it from divulging any matter the public disclosure of which could prejudice the safety of a person.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The question was put to the 32 New South Wales Police officers and the eight Australian Federal Police officers attached to the Authority's Sydney Office in January 1991; each answered in the negative.

      <para>
       (3) Yes;
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) No.  According to the Authority's records, the matter was left on the basis that those urging the Authority at the 5 June 1986 meeting to investigate the disappearance and possible death of Juanita Nielsen were to consider making a written submission to the Authority; there is no indication in the Authority's records that they ever did so;
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Mr Anderson was already an Authority informant as at 5 June 1986.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) and (b) Some of those interviewed subsequently gave evidence in the proceedings against Saffron in the Local Court in Sydney between 29 September 1986 and 10 October 1986, and the District Court in Sydney between 26 August 1987 and 23 October 1987; the Honourable Member may wish to consult the court transcripts; the Authority is unwilling to identify those who were interviewed but did not give evidence.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) The Authority enquiries were not directed to that matter.

      <para>
       (1) Section 37 of the Wool Marketing Act 1987 gives the Corporation the power to set terms and conditions of employment of staff. Pursuant to this section the Corporation would have the authority to make a concessional loan to a member of staff.
      </para>
      <para>
       The remuneration of the Directors of the Corporation is determined by the Remuneration Tribunal and consequently there is no authority for loans to be made available to Directors.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) and (3) The only loans made by the Corporation to staff relate to yearly rail tickets.  The Corporation advances the cost of a yearly rail ticket to staff, and recovers such costs from staff salaries on a fortnightly basis. There are some 18 staff involved in this scheme with the advances outstanding being less than $13,000. None of these staff owns sheep properties in New Zealand.

      <para>
       (1) Yes, I am aware of the reports, however advice received from the Department of Health of Papua New Guinea (PNG) indicates that as of 31 March 1991, there had been a cumulative total of 74 laboratory-confirmed cases of HIV infection, and of these, 33 had progressed to AIDS and 21 had died. However, the Department has pointed out that, due to under-diagnosis and under-reporting of HIV and AIDS cases, these official figures represent only a proportion of those infected.
      </para>
      <para>
       Using World Health Organization (WHO) methods of extrapolation, the PNG Health Department has estimated that the actual number of AIDS cases is in the range from 40 to 500, and the actual number of HIV-infected persons is between 400 and 5000.  The uncertainty in these figures would prevent the accurate estimation of the number of HIV infections expected by October 1991.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Australia regards international co-operation as being of the utmost importance in combating AIDS. Papua New Guinea is assisted both directly and through a range of practical regional and multi-country programs in the South Pacific.
      </para>
      <para>
       Australia's major direct HIV/AIDS-related assistance to PNG has been through:
      </para>
      <para>
       A grant in 1988-89 of $109,000 for the provision of HIV test kits to the Red Cross for screening of the blood supply in PNG.
      </para>
      <para>
       Representatives from PNG were funded to attend the Conference on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific in Canberra (1990) and the Meeting of Health Officials to discuss the Control of the STDs and HIV in Northern Australia in February 1991.
      </para>
      <para>
       In March 1990 the Government of PNG, in collaboration with the WHO, organised a meeting for Participating Parties in Support of the PNG National Medium-term Programme for the Prevention and Control of AIDS. The meeting was attended by representatives from Australia and other countries which donate to PNG's AIDS program, and from 15 United Nations agencies, intergovernmental organisations, non-government organisations, multilateral and bilateral agencies.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Medium-term Programme was fully endorsed by the Participating Parties and the outcome of the meeting assured a firm financial foundation for the implementation of the activities planned for the first year.
      </para>
      <para>
       Papua New Guinea has also received assistance indirectly, through the following activities in the South Pacific:
      </para>
      <para>
       $800,000 over three years for the South Pacific Commission's Regional AIDS Prevention and Education Project. The project includes information dissemination and practical hands-on training in technical aspects of AIDS education for health and community workers, and targeted distribution of AIDS related materials specifically produced for Pacific Islanders.
      </para>
      <para>
       $145,000 for one year to WHO for AIDS prevention activities in the South Pacific within the ambit of the Global Program on AIDS. This includes supporting governments of Pacific island countries to prepare national medium-term plans for the Prevention of AIDS.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Equity interests held by banks inevitably carry some seeds of conflict of interest. That is one reason for the Reserve Bank's policy that banks' equity investments should normally be in the field of financial intermediation and that interests in non-financial businesses should not be substantial.
      </para>
      <para>
       That said, the Reserve Bank recognises that in `working out' problem loans it may sometimes be in the best interests of both the bank and borrower if, for a time, the bank takes an equity interest in the borrower.
      </para>
      <para>
       Conflicts can equally arise, of course, as a result of many other financial or fiduciary associations which develop in the ordinary course of a bank's business. The Reserve Bank seeks to take this potential into consideration when developing prudential guidelines.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Apart from the Reserve Bank, other regulatory bodies such as the Australian Securities Commission and the Trade Practices Commission also have an interest in competition and conflicts of interest in general and in company liquidations and receiverships in particular.

       (1) Australian asthma mortality rates up to 1989 from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that:
      </para>
      <para>
       For ages 0 to 9 the number of deaths is so small that it is insufficient to determine any trend.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the 10 to 19 age group the figures do not show an upward trend, in fact the rates for 1987 to 1989 show a fall from the 1984 to 1986 rates.
      </para>
      <para>
       The asthma mortality rate has increased overall in Australia but this is a result mainly of the larger number of deaths in the older population (particularly 60 years and over).
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) No.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) A number of overseas studies have indicated that asthma is underdiagnosed and hence undertreated. This does lead to significant morbidity but does not appear to be a major factor responsible for death in young people.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, underestimation of the severity of asthma by the patient, their family and their doctor is an important contribution to a high risk of death from asthma.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Asthma aerosol inhalers predominantly use CFC-11 and CFC-12 as their propellants. Alternative propellants tested to date have not proved successful in providing satisfactory aerosol dispersion to the lung alveoli. Trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11) and CFC-12 have an extensive toxicological human exposure literature indicating an absence of observable clinical effects to concentrations much higher and for more extended periods than would be anticipated from asthma inhaler usage. The Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories obtains expert advice to enable proper consideration of the issues in the granting of exemptions under section 40 of the Ozone Protection Act 1989.

       (6) As the Commonwealth Ozone Protection Act 1989 controls only manufacture, import and export of ozone depleting substances and manufacture and import of scheduled products, controls relating to sales of these products are the responsibility of each State. The Commonwealth Ozone Protection Act 1989 would come into play only where a product had been illegally manufactured or imported in relation to that Act.

      <para>
       (7) (a) and (b) The duty of a medical practitioner towards a patient is regulated by the Common Law. The actual contents of the duty and how that duty is met varies from case to case. The underlying legal concept behind all medical treatment is the doctrine of `informed consent'. The Discussion Paper No. 7 of Law Reform Commission of Victoria titled `Informed Consent to Medical Treatment' provides good examples of the problems in determining exactly what information a medical practitioner must provide to the patient. The Consumers' Health Forum has also published a document entitled `Legal Recognition and Protection of the Rights of Health Consumers' which outlines concerns with the level of information provided to patients. Accordingly, it is not possible to state with any certainty exactly what information a treating medical practitioner is legally required to provide to a particular patient concerning the use of aerosol inhalers.

The Return for 1989-90 was tabled in August 1990 and the Return for 1990-91 is expected to be tabled in August 1991. Since there are over 100 recipients of the Metal Working Machines and Robots Bounty in each year, it is not feasible to list the focus of commercial activity of each one in this response. However, the majority of bounty recipients are principally engaged in the production of eligible equipment and/or components.
      </para>

       (4) An evaluation of the effectiveness of the Metal Working Machines and Robots Bounty was conducted by the Bureau of Industry Economics in 1989-90. Its findings are contained in the BIE Program Evaluation Report No 9, which concluded that the scheme had been largely effective in meeting its objectives. This report is publicly available and a copy can be supplied by my Department on request.

       <para in-line="1">
        —-The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce has provided the following answers to the honourable member's questions:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The proposals included in the Information Technology Strategy in the Ministerial Statement of 12 March have been allocated $2.0 million per year for three years, from 1991-2.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) In accordance with the IT purchasing principles announced in the Minister's Statement of 22 March 1991, heads of agencies are fully accountable for the implementation of the Government's purchasing policies.  Agency heads are also responsible for compliance with purchasing policy (including outsourcing), with advice from Acquisition Councils (where the project is expected to cost more than $5 million), and reporting to Parliament, through their annual reports.
      </para>
      <para>
       Guidelines for the outsourcing of IT services are currently being drafted by the Information Exchange Steering Committee (IESC) in consultation with Government agencies and other interested parties.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) No formal study of the impact of the policy of contracting out has been undertaken.
      </para>
      <para>
       Contracting out of IT functions is an emerging trend in public and private sector procurement.  The world market for this service is estimated to grow to some $US32 billion by 1994.  Commentators anticipate that by 1995 around half of the major businesses in the US will be contracting out the provision of IT services.  This trend will quickly spread throughout the world, with particular opportunities in Asia.
      </para>
      <para>
       Commonwealth agencies already outsourcing include the Department of Veterans Affairs, CSIRO, the Department of Defence, and the Australian Center for Remote Sensing.  In the private sector companies outsourcing in Australia include AMP, BHP and BTR.
      </para>
      <para>
       Due to the large number of ways in which contracting out can be implemented and the range of issues which need to be considered, such as security and privacy, the extent of contracting out will depend on the concerns and requirements of the organisation.  It is common, for example, to retain applications development and control the strategic direction while successfully contracting out the operation of the processing area.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are a number of Australian IT service companies successfully competing for business overseas.  By providing the opportunity for additional work in Australia these companies, provided they are competitive with other suppliers, could grow stronger and broaden their capabilities.
      </para>
      <para>
       The adoption of outsourcing will also allow agencies to focus on the delivery of government services rather than the management of technology.
      </para>
      <para>
       If, in any specific case, the evidence from testing the market is that an outsourcing solution is not compatible with considerations of cost and agency efficiency then the contracting out solution will not be pursued.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Government Departments and Agencies are required to test the market for outsourcing with a view to maximising outsourcing subject to value for money and other public policy considerations.
      </para>
      <para>
       The requirement to test the market for outsourcing are subject to cost effectiveness, agency efficiency and public policy considerations.  Exemptions to the requirement on agencies to test the market are subject to approval by the respective agency head and advice from the Acquisition Council.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) Departments and Agencies are required to test the market with a view to maximising outsourcing of IT services consistent with cost effectiveness and agency efficiency.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) All IT services may be contracted out.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) No, outsourcing is a form of contracting out.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) Contracting out is a common procedure in the general purchasing practices of government agencies.
      </para>
      <para>
       (9) The Government is currently developing the criteria for membership to the Panel.  The criteria for membership to the Panel is likely to include:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) expertise as a system integrator/service vendor;
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) commitment to integrate products other than their own;
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) commitment to open systems and use of GOSIP;
      </para>
      <para>
       (d) commitment to industry development in Australia, including
      </para>
      <para>
       (i)  performance of any Partnerships or offsets commitments by transnational applicants
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii)  R&amp; performance
      </para>
      <para>
       (iii)  export performance, particularly service exports
      </para>
      <para>
       (iv)  strategic links with local suppliers; and
      </para>
      <para>
       (e) the long term viability of the applicant and its strategic direction.
      </para>
      <para>
       (10) Multinationals companies wishing to supply services through the Panel will, in addition, be required to meet all Government policies including the requirements of the Offsets and the Partnership for Development programs.
      </para>
      <para>
       (11) Discussions have been held with a number of local and overseas companies in the lead up to the proposals announced in the Industry Statement.
      </para>
      <para>
       (12) No. However, each Department is required to produce an Information Technology Strategic Plan on a regular basis.  This plan contains broad details about their proposed information technology activities.
      </para>
      <para>
       In addition, Departments produce annual Information Technology Forward Procurement Plans which provide a 3-year forward estimate of information technology expenditure.  Departments are required to distribute these plans to the Department of Administrative Services; Finance; Industry, Technology and Commerce; Attorney-General; and the Joint House Department of the Parliament.
      </para>
      <para>
       (13) Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (14) No. Departments and agencies must now consider the cost effectiveness of contracting out their IT needs as an alternative to the maintenance of in-house capabilities.  In looking at the options for contracting out, Departments and agencies will first examine whether their requirements should be met within the public sector, but once a decision is taken to go beyond the public sector, Government agencies, other than Government Business Enterprises and the Department of Administrative Services (DAS), will be excluded from tendering.
      </para>
      <para>
       (15) (a) DAS has a charter to provide a wide range of services, including information technology services, to clients in the Government Departments and Agencies. The services are provided within the framework of `value for money'. In a number of cases DAS provides information technology services to Departments and agencies because the services cannot be provided by the private sector.  However, in most situations the DAS role is one of adding value to the service and fostering the information technology industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) There has been a progressive introduction of open competition based on full cost recovery and accrual accounting practices. The Government decided on this approach in 1988 following a major review of common services, and already savings in excess of $150m per annum have been achieved across DAS, with more in prospect.
      </para>
      <para>
       (16) Yes:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) The Partnerships for Development program will be broadened to provide recognition for activities which are consistent with the Government's objectives in information technology policy but which are not currently recognised.
      </para>
      <para>
       The type of activities which might be considered for recognition under the changes to the Program include:
      </para>
      <para>
       initiatives in strategic infrastructure development (eg electronic components) which are also expected to generate export activity and are identified as essential within the Information Industries Strategy;
      </para>
      <para>
       initiatives which focus on the development of third party (indigenous) industry capability of world standard in important industry sectors; and
      </para>
      <para>
       investment in approved venture capital funds where the funds are to be invested in manufacturing capability.
      </para>
      <para>
       All multinational firms with annual Government sector sales over $40 million will be expected to join the Partnerships Program.
      </para>
      <para>
       Firms with annual Government sector sales of between $10 million and $40 million will be expected to enter Fixed Term Arrangements with the Commonwealth Government.  These agreements will combine elements of the Pre-Qualified Offsets Supplier (PQOS) and Partnerships programs.
      </para>
      <para>
       Firms with annual sales to Government of less than $10 million will no longer be required to undertake industry development activity.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The Government is making some evolutionary changes to the administrative arrangements for the Partnerships for Development and offsets programs and expanding the range of eligible activities under Partnerships.
      </para>
      <para>
       The broad principles under which the Partnerships program operates have been preserved.  Firms will be required to develop over seven years, a program of activity which equates with the original requirements of R&amp; investment of 5% of turnover annually and exports (with 70% local content) equivalent to 50% of imports annually.
      </para>
      <para>
       Current Partners will be invited to reconsider their commitments in the light of these changes to the administrative arrangements. PQOS firms with sales below the $40 million threshold are free to enter the Program if they choose. At the conclusion of their agreement, Partners will be expected to at least maintain their levels of R&amp; and export activity, but will incur no additional industry development obligations.

      <para>
       (5, 6) Neither the current Deputy Chair nor the incoming Chair sought appointment to the position. To disclose the names of persons seeking appointment and considered for the position without overriding and demonstrated public interest in such disclosure would be an inappropriate breach of the privacy conventions that apply in such selection processes.

       (7) The selection of a Chair for a Council of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training (NBEET) is made by the Governor-General in Council on my recommendation as the Minister for Employment, Education and Training.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) Mr Carmichael has made a substantial contribution over many years to the national debate over workplace reform and reform of Australia's employment, education and training practices and policies. Mr Carmichael was a member of the Australian Manufacturing Council from 1984 to 1990, and Deputy Chair 1987-1990; a member of the National Industry Extension Service Advisory Council, 1986-1990; member of the Trade Development Council, 1985-1988; currently he is a member of the Prime Minister's Science Council; member of the board of CSIRO; member of the National Project on the Quality of Teaching and Learning; member of the Australian Education Council Review of Young People's Participation in Post-compulsory Education and Training; and a member of the Vocational Education, Employment and Training Advisory Committee. He was a member of the overseas mission which produced `Australia Reconstructed' in 1986; represented the Australian Council of Trade Unions at the International Labour Organisation Conference on education relating to under-developed countries in Sweden in 1985 and participated in four Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development conferences on work organisation, skill formation, education and training.
      </para>
      <para>
       His deep knowledge of the trade union movement has been valuable to the work of the Employment and Skills Formation Council and the National Board itself, on both of which bodies he has served since 1988. There is a requirement under the Employment, Education and Training Act, 1988 for the appointment to the Board of NBEET of two persons having expertise or experience in matters relating to trade unions. Mr Carmichael has filled one of those positions since 1988 and will continue to do so in his new capacity as Council Chair from 1 October 1991.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The sale process for both airlines will comprise an initial `trade sale' followed by a public float to sell any remaining equity, if necessary.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government has no fixed view on the proportion of available equity to be sold in the `trade sale' process. However, I wish to remind the House of the Government's objectives to sell 100 per cent of the issued capital of Australian Airlines and 49 per cent of the issued capital of Qantas.
      </para>
      <para>
       As a consequence, the Government will entertain approaches from potential purchasers, including consortia, interested in the possibility of acquiring all of the equity available in each airline.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government has expressed a desire that some of the equity in each airline could be offered to the public at an appropriate time.
      </para>
      <para>
       Consequently, the Task Force on Asset Sales and its advisers are undertaking, concurrently with the `trade sale' process, the preparations necessary for an initial public offering for each airline in due course.
      </para>
      <para>
       A decision on the proportion of equity to be sold by way of a public float will depend, in part, on the likely effect on sale proceeds, as assessed during negotiations with potential purchasers during the `trade sale' process.
      </para>
      <para>
       A subsequent sell-down of equity via public floats by the successful trade sale purchaser(s) of Australian Airlines and Qantas could be acceptable to the Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Foreign investment in Qantas and Australian Airlines is subject to the general provisions of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975, plus specific decisions of the Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act requires the Government to be notified of proposals by foreign interests to acquire shares in Australian businesses beyond certain `trigger' thresholds. These thresholds are 15 per cent of the issued shares in a corporation by a single foreign interest or 40 per cent of the issued shares in a corporation by two or more foreign interests.
      </para>
      <para>
       Proposals by foreign interests to acquire existing businesses or to establish new businesses in Australia are normally approved - subject to their meeting, where relevant, the Government's specific equity limits and not raising issues considered to be contrary to the national interest.
      </para>

        —-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The efficiency dividend is the mechanism the Government uses to ensure that a proportion of productivity improvements achieved in the public sector are realised and made available for the Government to allocate according to its priorities. In announcing the efficiency dividend arrangements in September 1986, the Prime Minister emphasised the capacity and the obligation of the public service to generate efficiency gains.
      </para>
      <para>
       The public sector is not immune from the requirement to increase productivity and thereby increase living standards. Productivity gains in the public sector are achieved by improved management and administrative practices, environmental changes, investment in technology and the better utilisation of human resources.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The efficiency dividend is applied to the total running costs of departments and agencies (including funds obtained under s35 of the Audit Act). The running costs base to which the efficiency dividend is applied is broadly consistent across departments and agencies ensuring the efficiency dividend is applied as equitably as possible.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The efficiency dividend was first applied in the 1987-88 Budget as part of a package of running costs reforms giving agencies greater flexibility in the use of funds.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The efficiency dividend is set at the rate of 1.25 per cent of running costs per annum. It has been applied at this rate for the period 1987-88 to 1990-91 inclusive and will continue at this rate throughout the forward estimates period (i.e. until, and including, 1993-94). The efficiency dividend is subject to review in 1993-94.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) (a) The efficiency dividend is applied to the defined running costs base which is broadly consistent across departments and agencies. Some agencies receive their funding for running costs through a `one-line' appropriation, in these instances it is necessary to exempt non-running costs payments in defining the running cost base. Running costs are defined as:
      </para>
      <para>
       salaries;
      </para>
      <para>
       administrative/operational payments; and
      </para>
      <para>
       other full current costs of providing the services for which an agency is responsible (including minor capital less than $250,000).
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Running costs do not include:
      </para>
      <para>
       capital payments (over $250,000);
      </para>
      <para>
       transfer payments (e.g. grants, subsidies, personal benefit payments); or
      </para>
      <para>
       loans.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) The Government considers there is broad scope for departments and agencies to realise productivity gains and efficiencies from running costs and thus service the efficiency dividend. The Government does not believe that the efficiency dividend is applied in circumstances where there is little apparent capacity to improve efficiency. Scope exists for the dividend to be paid for in part or full with genuine discretionary program savings.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) Indefinite application of the efficiency dividend would over time, (other things being equal) reduce an organisation's real level of running costs funding but will have no effect on its ability to meet the Government's objectives provided genuine efficiencies are realised.

       Caution should be exercised in making comparisons between the pre-Medicare period and the Medicare period (Medicare commenced on 1 February 1984) due to the different coverage of the schemes in the respective periods. For example, in the period from 1 September 1981 to 1 February 1984, the uninsured, who were not classified as persons in special need or pensioners entitled to Pension Health Benefits cards, received no Commonwealth medical benefits. The trend would also be affected by the rate of adoption of these new forms of imaging (CAT and ultrasound).
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The controls which apply to the use of CAT and ultrasound scanning are those which apply to the provision of diagnostic imaging services generally. Since 1 May 1991, the Health Insurance Act has required that, for the purposes of paying Medicare benefits, generally diagnostic imaging services must be requested in writing by another practitioner who has no financial interest in the provision of those services. To further enforce an `arm's length' referral arrangement in the provision of diagnostic imaging services, the Act provides that certain activities, which had the effect of encouraging the rendering of imaging services, are deemed to be prohibited practices.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the case of unreferred ultrasound, the payment of Medicare benefits is restricted to two examinations in any one pregnancy.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) As is evident from the above table, benefits expenditure on CAT and ultrasound scanning has been increasing. The Government is conscious that there have been significantly greater increases in the utilisation of private diagnostic services, including pathology, than in other medical services. In the context of the National Health Strategy, the Government will be considering what action can be taken to ensure that diagnostic services are used appropriately.
      </para>
      <para>
       Some of the increase may be due to shifts from the public to the private sector, though it is not possible to quantify to what extent, if any, this has occurred.

       Six of the thirteen members of the Council for the Order of Australia in 1975 were public servants. The number of public servants appointed to the Council at any time is largely a reflection of the nominations of the Australian State/Territory Governments. The 1975 Constitution of the Order of Australia and the present Constitution (as amended in 1989) specify only one position which must be filled by a public servant.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The view was put to the Council in 1975 that recognition of public servants should be reserved for public servants who had rendered particularly distinguished and meritorious service. In subsequent lists the Council proceeded to make recommendations for public servants where merited.

       (1) Did Dr Streeton, adviser to the Victorian Health Department, indicate in 1986 that of the 246 cases of tuberculosis (TB) in Victoria, 60 per cent were migrants and most had not been effectively screened before entering Australia.
      </para>

       (3) Were 73 per cent of the 238 cases of TB reported in Victoria in 1989 migrants.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Did Dr Streeton, co-author of a National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) report on TB, indicate in 1990 that unless effective screening measures were implemented, TB, a disease which at great effort and expense over many years had been virtually eradicated from Australia, would be spread throughout the community.

       (5) Did Professor Boughton, a leading figure in the development of the hepatitis vaccine, claim in 1988 that approximately 10 per cent of Asian migrants who came to Australia each year carried the hepatitis B virus.

      <para>
       (6) Did the NHMRC report in 1987 that large numbers of migrants with cases of leprosy and TB had passed through Commonwealth medical screening tests without their condition being recognised.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) Are the strictest possible health checks being carried out on migrants before they enter the Australian community; if not, are health checks inadequate because of (i) fears of being called racist and (ii) appeasement of the multicultural lobby and (b) will he explain the inadequacy to the Australian public and why their health has been put at risk.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) - (3)  Data from the Victorian Department of Health indicate that 61.4 per cent of all reported cases of tuberculosis (TB) in that State in 1986 and 73 per cent of cases in 1989, were from individuals who were born outside Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       204 cases of the 290 reported cases of TB in NSW in 1986 were individuals born outside Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       The official statistics do not reveal whether the persons concerned were recent migrants or visitors to Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) No.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) The NHMRC in its Report of the 104th session (Canberra, November 1987) noted concerns about the adequacy of health screening of migrants in the country of origin as immigrants.  The Council recommended that migrants from high risk areas be screened for hepatitis B, leprosy, TB and syphilis prior to acceptance as an immigrant.  It also recommended evaluation after arrival in Australia to validate screening procedures and to provide treatment where necessary.  No actual numbers were given in the Report of the cases of TB or leprosy that had been admitted into Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) The health screening process conducted on each and every potential temporary or permanent migrant to Australia consists of a comprehensive medical examination and a chest X-ray, with further investigation where indicated.  The process is oversighted and cleared by the Migrant Medical Clearance section of the Department of Community Services and Health in Sydney, with assistance from two Australian doctors, one based in Paris and the other in Bangkok.
      </para>
      <para>
       Persons with active TB are not permitted to enter Australia until treatment has been completed in their country of origin.  All persons with a past history of TB are followed up upon arrival by State health authorities to ensure no inadvertent spread of the disease.  Such persons are required to sign a TB undertaking prior to embarkation to facilitate compliance with this procedure.
      </para>
      <para>
       The pre-arrival health screen cannot account for all persons who may contract TB or other illness during the time span between the health screen and migration.  To overcome this problem, the Health Ministers' Council has asked the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs to provide lists of all new migrants to the relevant State health authorities, so that migrants from countries where TB is endemic may be followed up.

        —-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Charges for post office boxes are set on a commercial basis taking into account the costs of providing that service and its commercial value.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 Australia Post is required to perform its functions in a manner consistent with sound commercial practice.  Up until this Act came into force, private box charges in many cases did not provide an adequate return on investment costs.
      </para>
      <para>
       Prior to 1990 the charges for private boxes increased at a rate considerably less than the Consumer Price Index (CPI).  From 1980 to 1989, private box charges increased by 36 per cent whilst CPI has increased by 104 per cent.
      </para>
      <para>
       In order to provide the private box service on a more commercial basis, Australia Post increased charges by an average of 22.5 per cent from 29 January 1990 and by an average of 15.9 per cent from 28 January 1991.  These increases mean that private box charges better reflect the commercial value of this service.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Australia Post's private post office box charges are reviewed annually and any changes in the rates charged are implemented on a national basis. However, the General Manager of each State administration has the delegation to vary charges at particular post offices within the overall national charging structure.
      </para>
      <para>
       A post office which has higher property costs may fall into a charging category which attracts higher private box charges.  To the extent that charges therefore better reflect the commercial costs of providing the private box service, this is a commercially sensible arrangement.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The consumer price index is one of a number of factors considered when setting charges for private post office boxes.  The charges are not, however, set in accordance with the movement of any particular index but in line with the commercial judgement of Australia Post as required by its legislation.
      </para>
      <para>
       When setting these charges, Australia Post also takes into account its legislative obligation to make postal services reasonably accessible to all people in Australia.  As a consequence, the charge for boxholders who would otherwise receive less than a twice weekly mail delivery service is considerably cheaper than for other private box holders; that is, $6 per year as against $35 for a small private box.

      <para>
       (6) The ASTEC report `Funding the Fabric: Should Commonwealth Government Competitive Research Granting Schemes Contribute More to Research Infrastructure Costs?' examined the infrastructure implications for research grants to higher education institutions provided by Commonwealth agencies. It found that the current arrangements for financing research in the higher education sector through a mix of operating funds and competitive grants were generally appropriate. The implications for non-Commonwealth external funding of research and contract research would be a matter for negotiation between the institutions themselves and the organisations providing the research funding.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) and (8)  At the present time, a detailed inventory of higher education facilities does not exist. The Department of Employment, Education and Training is developing a Space Planning and Management System (SPAM) which, inter alia, will provide information on the amount, type and quality of space within the higher education system.
      </para>
      <para>
       The inventory data has been sought by 30 June 1991. This information will provide a basis for determining the rehabilitation needs for the system as a whole and will be useful in assessing the relative capital needs of institutions when determining the higher education capital program in future years.
      </para>
      <para>
       (9) The Higher Education Capital Program is funded on a rolling triennium basis. Each year, as part of the educational profiles process, higher education institutions are invited to make submissions to the Department of Employment, Education and Training listing their highest priority projects for possible inclusion in the capital program for the next triennium. These submissions include a justification statement and cost, area and student capacity estimates for each project and are discussed with institutions as part of the profiles process. The final decisions on institutional allocations are made in accordance with Commonwealth, State and institutional priorities.

       (3) Allocations of ASF funds are made to sporting bodies, the majority of which are national sporting organisations. The disbursement of these funds by national sporting organisations in many cases will be through their State and Territory affiliates, but the ASC is not privy to this information. State and local sporting organisations are, however, the recipients of some preferred donations to the ASF. The following table categorises allocations made by the Foundation in the eleven months to 31 May 1991 as listed in the table above on the basis of whether they are a national body or solely located within a particular State or Territory:

       (a) The following countries have taken no decisions to grant or resume direct bilateral aid to Vietnam: Australia, Belgium, Canada, the Netherlands, UK and USA.
      </para>
      <para>
       Denmark has agreed to provide US$10 million in bilateral aid to Vietnam in 1991-92 for spare parts and training related to five of the projects funded by Denmark prior to the suspension of its aid program. The resumption of a full bilateral aid program beyond this contribution has not been decided.
      </para>
      <para>
       France signed an agreement on economic, industrial, cultural, scientific and technical cooperation with Vietnam in June 1989. In 1990 France provided bilateral grant aid amounting to 45 million francs for priority sectors of telecommunications, health and agricultural infrastructure, 40 million francs covering cultural, scientific and technical assistance, and 10 million francs for food aid. However, France does not intend to negotiate a full resumption of bilateral aid, including long term concessional loans, until Vietnam meets its financial obligations on its international borrowings.
      </para>
      <para>
       Germany, in the period following unification, has committed DM 7 million in bilateral grant aid for two substantive programs: one for economic reform through reform of vocational training systems set in place by the German Democratic Republic, and the other for the establishment of projects for the protection of rainforest areas.
      </para>
      <para>
       Italy and Vietnam agreed in May 1990 on a bilateral aid program of US$110 million over three years, comprising about US$28 million in grants and the remainder in soft loans, in areas such as water supply, fisheries, telecommunications, health/pharmaceutical and sericulture. In March 1991 the total of the program was increased to US$140 million, with grant aid comprising about a quarter of the total package. It is expected that disbursement of the soft loan component of the program may be subject to some delays, depending on Vietnam's progress in payment of outstanding debts.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) With regard to the situation of lending to Vietnam by multilateral development banks, the position described in my answer to Question 164 remains unchanged. The International Monetary Fund, International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, International Development Association, Asian Development Bank and Asian Development Fund have taken no decisions to grant or resume loans to Vietnam.

       Participation in the 12th meeting of the Intergovernmental Council of the International Program for Development of Communications (IPDC) held in Paris on 11-18 February 1991 was through representation from the Australian Embassy in Paris. Australia attaches particular importance to the activities of the IPDC, especially in communications training. A grant through the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau of $500,000 was made to IPDC in 1989 for a three year Pacific video training program, Pacvideo. Given current priorities and funding and personnel constraints Australia did not participate in the 1st Extraordinary Session of the Intergovernmental Committee for the World Decade for Cultural Development (Paris, 4-8 February 1991).

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) My attention has not been drawn specifically to the information being distributed by the Constitutional Heritage Protection Society and Orion Publications. Such speculation concerning the origins of the AIDS virus is, however, not new, and has been published previously in Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) No.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The AIDS virus has not been artificially cloned, as contended in the information disseminated by these organisations. There is a large amount of scientific evidence that indicates that HIV, the AIDS virus, is derived from similar viruses which infect primate populations in Central Africa. HIV has been shown to have similar structure and biology to these viruses. It does not share these features with the viruses from which it has been claimed the AIDS virus has been constructed.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) No.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The likely origin of the AIDS virus has been the subject of much scientific research and discussion. In a review recently published in the prestigious scientific journal `Nature' (Vol 348, p578, 1990), it was explained that the virus is probably derived from similar viruses which have been recently found to be infecting African chimpanzees. It is likely that this virus has been transmitted to the people of Central Africa over a long period of time, for example when hunters of the chimpanzees contaminated cuts on their skin with infected chimpanzee blood, or when monkey blood was used in sexual practices by some of the Central African peoples.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the middle of this century, conditions occurred which would have enabled the virus to spread from these endemic central African regions. Communication with the peoples of these regions improved, and there was extensive migration to urban areas. At the same time, the use of needles and syringes for vaccinations and antibiotic inoculations became more common in Africa. These factors probably enabled the virus to become more prevalent in urban areas where there is more contact with people from the West. The virus then spread to Western populations, at first causing sporadic unrecognised AIDS cases. By the early 1980s the virus was causing outbreaks of disease in specific groups such as homosexual men, and this led to its isolation and identification.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) No.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) There are other organisations which are active in promoting distinctive interpretations of the origins and the political and social impact of the AIDS virus, but I do not have details as to their nature, membership, funding or professed social and political functions. Individuals and organisations are free to promote these alternative interpretations if they desire. The Government's role in this area is to ensure that the public is provided with scientifically supported information on HIV and AIDS. The Australian National Council on AIDS has provided bulletins containing such up-to-date factual information and the Government has run national education campaigns, providing a wide variety of AIDS information to the general community and to specific groups within the community.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       This question has been taken to refer to common law damages claims (as distinct from claims for compensation under statutory compensation schemes). The following answer has been prepared on that basis.
      </para>
      <para>
       (1) (a) Approximately 60 claims by dependants of Navy personnel who died and 3 claims by survivors. In addition, one claim by dependants of a civilian was determined by the High Court and approximately 230 claims for loss of personal property belonging to Voyager crew members were settled.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Nil.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) 2 claims by survivors.  In addition, one claim by a survivor was determined by the Victorian Supreme Court.
      </para>
      <para>
       (d) 3 claims by survivors.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) I consider that it would be unreasonable to publish the names of the persons concerned.  With regard to the amounts of settlements, I am advised that it is not normal practice to disclose publicly the amounts of settlements arrived at between the parties to such common law claims, and a stipulation that the terms not be disclosed is often a condition of settlements.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) I am advised that there are 80 outstanding actions by survivors.  I am also advised that the applicability of the Verwayen decision to any of the pending cases is unresolved.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The Commonwealth is not in a position to say when the matters will be finalised.

Responsibility for the records of these offices became the responsibility of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce from 6 January 1986 with the formation of the Australian Trade Commission. The question relating to the opening and closing of trade offices during the period since 1983 should be directed to my colleague, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce.

       (1) Yes. The James Harrison Bridge was jointly funded by the Federal and Victorian Governments and the break up of funding is as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       State Government--$4.78 million
      </para>

      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The barrier kerbing was constructed using a new form of slip forming machine. This was done to reduce construction time from 16 weeks for traditional hand methods to 3-4 weeks using the machine. Expected time savings were achieved, but quality of finish was not. The correction of shape of the kerb was required to achieve a quality of workmanship comparable to other similar works throughout Victoria.
      </para>

       (c) The cost of maintenance work is $150,000.

       (3) Vic Roads has advised that the cost of the work is still the subject of discussions with the bridge contractor, Lewis Construction Company, together with other outstanding matters on this contract.

       (ii) The publication includes an article written by the Unemployed Workers Union, Melbourne, describing  Newstart  and  Jobsearch. The Unemployed Workers Union (not Student Initiatives in Community Health) appears to have some concerns about Newstart and provides its own address as a contact.

       (iii) My Department does not have editorial control over the contents of the publication nor is it appropriate that it should.
