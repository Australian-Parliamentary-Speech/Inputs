                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:31</span>):  Just to summarise my contribution yesterday, before debate was interrupted, it's taken 16 years to get a process in place and a legislative outcome in parliament to provide director-identifying numbers in this country on our business register. At the same time we're going to get a modernisation of our business register and a reform that sees the ownership of this register and the management of this register transferred from ASIC to the Australian tax office. It's taken 16 years of talking to get something as simple and important as a verification process, an authenticity process, in place that provides transparency in corporate Australia as to who is actually the director of a company so that we can have faith and confidence that those directors are genuine.</span>

This is something that the Greens have been campaigning for for some time, as well as a number of stakeholders around the country who want to see tax justice, who want to see the rorts cracked down on. I'll just read for senators a very brief comment from Michael West, who does fantastic work on exposing some of the rorts that we have in our tax system, the companies that often get away without paying tax and, more importantly, the solutions to help fix these issues. Michael says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">What is the point of a beneficial ownership register?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For those who have not had the pleasure of acquaintance with a beneficial ownership register, the point of a beneficial ownership register is that if people are required to disclose what they own, the things they own will be taxed more effectively.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Pretty simple, really—rather than thinking, it seems:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Better to hide them, make up silly names and concoct tortuous transnational structures which nobody can decipher. Better to stuff money into tax havens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To put it another way, the point of not having a beneficial ownership register is therefore to facilitate tax evasion and allow corporations and wealthy investors to conceal their assets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It might interest the chamber that it's not just the Greens that have been campaigning to have a beneficial ownership register put in place in this country to provide transparency on matters related to tax evasion and other unethical behaviour. Previous member of parliament and minister for finance Kelly O'Dwyer is also on record as publicly supporting a beneficial ownership register. She is not only on record; she instituted a process so that we could actually have legislative reform in this area. She announced a consultation paper in 2016 and said that a public register would greatly benefit in the fight against tax avoidance. Minister O'Dwyer at that time said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Improving transparency around who owns, controls and benefits from companies will assist with preventing the misuse of companies for illicit activities including tax evasion, money laundering, bribery, corruption and terrorism financing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But—surprise, surprise—large parts of the corporate sector in this country, including tax lawyers and others, have strongly opposed the government's plan to establish a register and have lobbied very hard to prevent this from happening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've put a number of questions both to the Australian tax office directly and to Treasury at estimates, on notice and in Senate inquiries as to why this reform has never eventuated. It gives me pause for thought that it took 16 years of this issue being raised in parliament before we actually got something as simple as a director identification number. But I want to tell the senators who are interested in this debate what Mr Chris Jordan said when I asked him about his views on a beneficial ownership register. He had a slightly ambivalent view on the need for it. He accepted that anything to do with increasing transparency was good. However, he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A register of beneficial ownership is just, you know, what someone says someone else owns so, you know, it could be good but it could be just a lot of 'stuff' that doesn't really help us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the important point was what he said next:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Because if, you know, people want to do the wrong thing they'll be putting all sorts of different names in places, so I'm not sure it's a panacea as such.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Stop and reflect on that: 'putting different names in place'. The whole point of the legislation before us today is to take away the ability for dodgy operators to put up dodgy names as Australian company directors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I said yesterday that if you go to the Australian Business Register and look up company directors you can find Elvis Presley as an Australian company director. You can find Bob Marley, not to mention Homer Simpson and a whole range of interesting people who are registered as company owners in Australia. That's going to stop when we, hopefully, pass this reform in the Senate today. When we have a modernised registry, the technology structures in place and the ability to give a company director an identification number for life, it will make it a lot easier and a lot more effective to therefore have a beneficial ownership register. I hope that this is just one of many steps in place to see that legislation come before parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would finally like to cover where we're at with a beneficial ownership register. I last asked about this issue in October estimates last year. I put it to Treasury. I said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The government, I understand, is committed to the G20 High-Level Principles on Beneficial Ownership Transparency … </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And I should point out that this is not just an issue in Australia. It's a huge issue in the United Kingdom. They've continually dodged legislation to bring in a beneficial ownership register. You can only guess why. There have certainly been a number of allegations around the fact that this government and the UK government are simply protecting their donors and tax evaders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I asked a question around the international push and whether we were complying. Our commitments made under previous Minister O'Dwyer were 'specific commitments to begin work to implement a government decision on transparency of beneficial ownership companies'. I wanted to know exactly what the government's decision was going to be, and the process. The answer I got was that, yes, 'The government is committed to enabling regulators and law enforcement agencies to tackle illicit activities, such as tax evasion, terrorism financing and money laundering, by giving them access to information on who owns and controls companies, allowing authorities to follow the money and to reveal the natural person that ultimately benefits from a company.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this was part of the government's Open Government National Action Plan in 2016-2018—a plan that expired more than two years ago. I have continually put questions to Treasury, asking: 'Where are we with this? What's happening?' And I get complete and total nonanswers back, as in: 'Government decisions are in that plan, and that's two years old. Take that up with the government.' In other words, there is no momentum in this country at all for a beneficial ownership register.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, the government did consult publicly on this in 2017. Apparently they have consulted on a number of options to improve beneficial ownership transparency, including the establishment of a central register. But the government needs to commit to this, to step up and to make it happen. I hope that Senator Hume, in her contribution today, will be able at least to respond to this, as to where we are with the beneficial ownership register. I know she had a lot of respect for Minister O'Dwyer, who personally wanted to see this register put in place. I even note that previous senator George Brandis supported this initiative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, having director identification numbers due to this legislation today will make it a lot more effective and easier to have a beneficial ownership register. I will finish my contribution on that point.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator VAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:41</span>):  I rise to speak on the Commonwealth Registers Bill 2019 and its associated legislation today. Despite the volume of legislation before us, I know just how important this initiative is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I go into the details of the bill, I would like to recognise this government's continued commitment to ensuring that Australian businesses can survive and thrive in these difficult times. As many people here know, the Morrison government has introduced a number of initiatives to cushion the economic impact of the coronavirus and to help build a bridge to recovery. A total of $260 billion is being injected into the economy by our government in order to keep Australians in work and businesses in business. This includes $83.7 billion for the government's economic stimulus package, $90 billion from the Reserve Bank of Australia, $15 billion from the government to deliver easier access to finance and, lastly, the $70 billion JobKeeper payment. This economic support package is equivalent to 13.3 per cent of our GDP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is taking this unprecedented action to support small businesses, tradies, employees and those who are facing tough times ahead. Support covers casual workers, sole traders, small and medium businesses and also industry sectors such as agriculture, aged care, universities and of course health. It also covers regulatory protection and financial support for businesses to stay in business, giving them the breathing space to work out the best way to keep their businesses moving.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the government's $40 billion SME guarantee scheme, we will support small and medium-sized business enterprises to get access to working capital to help them get through the impact of the virus on their business. The scheme will complement the government's initiative to cut red tape to allow SMEs to get access to credit faster. It also complements announcements made by Australian banks to support small businesses with their existing loans. This builds on the support for business and business investment provided in our economic support packages. That includes increasing the instant asset write-off and, now, extending the $150,000 instant asset write-off for six months, through to 31 December 2020. It also includes backing business investment by providing accelerated depreciation deductions. The package also includes temporary relief for directors from any personal liability for trading while insolvent. The Corporations Act will be amended to provide temporary and targeted relief for companies to deal with unforeseen events that arise as a result of the coronavirus.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, what would these bills do? These actions address the most immediate and pressing needs of business as a whole in these challenging economic times. But we on this side of the chamber are looking ahead to ensure that the economic circumstances recover and that doing business is easier into the future, and these bills help do that. As the Productivity Commission's 2015 report <span style="font-style:italic;">Barriers to business set-up, transfer and closure</span> noted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While it is relatively easy to start a business, a number of longstanding issues with specific regulatory requirements, regulator engagement and funding remain unaddressed. These make entry for some new businesses unnecessarily complex or costly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of the challenge is the need to register and then re-create information needed to register a business. This can cover Commonwealth, state and local government requirements and requires new businesses to expend enormous amounts of time and money to complete. Initiatives such as the Australian business account initiatives and the Australian Business Licence and Information Service have helped overcome some of the information challenges that businesses face in understanding the requirements of registration, licensing and permits at all levels of government. But they also lack the capacity to share data and information easily. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We cannot go on having multiple business registers all over government. By some accounts, in the Commonwealth setting alone there are numerous types of regulatory registers that businesses may have to register on, depending on their circumstances. To me, as a previous small business owner, that is absolutely crazy and creates a red-tape burden full of time-wasting and duplicative effort by business owners. That may be alright for businesses that can afford to employ people to help them with that, but it is an expensive and time-consuming process for small business, especially if they have to deal with state and local government registration requirements as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills, modernising the business registers, will address registry fragmentation, improve business user experience, reduce risks to ongoing operations, foster data-driven innovation and enable better use of registry data. They might even build upon the great work already done in the business account and business licence initiatives. Just imagine a business registration that allows Commonwealth agencies to share ABR data and allows state and local governments to incorporate ABR data into their systems to improve the experience for new businesses starting up in their jurisdictions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To achieve this, the IT infrastructure underpinning Australia's business registry services needs to be addressed to meet demand for registry services now and into the future. No longer can we have government IT systems designed in such a way that they are bespoke, are increasingly complex and cost extraordinary amounts of time to change or modify. Some systems can take up to 40 days of testing just to modify one line of code because they are so complex and interdependent in their design. We have to be able to create an environment where data can be processed, shared and updated easily, to the benefit of government, business and the community as a whole.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To facilitate the implementation of the new registry system, a legislative package has been drafted that creates a new regime that is flexible, technology neutral and governance neutral. With this approach, the registrar will have the flexibility to make data standards that determine what information will be collected, how that information will be collected and the manner in which the information will be maintained. The registrar can make a disclosure framework to provide the basis for disclosing protected information to the public. The disclosure framework is designed to replace a one-size-fits-all approach to publicly available data with one where information is disclosed by using a risk based approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government acknowledges that, while directors and companies have needed the breathing space to deal with the impacts of coronavirus, there are still those who have a history of continually breaking the trust of consumers, employees and partners. This legislation seeks to address this abuse by introducing a requirement for each appointed director of a registered body corporate to have a director identification number, a DIN. The objective of the new DIN requirement is to promote good corporate conduct. In particular, it will assist regulators to detect and address unlawful behaviour and, through doing so, deter such behaviour. The DIN will be a unique identifier for any person who consents to being a director and verifies their identity. The person will keep the DIN forever, even if their directorship with a particular company changes. This, too, is an important initiative that also came from the Productivity Commission's report that argued for greater transparency about and accountability of directors who sought to avoid their obligations through the insidious practice of phoenix companies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my concluding remarks, let me reiterate just how important this initiative is for Australian business. By reducing red tape to make it easier for business, by improving data and information sharing at all levels of government and by helping the better governance of business, the Morrison government is making it possible for businesses to thrive in these difficult economic times. I also acknowledge the hard work of those current and former public servants across government who have striven over the last three-plus years to see this initiative through. While in recent weeks it has been fashionable for the opposition to berate the Treasury portfolio, teams from across the Australian Business Register, ASIC, the ATO and the departments of industry and Treasury, have worked tremendously hard to overcome numerous hurdles and bring this initiative to life. It is through their hard work and professionalism in dealing with such legislative complexity that the government can deliver on its promise to modernise Australian business registers and ensure that there is a modern, effective and efficient registration regime for businesses into the future.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:52</span>):  I rise to speak in support of the Commonwealth Registers Bill 2019. In doing so I want to focus on one measure in particular, and that is the introduction of a director ID number, which will require company directors to provide proof of identification before registering companies. This is something that Labor and many industry and union groups have called for for some time, and I'm glad that finally we are seeing some action from the government on this point.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spoken a lot about this issue, both in this term and in the last term of parliament, because it has particular relevance to a number of regions in my state—in particular, the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast, where, unfortunately, for many, many years we have seen rampant phoenixing of companies, particularly in the construction industry but also in a number of other industries, including the security industry and contract cleaning. One of the things that I've said in talking about this issue in the past is that in the absence of a director ID number it's actually easier in Australia to register yourself as a director of a company than it is to register a dog. When you think about the responsibilities of company directors and the potential for ordinary people to be defrauded by rogue company directors, that is ridiculous. For a long time, we have needed to put in place much stricter restrictions around who can register a company and the ability to trace them. As I said, the issue of phoenixing is a rampant problem in my home state of Queensland, particularly on the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just as a quick reminder, what we're talking about is the ability of company directors to rack up big debts, whether it be to suppliers who supply goods and services to them or to subcontractors who come and do work for them. The big developer or the big building company will get people to do the work, owe them some money and then close down the company, strip the assets out of it in doing so and move those assets to a new company. Then the company director gets on with life but leaves a trail of destruction behind them in the form of suppliers and subcontractors who have provided services, probably incurred debts themselves in doing so, but who remain unpaid. I've met many small, usually mum-and-dad businesses, particularly on the Gold Coast but also the Sunshine Coast, who have been forced to shoulder unsecured debt and have been left in the lurch by big construction companies who go bust without paying their bills, and I think it's particularly important that this step is being taken now because, in the current COVID-19 environment, tradies have got enough to worry about without wondering if they're actually going to get paid for their work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that tradies, other subcontractors, security guards and contract cleaning employees are often owed money for long periods of time anyway. They should actually be getting paid sooner—and, of course, should actually be getting paid—rather than being ripped off by phoenixing company directors. Now, phoenixing is a problem we're likely to see more of as, on this government's watch, we enter a recession, the first recession we've seen in Australia in nearly 30 years. Some experts are even linking an expected rise in phoenixing cases to exactly when federal government support is due to dry up in September, when JobKeeper will end, the safe harbour laws will be removed, banking loans will be called in and the jobseeker additional payment will end. We face a fiscal cliff in September, when a range of support for businesses and individuals is due to dry up. That's exactly the time when we are likely to see more phoenixing activity by rogue directors who don't want to pay their bills, so putting this measure in place will go some way towards protecting people from being ripped off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're already, in fact, hearing reports of a number of businesses on the Gold Coast using coronavirus as an excuse not to pay their subcontractors. That is just not right and it's not fair, and that's why I and a number of other people on the Labor side of this parliament have been speaking up on behalf of those subcontractors for some time. I note that, under the Queensland Minister for Housing and Public Works, Mick de Brenni, the Queensland government has taken significant steps to protect subcontractors and to make sure they get paid. We haven't seen enough action from this federal government up until now. There is much more to be done at the federal level but, to give credit where credit's due, I'm glad that they have eventually got around to introducing the director ID number that we've been calling for for a long time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will give just a couple of local examples. When a major Gold Coast based construction company, MJM Projects, folded in January, it owed workers and subcontractors over $4 million, and they've been told they're not likely to see any of that money. On the Sunshine Coast, the latest high-profile building company collapse has left painters and plumbers trying to claw back massive bills—$150,000 in one case. This is money that they've been chasing for months anyway. Similarly, subbies and trade creditors were owed more than $3.6 million when another major builder, RiCon, entered administration in January. In the last month, we've seen more Queensland businesses come crashing down, including Bulkbuild, a building company which has worked on projects for some of Australia's leading organisations, which owes creditors about $1.6 million, most of it to subcontractors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I say, I've met in person with a number of subcontracting firms, often mum-and-dad businesses, that have been destroyed as a result of crooked corporate conduct, particularly phoenixing. I've met people who have literally lost their homes and lost their marriages because they've been left at the end of a queue, not protected by federal laws, when it comes to getting paid. So I certainly hope that the changes that are being introduced today—we've called for these changes to happen for a long time—will go some way to cracking down on those dodgy, illegal practices and will protect hardworking people, not rich people, from being ripped off by larger, dishonest entities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a lot more to be done at the federal level to tighten laws and enforce the laws that we do have to protect subcontractors from this kind of exploitation. I've asked about this issue in a number of estimates hearings, particularly with ASIC, and I have to say that I haven't been very impressed with the effort that they've put into this topic. I understand that they are a very stretched organisation and that there probably is an issue of resourcing that the government needs to look at. This is a massive problem. It amounts to people being ripped off to the tune of billions of dollars over the course of a year, and ASIC has got to actually take this issue seriously and protect these smaller entities who are being ripped off far too often. There is more to do. We should be policing these issues more. We should be enforcing the laws more than we are. But credit where credit is due—this proposal to introduce a director ID number is good, and that's why we will be supporting the bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:00</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I support the Commonwealth Registers Bill 2019 and the associated package of amending legislation—with reservations. Firstly, there is a growing belief among our governing class that, in many areas, Australian federalism relies on shared endeavour. I do acknowledge that coordinated federalism—where each government works with the other yet retains total determination over, and exercise of, its own constitutional powers—needs some honing today. After all, the internet runs as a thread through our society and connects us all across state borders. Yet this most definitely does not mean transfer of power from the states to the federal government. I'm advocating generally the reverse. We need to send some powers back from the federal government to the state governments in accordance with our Constitution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is fundamental to our Constitution and it is common sense that the best service delivery occurs when the person making a decision is located closest to the people affected by that decision. That is obvious. That is the reverse of what has happened in our country since 1944. The greater the distance apart, the worse the decision-making. We need to stop centralising and restore competitive federalism. Competitive federalism, with six states working independently yet together, is highly effective. Our country was leading the world in per capita income from 1901, when we formed a nation, until about the 1920s, and that was because of competitive federalism. I reiterate that it is very important to get back to competitive federalism, with the states working independently yet together.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, I am concerned that this bill will give the states the chance to wash their hands of responsibility for the integrity of the data in this register. I urge the federal government to ensure that, when this register is designed, there is suitable, effective grievance reporting so that, where a person's entry contains an error or where a person has been mistaken for someone else, they can correct the record. Australians recently saw firsthand a total failure of the federal government's IT function with the chaotic, tragic robodebt scheme. And it's not just a matter of the government making an apology. It's not just a matter of there being an error of close to a billion dollars. It's a matter of wrecking people's lives. It's important to understand that the government never pays for its mistakes; the people do. What I mean by that is the people pay twice—once for what the government did through our taxation system and then through their own hip pockets for the consequences of the government's error. We can see that in relation to the ban on live cattle exports that the Gillard government capriciously put in place. We now see the federal government lining up to take over business registrations, and people know that outsourcing the IT function did not turn out so well for the government last time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, I am concerned that this bill is not about making a better system for controlling business registrations and keeping track of company directors. I am concerned that the government have spotted another chance to sling yet more taxpayers' money at one of their corporate backers. Who will it be? KPMG? Indue? We can hardly wait to find out, but we will be watching.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All parties to this register must show the respect that is required for the Australians whose livelihoods, whose legal liabilities, are bound to this register. Please, Minister, take your time and get it right. Remember our Constitution and competitive federalism. Care about the people you are serving. The government must do better this time because, after all, government is here by permission of the people, on behalf of the people, to serve the people. That service from government must be in accordance with our people's governing document, our national Constitution. </span>

                    <a href="282997" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SCARR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:05</span>):  I'm delighted to rise in this place to speak in favour of the Commonwealth Registers Bill 2019. Before I launch into some of my contributions in this debate, I'd just like to acknowledge some of the contributions of Senator Roberts, from my home state of Queensland. Can I say to you, Senator, I, through the Acting Deputy President, agree wholeheartedly in terms of the need for this country to keep the spirit of competitive federalism—absolutely. I also agree that the people whose information is contained in any of these registers should have the right to rectify any mistakes through a clear procedure where they can make sure that there isn't information contained in these registers that is against their best interests. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I do say to you it is a good thing that we are consolidating some 35 registers under this regime and we don't have 35 registers being operated by each of the six states in this country. I think that would impose a great burden on Australian business. So I think we're moving in the right direction with this legislation. I really do. That is reflected in the context of these amendments. The Australian government has committed to simplifying its interactions with business to support growth, innovation and employment, to make it easier for people to do business in this country, not harder. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Business Simplification Initiative announced in 2016 aims to reduce the time that business spends complying with regulations and interacting with governments so they can focus on growing their business, creating more jobs and developing new products. This nation needs to have a laser-like focus on the creation of new jobs as we build this bridge through the pandemic to recovery. We need a laser-like focus on the creation of those new jobs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This new law facilitates that by setting up a modern government registry regime that is flexible, technology neutral and governance neutral. The regime initially applies to the businesses administered by ASIC and the Australian Business Register. If you needed any reason to know why this legislation is required, all you need to do is to look at the list of registers that are covered by this legislation—the Australian Business Register, the ACN register, the business names register, the Australian registrable bodies register for Australian companies, the Australian registrable bodies register for foreign companies, the reserved names register, the managed investment scheme register, the company charges register et cetera, et cetera—35 of them. You can see why there's a need for legislation such as this. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to place on the record my appreciation, certainly, to all those members of agencies and departments who've been involved in this consolidation project. There are actually 49 pages of consequential amendments arising from this legislation—49 pages of different sections of legislation that are being amended to put this legislation in effect. That constitutes a great workload which has been conducted and delivered by the servants of this nation who work for the good of this country. I really do congratulate each and every one of them for being involved in that project. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as the consolidation of the governance of these 35 disparate registers, another important aspect of this legislation is the director identification number. This is something that was proposed in the 2015 Productivity Commission report entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Business </span><span style="font-style:italic;">set-up, transfer and closure</span>. That report referred to the fact that, as my friend Senator Watt from Queensland referred to, the issue of phoenixing is one which impacts Australians all across the country. I know that this has been the subject of different Senate committees and inquiries—and my friend Senator Whish-Wilson has been involved in many of those inquiries. And I congratulate all the senators who have been involved in those inquiries and made those recommendations. I've been listening to your contributions to this debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Illegal phoenixing is a scourge—an absolute scourge. It impacts on small businesses, employees and taxpayers, because every action of illegal phoenixing, which means that employees aren't paid what they're entitled to, means the federal government has to do what the owners of those companies should have done, and stump up for those employee entitlements under the Fair Entitlements Guarantee scheme. This is an important plank in building our response to illegal phoenixing, but this government has previously taken action in order to combat illegal phoenixing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the Treasury Laws Amendment (Combating Illegal Phoenixing) Act 2020, which I spoke for, new phoenixing offences were introduced. There was a prohibition of backdating resignations or leaving companies directorless, which was a key component of the illegal phoenixing strategy. I think it was quite unfair of my friend Senator McAllister to yesterday criticise the federal government for not taking action, because the record is that the government has been taking action over the last several years. That also includes the establishment of an ATO task force to combat illegal phoenixing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to the director identification number provisions contained in the bill, each director must have a specific number—a unique identifier. That director identification number will follow that director, and the regulators, administrators and liquidators will be able to follow whether or not a director repeatedly keeps turning up as a director of companies. I want to draw out how effective this could be in the context of illegal phoenixing activity. There was an example given in the Productivity Commission's report in 2015 of a labour hire business which had negligible assets and a turnover of $30 million per annum and which fragmented its operations across 53 related companies. It lodged accurate BASS statements for all the companies but failed to remit the required amounts under the PAYG system. The single company director—one director across 53 different companies—then liquidated every one of those 53 companies within a week and moved his workforce of 2,700. This wasn't just a small one-off commercial establishment. There were 2,700 employees. He moved his whole workforce of 2,700 into eight new entities—eight new companies—and continued trading. He has since fled Australia. Over $8 million in taxes remain unpaid. This labour hire business was still trading and failing to comply with its obligations at the time that the Productivity Commission actually delivered its report. I think that is a great example of how a director identification number could be used to combat that sort of behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How? This bill contains a number of offences and civil penalties in relation to the director identification number. First, the obligation is that you actually apply for a director identification number, if directed by the registrar. The maximum penalty for not doing so is 60 penalty units under criminal law or a civil penalty unit greater than 5,000 penalty units or three times the benefit derived or detriment avoided because of the contravention. So there is both a criminal element and a civil element to the penalty, and that is absolutely appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The rogue, the ratbag, whatever we want to call him, who set up those 53 companies and then liquidated them and moved to the other eight companies would have been required to apply for his director identification number before he set up even his first company. When he set up the second, he would have had to apply the same director identification number. If our rogue applied for an additional director identification number, that would be an offence under this legislation. If our rogue misrepresented a director identification number, that would also be an offence under this legislation. If someone acted as an accessory to help him in establishing this convoluted scheme—and, based on my experience, it's difficult to set up 53 companies or, in this case, 61 companies, without the assistance of some people—then they would also be in contravention under this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, as Senator Whish-Wilson referred to yesterday, we have to move away from a situation where we have directors with names such as Elvis Presley and Bob Marley. I wish some of these great performers of the past could return to the stage of today from the stage in the sky, I truly do. They are some of my favourite performers. I wish they could reappear in today's society, absolutely. I listen to their works quite often. It would be laughable if it weren't so serious. It really would. As Senator Watt said, it is easier to become a director and be registered in this country than it is to register a dog or to get a library card or to rent a DVD, if anyone does that anymore. I'm not sure they do. I'm showing my age! It's harder to do all of those things than it is to actually become a director and take on all those responsibilities under the Corporations Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're talking here of not just fictitious directors, people who don't exist, but also vulnerable people who are persuaded, by whatever means, to become directors of companies. The fact that there will be a verification and authentication process in this regard will make it harder for the rogues who are out there to use their manipulative techniques to convince people to expose themselves by becoming directors. That is a really important part of the scheme.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I'm extremely pleased to have the opportunity to speak in favour of this bill. I have heard and reflected on some of the comments that have been made about the time it has taken for this legislation to be considered in this place. It gave me cause to reflect on the fact that Minister Hunt as Minister for Health has often alluded to the fact that we've introduced the telehealth scheme, which we thought would take 10 years, in 10 days. Maybe we should look for other opportunities where we can expedite the introduction of legislation to deal with a whole range of matters that are in the best interests of the Australian community.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUME</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Superannuation, Financial Services and Financial Technology</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:17</span>):  Firstly, I would like to thank those senators who have contributed to this debate. Schedule 1 of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Registries Modernisation and Other Measures) Bill 2019 will provide the legislative flexibility for the government to modernise Australia's business registers onto a single platform to be administered by the Australian Business Register, within the Australian Taxation Office. Modernising the business registers will address registry fragmentation, improve business user experience, reduce risks of ongoing operating, foster data-driven innovation and enable better use of registry data.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The IT infrastructure underpinning Australia's business registry services has been found wanting and needs to be upgraded to meet current and future demands. To facilitate the implementation of a new registry system, a legislative package has been drafted that is flexible, technology neutral and governance neutral. The modernising business registers legislative regime will allow a registrar, a Commonwealth body appointed by the minister, to create data standards and disclose frameworks to assist them in carrying out the registry functions and powers. The data standards will allow the registrar the flexibility to determine what information will be collected, how the information will be collected and the manner in which the information will be maintained. This flexible approach will ensure that the registrar can utilise the latest technology and practices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Director identification numbers are being progressed as part of the modernising business registers program. Schedule 2 of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Registries Modernisation and Other Measures) Bill 2019 provides for the introduction of a legal framework for director identification numbers which will require all directors, and alternate directors, of registered bodies to have a unique identifier. Administrative details, such as how to apply for a director identification number, will be determined by the registrar or registrars appointed by the minister in due course. Importantly, once a director has been issued with a director identification number, that unique number will remain with them forever, meaning their directorships across companies and over time can be easily tracked. This will assist regulators and external administrators to investigate a director's involvement in what may be unlawful activity, including illegal phoenixing activity, which has been a perennial problem for successive governments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Director IDs are being progressed as part of the modernising business registers program for two key reasons. First, doing so ensures that the director ID is integrated with other important registry data. This will provide greater insights to regulators, to businesses and to individuals on the identity and affiliations of directors. Having all business registry data linked will help with risk profiling and to combat illegal phoenixing. Second, ASIC's registers are ageing and outdated. Adding large amounts of functionality to registers that will soon be replaced will be very costly, likely increase the instability of ASIC's systems and also offer limited anti-illegal-phoenixing benefits. Moreover, ASIC does not have an identity verification progress. Progressing director IDs as part of the modernising business registers program will also allow director IDs to use the most advanced identity verification processes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The modernising business registers program will be delivered iteratively over a number of years. However, director IDs will be one of the earliest deliverables on the new, modernised platform. The government will closely monitor the effectiveness and progress of the entire program on an ongoing basis. I commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McALLISTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:23</span>):  I rise to speak to the Treasury Laws Amendment (2019 Measures No. 3) Bill 2019. Labor will be supporting this bill. There are three schedules to the bill and, in turn, these address matters relating to testamentary trusts, deferral of education and training standards for existing advisers, and miscellaneous amendments as part of the routine process of updating provisions and correcting errors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 to the bill implements a 2018-19 budget measure and closes a loophole that allows testamentary trusts of deceased estates to be used for tax evasion purposes. It is designed to ensure the tax concessions available to minors in relation to income from a testamentary trust only apply in respect of income generated from assets of the deceased estate that are transferred to the testamentary trust, or the proceeds of the disposal or investment of those assets. In effect, the law as it stands means that testamentary trusts can be used as a vehicle to minimise tax because income other than that resulting from a deceased estate can be transferred into them. Under present circumstances, the income minors receive from testamentary trusts is taxed at adult marginal rates, which access the $18,200 tax-free threshold. Some taxpayers, therefore, are able to appropriately obtain the benefits of this lower tax rate by injecting assets unrelated to the deceased estate into the testamentary trust. The government wants to close the loophole, and we fully support it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The effect of schedule 1 is that income from testamentary trusts will be limited to income derived from the assets that are transferred from deceased estates or the proceeds of the disposal or the investment of those assets, and this is appropriate. But nobody should be under any illusion that this is a substantial reform. As the 2018-19 budget said, 'The measure was estimated to have a small, unquantifiable gain to revenue over the forward estimates period.' We shouldn't count on this measure to direct rivers of gold into the Treasury any time soon. If the government wants to be taken seriously, and this is a very big if, then it should bring into this chamber serious proposals in relation to tax avoidance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 to the bill amends the Corporations Act to defer the transitional time frames for existing providers to comply with the education and training standards, requiring completion of an approved degree or equivalent qualification and the standard requiring the passing of an approved exam. The transitional time frame for the approved degree or equivalent qualification will be deferred by two years, to 1 January 2026. The transitional time frame for the approved exam will be deferred by one year, to 1 January 2022. These are unfortunate but necessary amendments. They arise from the government's mishandling of the professional standards for financial adviser reforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In March 2017 reforms were introduced into the Corporations Act by the Corporations Amendment (Professional Standards of Financial Advisers) Act to raise the education, training and ethical standards of financial advisers. These reforms passed the parliament with bipartisan support over three years ago. They set new standards for financial advisers. They were intended to progressively come into effect from 1 January 2019. However, the body appointed by the government, the Financial Adviser Standards and Ethics Authority, was extremely slow to set the standards. As a result, financial advisers have been placed in the very difficult position of being asked to comply with the standards and complete exams at incredibly short notice. The government's decision to defer the educational and exam requirements now is appropriate, but it should have been entirely unnecessary. It is only the result, and exclusively the result, of the implementation failures of the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regrettably, we are in a position where we support a deferral of the deadlines. We understand that it is necessary. But when the parliament passes legislation it has every expectation that it will be implemented by the executive within the time frames in the legislation. It is a terrible failing by this government—a failure that has placed impossible pressures on financial advisers to comply with the new standards and that sees the Senate placed in this position.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 of the bill makes a number of minor and technical amendments to laws relating to taxation, superannuation, corporations and credit. These amendments correct typographical and numbering errors. They bring provisions into line with modern drafting conventions, they repeal inoperative divisions, they remove administrative inefficiencies, they address unintended outcomes and they update references. Essentially, they help to improve Treasury laws to operate as intended. And they were recommended by the 2008 Tax Design Review Panel.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation contains necessary changes. It implements a long-delayed budget measure to close a small tax loophole. It defers a previously legislated time frame that has not been met and it makes minor revisions to various laws through a process recommended by the 2008 Tax Design Review Panel. All these things are necessary. Some of these things could have been avoided.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the House of Representatives, Labor proposed amendments to this bill to remove the legislative exemption from conflicted remuneration rules for financial advisers in relation to the selling of units or shares in listed investment trusts and listed investment companies. Labor first introduced a ban on conflicted remuneration in 2012. But in 2014 this government introduced a loophole for listed investment vehicles, and that enabled billions of dollars worth of shares in units to be sold on the basis of commissions, costing mum-and-dad investors millions. As the shadow minister for financial services, Mr Jones, has said, ordinary investors were left exposed to complex, opaque and underperforming products because of this dud legislation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has been putting pressure on the government to remove this loophole for nearly a year. We have proposed moving these same amendments in the Senate, but we acknowledge that the Treasurer has finally come to the table. The Treasurer has committed to remove the conflicted remuneration exemptions for listed investment and listed investment trusts. Last week, he issued draft regulations to that effect for consultation. So today we are withdrawing our amendments in good faith. But, if the final regulations are not up to scratch, are not issued in a timely manner or don't adequately protect ordinary Australian investors, then we will be returning to the parliament to address this issue again.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor gives credit to the government for acting on this important issue, but this is a commonsense decision and it should have been arrived at far earlier. I thank the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  I rise to speak in support of the Treasury Laws Amendment (2019 Measures No. 3) Bill 2019. Centre Alliance fully supports the provisions in the bill. I won't repeat the purpose of the bill—Senator McAllister has done a fantastic job articulating what the bill seeks to achieve. However, I will be moving an amendment in the committee stage and I just want to talk about that amendment now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My amendment will rid the Federal Register of Legislation of a perverse provision in the Corporations Act which exempts some large proprietary companies from having to lodge financial reports. That includes financial statements and directors' declarations to ASIC. This is highly problematic for a couple of reasons. Firstly, it inappropriately leaves in place an elite or privileged class of companies that do not have to lodge ASIC reports. If my amendment passes, then that inequity will no longer continue. We cannot have a legislative privilege in Australia—in an Australia which does not take kindly to these sorts of privileges.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the opaqueness created by not filing accounts with ASIC creates an environment that may well encourage the aggressive tax minimisation behaviour that the government says it is trying to combat. I would also add that, when an entity wants to have dealings with a company, one of the things they do is go to ASIC and seek information about the company which may help them to make decisions about whether or not they want to trade or deal with that particular company. That is not possible for these companies.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Do you know what? So far as I can tell, that review never took place, despite the Senate commanding that it should. I asked at estimates whether or not ASIC could find evidence of a review, and nothing came back in relation to that. So we can comfortably assume that the review did not take place.</span>

One of the submissions it received, submission No. 32, was from ASIC, who raised the concern about these exempted companies. That led the Senate economics committee to ultimately recommend:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My amendment will implement the recommendation—which was, in effect, initiated by ASIC—that was made to the Senate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no reasonable excuse—I repeat: there is no reasonable excuse—for the coalition not supporting this amendment. I put the question to the minister in the last estimates about the government's response to this Senate report, and—noting it was a 2015 report—I got the answer: 'The government is still considering its response to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Corporate tax avoidance</span><span style="font-style:italic;">: p</span><span style="font-style:italic;">art III</span><span style="font-style:italic;">: m</span><span style="font-style:italic;">uch heat, little light so far</span> report.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In practical terms, my amendment removes the special status of these exempt companies. Currently, there are 1,119 exempt companies, owned by some very familiar names—names that the Liberal Party will know very, very well. They will have to lodge financial reports with ASIC going forward. They'll be subject to the same scrutiny as everybody else. Colloquially, the current situation doesn't pass the pub test, and, indeed, this elitism would be banned from even entering the pub. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:36</span>): The Treasury Laws Amendment (2019 Measures No. 3) Bill 2019 is an omnibus bill that makes a number of minor changes relating to taxation, superannuation, corporations and credit. One of the key provisions in the bill is to change the tax concessions available to minors from a testamentary trust. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The measure in the bill I would like to focus my attention on in this second reading contribution is an amendment to the Corporations Act which defers the education and training standards for existing financial advisers. The transitional time frames for an approved degree or equivalent qualification will be deferred by two years, to 1 January 2026, and the transitional time frame for the passing of an approved exam will be deferred by one year, to 1 January 2022. In a nutshell, this is the deferral of the implementation of the Financial Adviser Standards and Ethics Authority, or FASEA, reforms. Labor have offered bipartisan support for these reforms, and we also support this amendment, but the deferral of the FASEA reforms is only necessary because of the absolute shambles this government has made of them. It's almost 11 years since the parliamentary inquiry into financial products and services handed down its report; eight years since the Future of Financial Advice, or FOFA reforms; five years since the government's announcement of the FASEA reforms; three years since the establishment of the authority; and 18 months since the new requirements commenced. The government have had plenty of time to get this right, yet their revolving door of leaders, finance ministers, treasurers and assistant treasurers hasn't helped the process—neither has FASEA going through three different CEOs in the first 18 months. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The incompetence and failures in the implementation of these reforms have led to ongoing delays, which have had a detrimental impact on both financial advisers and their customers. For customers, it means that they remain at the mercy of those few financial advisers who are acting unethically and failing to represent their clients' interests first. For financial advisers, the overwhelming majority of whom are acting professionally and ethically, it has led to frustration and uncertainty about their future in the profession. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been a lack of consultation around the reforms, and the feedback that has been received has resulted in barely any changes. Professional standards were released only days before they were due to come into effect. We heard, in the House of Representatives second reading debate on this bill, of concerns raised by some financial advisers that almost every financial adviser in Australia would be in breach of the standards because of FASEA's delay in releasing their final guidance. Remember that it was as late as mid-October last year when the Treasurer announced in a media release that a code of ethics would be released and all financial advisers would be required to adhere to it by 1 January 2020. It was even later—mid-November—when the Australian Securities and Investments Commission assured advisers that they would not be in breach of the law because they were unable to register with an ASIC-approved compliance scheme by 1 January 2020.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent months, much of the anger and frustration has arisen from the exam that financial advisers have been required to pass by January 2021. I've had numerous representations to my office about this issue. Six months of exam preparation time was lost to financial advisers because of the delays in FASEA releasing exam guidance. When the guidance was finally released, it was very vague and gave limited information to financial advisers about what topics would be examined and how they should prepare for the exam. The first exam was held entirely in metropolitan areas, which made it difficult for many advisers to attend.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the key problems that have been raised with me by financial advisers in relation to the exam is the lack of feedback on exam performance. This is particularly frustrating for those advisers who have failed and need to study again to resit the exam. The exam covers three domains of knowledge—specifically, financial advice regulatory and legal obligations, applied ethical and professional reasoning and communication, and financial advice construction. For candidates who have failed an exam, the statement of results highlights the broad domain of knowledge areas they need to focus on. This high-level feedback is very unhelpful in helping candidates know what topics they need to study. Of the 470 advisers who sat the April exam, around 16 or 17 per cent were sitting it for the second time, according to a report by the publication <span style="font-style:italic;">Professional Planner</span>. Only 50 per cent of those advisers sitting the exam for the second time passed. For those advisers who have failed the exam twice, it must be incredibly frustrating not only to have to sit the exam a third time but to be given almost no clues as to why they have failed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll give you an idea of why they are so frustrated. It costs close to $600 to sit the exam each time, and sittings are available only every two to three months. To add further uncertainty, it takes around six to eight weeks after the exam to get the results. This means that a financial adviser who has failed twice may have spent around six months trying to pass the exam, paid $1,200 in sitting fees and taken many hours out from doing work for their clients to prepare for the exam. After all that, they've got nothing to show for it. They still have no guarantee that investing time in further study will allow them to keep working in their industry—an industry that some have been in for decades. It's hard to imagine the anxiety that some financial advisers must be experiencing when they have a black cloud like this hanging over their future in their profession and no clear answers about what they need to do to clear it up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For an industry which in the past has faced a number of scandals involving conflicted remuneration, from which many Australians have suffered, it's not unreasonable to require that its practitioners adhere to professional standards. It brings financial planning into line with a number of professions with similar requirements—medical practitioners, lawyers and accountants, to name a few. I say it's not unreasonable, but the Morrison government have made the requirements unreasonable through their poor handling of this reform. They have expected financial advisers to pass an exam in an environment where the standards and exam guidance were released late, the exam guidance and feedback are vague, and the first exam sittings were difficult to access. They have, once again, completely bungled what should have been a straightforward reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has amendments to this bill that will remove the exemption from conflicted remuneration rules for financial advisers in relation to selling of units or shares in listed investment trusts and listed investment companies. This exemption was part of the Liberals' winding back of Labor's FOFA reforms. Since 2015 the market for listed investment companies and listed investment trusts has doubled to $45 billion, yet these products have performed very poorly, with an average return since 2015 of minus 6.1 per cent. There is absolutely no reason to keep the exemptions for LICs and LITs, and ASIC agrees. ASIC supported Labor's position when they told <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Financial Review</span> almost one year ago:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Conflicted remuneration in financial services should be prohibited or removed as a general policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The banking royal commission also recommended considering the remaining exemptions to the ban on conflicted remunerations and whether each one remained justified. I can't see how the exemption for LICs and LITs remains justified when they are underperforming and advisers are earning commissions of between one and three per cent on them. The winding back by those opposite of Labor's FOFA reforms was a backwards step and one for which investors continue to suffer by being encouraged to invest against their own interests in high-risk and poorly performing products. I'm disappointed that the government has chosen to play politics with Labor's amendments and to blame our amendments on its own decisions to delay this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In an 11 May article in <span style="font-style:italic;">Professional Planner</span>, Senator Hume described our amendments as a backflip and as having been moved at the eleventh hour. They are neither, and those opposite know it and should stop misleading the industry. Yes, the amendments were withdrawn in the House and, yes, they were reintroduced in the Senate, but, since the amendments were first moved in February, we have made it abundantly clear to the government that they will remain on the agenda. I'll happily agree with the government that industry has a right to be angry about this delay, but any anger it expresses should be directed squarely at the government. Given the anger that's already been directed at the government by the financial services industry for their mismanagement of the FASEA reforms, it is of little surprise that the government have tried to deflect some of the anger towards us, even if they had to reinvent history to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Rather than play political games, the government should be directing their energy towards giving the industry certainty. I'm sure a competent government would be capable of making improvements to the exam process that satisfactorily address the concerns of the industry without diminishing the quality of ethical standards that the exam is designed to uphold. When this bill passes, those opposite need to own up to their mistakes and dedicate the additional time parliament has given them to getting this reform right. This will need further discussions with financial advisers to understand the concerns they have and the barriers they are facing in completing and passing the exam.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are not hearing from this government in its contributions on this bill or any other public forum is an apology to all those financial advisers who've been thrown into turmoil by its mishandling of these reforms. No-one in the government has the honesty or the guts to fess up and say, 'Yes, we stuffed this up; we got it wrong and we're sorry.' The extension provided by this bill is a tactical admission of the monumental mess the Morrison government has made of these reforms. If they are going to admit by their deeds that they got this so badly wrong, why not have the courage to follow that with an admission in words as well? How can financial advisers and their clients have any faith that those opposite are truly committed to fixing this mess if they can't admit to making the mess in the first place? This is the Liberal Party, the party which claims to encourage enterprise, which claims to stand up for and look after small business, yet it has failed thousands of small businesses in this sector so dismally. This is supposedly the party that is so committed to deregulation and to reducing red tape, for which we had to sit and listen to lectures on regulation when it introduced its ridiculous omnibus repeal bill. We listened to lectures on red tape while they introduced bills which removed out-of-date legislation and corrected punctuation delivering absolutely zero benefit for business. This massive debacle and the distress it caused financial advisers clearly show that the Liberals' small-business advocacy and red-tape-reduction credentials are non-existent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the absolute mess they've made of an important reform for the financial services sector adds to a ton of evidence against the ridiculous myth that those opposite are superior economic managers. Given their recent $60 billion JobKeeper blunder, the robodebt debacle and the sports rorts scandal, I'm surprised that any Australian would trust them to run a chook raffle, let alone the country. But, hopefully, with another year's grace, the government will have enough time to clean up the mess they've made of FASEA. Let's hope these reforms can still be salvaged, because, when it comes to accountability in the financial services sector, Australians have very little faith in the government that voted 26 times against the banking royal commission and dragged its feet for years on payday lending.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor remains 100 per cent behind the establishment of FASEA and the requirements for financial advisers to meet educational standards, to pass a professional exam, to have professional experience and to meet continuing professional development requirements. We know from evidence given to the banking royal commission and other previous inquiries that, sadly, a minority of financial advisers put their own interests ahead of those of their clients, and we also know that investors suffer as a result. But it is important to acknowledge that the majority of financial advisers do act with high ethical standards and look after the interests of their clients.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The incompetent hand that this government has played in the implementation of the FASEA reforms has two groups of victims: financial advisers who do the right thing, who act ethically and who look after their clients; and the customers of those financial advisers who don't. So I hope, for the sake of all those affected, that, with the passage of this bill, the Morrison government can fix their mistakes and get this reform right. I commend the bill to the Senate, and I urge the government and the crossbench to make sure this bill goes through.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In that context, I just want to take the chamber to an article that was written by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> data journalist Nick Evershed back in 2015, when this was very topical. He basically compared the grandfathered list against the Australian Electoral Commission's donation records covering 1998 to 2014, and government contracts from AusTender covering 2007 to 2014. What he found was that 132 had given money to either the Labor Party or the Liberal Party or one of their associates, and 133 of the companies still on the list had held government contracts worth a total of $2.3 billion. I'm happy to say that that's not stopping Labor from supporting this. They get it. This is a very, very unfair arrangement where select people, well-known businesspeople, are exempt from the requirements that apply to every other large proprietary company in lodging returns to ASIC. I just hope that is not the basis of the government's rejection of this amendment, and I look forward to hearing what the minister has to say.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:56</span>):  Labor will be supporting this amendment, as Senator Patrick has already indicated. This is an old regime. It's a regime that was put in place in 1995, and it provides very significant exemptions for a narrow set of companies. Companies on this list are owned by some of the wealthiest Australians. You can't even get off the list, I understand; those who've tried to take themselves off the list, including, I think, former Prime Minister Turnbull, were unable to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a sensible amendment. It's an amendment that, as the minister has noted, was canvassed in the Senate committee's work around corporate tax avoidance. The private companies that are on this list—very rich and very powerful people—are benefiting from an unfair grandfathering regime. As the title of the Senate report indicates, 'you cannot tax what you cannot see'. Why should these people be removed of their obligations to report transparently in the way that other companies do? Newer companies—and when I say 'newer', I mean companies founded since 1995—have to comply with very sensible, ordinary ASIC requirements. While there may have been genuine policy reasons in the past for this exemption, the time for this exemption is over. If the Liberals, as they've indicated, won't back this amendment, then they need to explain to the public why it is that they are standing up for a special privileges regime that benefits the old, the wealthy and the very, very powerful.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:58</span>):  The Greens will of course be supporting this amendment today. We moved a very similar amendment in 2018—in fact, almost identical to this amendment—with, I note, the support of Labor. We have long fought for tax transparency in Australia. In his contribution, Senator Patrick talked about the groundbreaking Senate inquiry that, I'm very proud to say, many of us in this chamber contributed to. It was initiated by my former colleague Senator Christine Milne, Leader of the Greens, after being lobbied for by the Tax Justice Network, Micah Challenge and a number of stakeholders at the time, going back to 2013. When people knock on our door and say, 'Can we come and see you and talk about an issue?'—and these were community groups and church groups saying, 'What can we do about tax justice?'—I often say to them, 'Look at that as an example of how you can achieve something when you come to this place and you sit down with your elected representatives.' Senator Milne initiated that inquiry. It ran for a number of years and it made some very significant recommendations for reform. Recommendation 13 for reform was to get rid of this grandfathering amendment. I'm very proud that we achieved a fantastic Senate report taking witness evidence right around the country from hundreds of stakeholders. Not all of it's been legislated, sadly, but a lot of it has. I'm very pleased that Senator Patrick has brought this back today. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's no coincidence that, looking at the numbers in that <span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> report, some have expired—about 1,498 private companies back in 2015 were exempted from providing a full set of financial accounts to ASIC. I'm not sure what the policy reasons were that Senator McAllister was referring to that may have been legitimate at the time. I can't see any at all, except perhaps there was an impasse around legislation. However, transparency should be in our genes. There should be no reason at all that any company gets preferential treatment. Looking at the current numbers, I don't think it's any coincidence that nearly 10 per cent of these companies are donors to the Liberal Party. Nearly 10 per cent have contracts, and of course the Liberal Party have a lot of explaining to do if they don't vote for this today. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More importantly, since 2018, this chamber has had the appetite to pass this amendment to any piece of legislation, as was evidenced when the Greens did this with Labor back in 2018. The appetite for transparency, however, I don't believe is as strong in that other place down the corridor through that door. We're about to find out, when this amendment passes today, whether the Liberal Party is going to finally turn its back on this outdated, totally unjustified exemption for some of the biggest and wealthiest companies, and families and individuals, in this country to not provide full details of their financial affairs to the regulator. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Making these things public is absolutely critical. There is a public good component to this providing information—luckily there are people out there who spend a lot of their time looking at the tax affairs of companies—because it is all about social justice; it is all about paying your fair share. If you don't have the disclosure, you're never going to get the reform. The two things go hand in glove. So we're pleased, Senator Patrick, and thank you for acknowledging the role the Greens played when we did move a very similar amendment back in 2018. I hope, if we don't have success this time round, that we continue to plug away until we do. The Greens commend this amendment.</span>

We acknowledge the office of Senator Rex Patrick in putting this forward and we thank them very much for doing so. It is yet another example of how the elites have their fingers into the two major parties. That needs to stop. We need to have a much more transparent system and we need to also have a much more transparent and fair taxation system. We need a comprehensive review of the whole taxation system, because there have been so many people butchering this since the 1940s and 1950s. Indeed, I go back to 1953, when the Prime Minister of the time, Robert Menzies, introduced the double taxation act that made it possible for foreign multinational companies to pay no company tax at all. That leaves a burden on Australians, Australian companies and Australian families. </span>

Noting there are cuts across the public space, ASIC has provided a list of the 1,119 companies that still remain on the list—and I thank ASIC for providing this in response to a question that I put to them at estimates. I'm just wondering if you could tell the chamber how many Liberal donors are on this list.</span>

I'm not aware of whether there are any donors there or whether there aren't any donors there. Donations are of course a matter for the Liberal and National party organisations. And, as Senator Patrick knows very well, donations are declared with the AEC in accordance with section 314AB(1) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. Political donations are openly and transparently disclosed, and the register is publicly available on the AEC website.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:06</span>):  I just want to respond to a comment that was made by Senator Whish-Wilson, because I think people will be watching this. I know that there are not a lot of financial advisers looking at this, because my office has been bombarded by calls from people concerned that this amendment, when it passes, will in fact cause the bill to go back to the other place and then sit there, and nothing will happen to this bill. Now, firstly, I just want to make sure that all those financial advisers understand that this bill is being supported by the Senate and that it has an amendment to correct an anomaly that creates a privileged class of companies here in Australia, which is no longer acceptable to Australians. I will just foreshadow—just advise what I've indicated privately to other senators in this chamber—that, when the bill goes back to the House, if it sits there, every Treasury bill that has the right constitutional hook will have this amendment moved to it. If you want to stop all the bills passing through the House for the purposes of protecting your financial mates, then that's how this is going to play out. So, when it goes back to the House, I urge you to deal with it and deal with it in accordance with the public interest that I've talked about in my second reading contribution and that Senator Whish-Wilson talked about as well.</span>

I was on that committee with Senator Dastyari when the report was finally released. We're talking about many, many years. There's been no attempt to address it at all. But thank you for saying that you will address it. I'll take you at your word on that. But my question—and it's very important for you now to explain to the Senate and anyone who may be listening to this debate—is: in your understanding, please, what is the public policy purpose of having grandfathered exemptions that were in place in 1995 and were designed to be temporary, as Senator Patrick outlined? Indeed, it was Mr John Howard who kept them in place deliberately, as a policy decision. So it's your government that kept them in place. Can you explain to the Senate the policy purpose of having those exemptions and why you believe they should stay in place and why you're going to vote against them today?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:09</span>):  Minister, with due respect, you've already responded to that Senate inquiry report, unless there's another report that you're referring to. Perhaps you could clarify that for us today. As I mentioned in my contribution, there's been—and good on the government—some legislative reform following that groundbreaking Senate inquiry initiated by the Greens. I'm asking you this again. You are a minister of the Crown, of the Commonwealth government. What is your understanding of why grandfathered exemptions have a public policy purpose? What is their public policy purpose? I think it's really important for your government to stand up today and at least provide an explanation as to why you're not going to support Senator Patrick's amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It may be that you don't feel it's related to what we have in this bill here today, but it is technically allowed. I would note that on the multinational anti-avoidance law bill that came in in 2015—which, by the way, was the most significant reform around tax avoidance that this chamber had seen in a decade—the Greens supported your government in good faith to get that bill through here. We also managed to achieve transparency on private companies worth over $200 million, making their accounts publicly available in, unfortunately, a fairly simplified format. Your government agreed to that amendment at the time to get the multinational anti-avoidance bill through. You could have given the same argument—that it wasn't technically related to the MAAL bill. Nevertheless, in hindsight, I think we all agree it was a good thing. Of course, I'm sure the Labor Party and the Greens would like more disclosure—at a lower threshold than $200 million. That's something I believe Labor have moved in this chamber since then.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just for the record, please explain to us why we need to provide grandfathered exemptions for some of the wealthiest individuals and companies in this country. Why should they not have to disclose their financial affairs when other companies have to? Private citizens all put in their tax returns. They do the right thing. They know the consequences if they don't. Why is it that big companies shouldn't be providing these accounts to ASIC?</span>

I think it would be very difficult for both Senator Whish-Wilson and Senator Patrick to deny that this government has done more than any other to ensure that everyone is paying the right amount of tax and has taken more action than any previous government to close loopholes and ensure the ATO has the tools and resources that it needs to deter tax avoidance. With the Greens' and Centre Alliance's support, the Tax Avoidance Taskforce was set up in July 2016. The ATO had their resources increased dramatically, by $679 million over four years, specifically to target anti-avoidance activities by domestic and multinational enterprises, Australian public and private groups, and wealthy individuals operating in Australia. I can also inform the Senate that, as of 30 April this year, the task force has 44 audits underway, covering 42 multinationals.</span>

The MAAL bill is a really good example of that. It kind of makes it even more important for you to explain why this anomaly exists, why you're allowing this grandfathering to continue. If you do believe in transparency and you do believe in tax justice—and I once again commend your government for the measures that you've brought before this place and the spirit of cooperation with which we've all worked on this together—it does seem very unusual and a significant anomaly that you would allow this exemption to remain in place. Of course, perception is everything in politics. You understand that as well as any of us here do. You need to provide an explanation as to why this grandfathering should remain in place.</span>

If you promise us here in the chamber today that you're going to address this issue, then it may cause trouble for Senator Patrick. So perhaps it would be useful for you to consider that as an option—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments go to the crux of the issue that has been festering during this COVID crisis—that the arts and entertainment industry in Australia has been absolutely crippled by the impact of the lockdown and the health restrictions. Of course those were things that needed to be put in place, but it was the arts and entertainment sector that overnight was shut down. Overnight, individual workers lost their jobs. Overnight, hundreds of thousands—millions—of dollars were lost because of events being cancelled, gigs closed and festivals postponed. We are not even sure when these things are going to be able to reopen and what business as normal will look like, going forward. Of course, while the arts and entertainment sector was a hard-hit industry and felt the impacts straightaway, we know that, because of those large group gatherings, because of the nature of the arts and entertainment sector, it will be one of the last sectors to get out of this COVID crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Much has been spoken about in relation to these issues, and of course the Prime Minister over a week ago referenced the fact that he understood that there were some industries that would need specific support and help. Some months ago, late in the evening, when we were debating the rescue packages being put forward by the government, I stood in this place and argued that there needed to be a package specific to the arts and entertainment industry before more jobs were lost and before more businesses went to the wall. Sadly, that didn't happen. Some people, of course, have been able to access JobKeeper, but many within the industry have been left out in the cold. But the big question will come in September when JobKeeper ends. The arts and entertainment industry will not be in a position come September to resume and to snap back, as the government continues to insist it will. It just won't be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, several months on, I'm now pleading with the government again and for all in this place to insist that the Minister for Finance, who has the ability—on rules that have already been agreed to by this place and the other—to fund a specific package for arts and entertainment. I understand that this is an amendment that is quite separate to the rest of this bill, but it is important, it is urgent and we are facing an arts and entertainment emergency. It's totally lawful to do it. It's about whether you want to. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I specifically haven't put a figure in this amendment, because I want that to be based on the best advice that Treasury, the finance minister and the arts minister have and on what the Prime Minister is willing to cough up. This amendment requires the government to at least spend something on an industry that is going bust day after day. Every day we wait for something to be put on the table is another day another Australian artist, entertainer or creative worker loses their job. Every day we wait for something to be put on the table, another business goes to the wall. Many of these businesses are small businesses. They employ a handful of people, but that is their livelihood.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Other industries have been acknowledged as needing specific support. We heard last week the Prime Minister make an announcement about the housing and construction industry. The arts and entertainment industry have lost almost one-third of their workforce. They are in desperate need of assistance and support. We can't wait for movement on this until we come back to this place in August. We need to do something about it today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister is already on the record saying that he understands this is an issue that needs to be dealt with. Here is an opportunity to make sure that something can happen and happen quickly. You can iron out the details. You as the government can decide what figure you want to put on it. This amendment says that the parliament requires it to happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I appeal to the Labor Party. They've been quite vocal on this issue as well. Let's make sure something actually happens. Let's make sure that the government is required to deliver a package—not just have the Prime Minister make promises when he's getting a few tough questions on his favourite radio show. Let's make sure that this parliament requires the government to do something for the arts and entertainment sector. Up to this point it has been all hollow promises and nothing has come down the line. It has been over a week and still there is nothing from this government. It has been three months, and the industry is in a worse situation. Hundreds of thousands of Australians are unemployed because this government didn't act when it should have. Hundreds of thousands of Australians will remain out of work if we don't get something done today. I appeal to both sides to pass these amendments and to get on with supporting the arts and entertainment sector across Australia.</span>

We believe that they are inappropriate amendments to this bill. Senator Hanson-Young, you're right; the Prime Minister and the minister for the arts have already confirmed that the government is looking at the issues impacting the arts, screen and entertainment sectors. In addition, a substantial number of organisations within the arts community are benefiting from the JobKeeper program. For example, I understand that Queensland Ballet, the Melbourne Theatre Company, the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and Opera Australia are all benefiting from the JobKeeper program. I'm also advised that the total support received for the initial JobKeeper fortnights in April by the creative and performing arts under the cash flow boosts and JobKeeper initiatives was around $99.6 million. We've also committed to a $27 million targeted support package for areas of the arts industry identified as being most affected by COVID-19, with dedicated financial support for Indigenous visual art centres and art fairs, regional arts and live music, and the performance industry.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:34</span>):  It is extremely disappointing, frankly surprising and, I suspect, for many people in the arts and entertainment industries, insulting to hear the minister describe the economic crisis being experienced by the arts and entertainment sector as a 'hobbyhorse'. That's certainly not the experience of the people whom I've been talking to, and I'm frankly shocked that you would describe it in those terms. This is an industry that has been shut down by the government and then abandoned. First, the government tried to pretend that the JobKeeper and the jobseeker packages were arts packages, which they plainly were not. Then it gave $27 million to select parts of the sector, which was welcome but nowhere near enough. Now it is talking about a relief package, but to date there is absolutely nothing to be seen, and those in the arts and entertainment sector could be forgiven for feeling that this government doesn't care about them and, in fact, holds them to contempt, as evidenced this morning by the description of this issue as a 'hobbyhorse'. How disgusting!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These people are workers, and they are absolutely vital to the beating heart of our nation. They need your help now, and it's only the government that can actually deliver it because it is the government that, at the moment, unfortunately, occupies the Treasury benches. It holds the purse strings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will be opposing this amendment. It's regrettable, but the truth is that the only way we can get action is for this government to act—this government that considers this issue a hobbyhorse. These amendments purport to create what is described as an arts and entertainment industry coronavirus recovery fund, but the sad truth is that they create an appropriation with no dollar value. As much as the Greens might try to convince us otherwise, and I commend their sincerity in this regard, the only way to deliver a much-needed funding boost to the arts and entertainment sector is for the government to move. The Prime Minister, Mr Morrison, and the Minister for Communications, Cyber Safety and the Arts, the missing Mr Fletcher, have been repeatedly found wanting. People cannot wait any longer.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I make clear from the beginning that Labor supports this legislation and hopes the government seeks to pass it through parliament expeditiously. This was a commitment I as the responsible shadow minister gave at the Law Council of Australia Immigration Law Conference on 6 March 2020.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They say a week is a long time in politics, so imagine how long six years feels by comparison. It's been six long years since the recommendations in this bill were first put forward. It's been six long years for lawyers who provide migration advice to have been operating under a scheme of dual registration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The aim of this bill is to improve the effectiveness of the regulatory scheme governing migration agents. It contains measures stemming from the recommendations of the 2014 Independent Review of the Office of the Migration Agents Registration Authority, otherwise known as the OMARA review. In fact, Tony Abbott was Prime Minister when these recommendations were made. The current Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, was the immigration minister who received the OMARA review. I must give some credit to the government. They did introduce this bill into the last parliament in June 2017. It managed to get introduced into the Senate in May 2018. The Senate even debated that bill for a short amount of time in December 2018. Then, despite bipartisan support, that's where the legislation stopped. The bill sat on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> for 211 days—a simple, straightforward bill which Labor has supported and recommendations that the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government has failed to make law for six long years. Even government senators recommended 'the Senate pass the bills without delay', in the report from the Senate Standing Committees on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. After six years, multiple reviews, many sitting weeks and three prime ministers, this bill is finally before the Senate. Let's understand here that this bill will make changes to how migration agents are registered—that is, specifically to how lawyers are registered—</span>

                  </a>  Consistent with the government's position on formal motions, which I outlined to the chamber yesterday, when we get to motion No. 646 I flag that the government will seek to have it dealt with during general motions rather than formal motions. That is because it raises complex policy matters on which all senators should have an appropriate opportunity to explain their position in an appropriately detailed and nuanced fashion. This session on formal motions is not the right place for detailed debate of complex issues.</span>

We have had concerns for some time that this part of the program is being used to move motions that contain content that warrants further debate and that can't be dealt with as a yes/no situation. It is being used to wedge political opponents in a way that doesn't allow for fulsome debate. We believe that this part of the program needs to be reformed because of the way this part of the program is being used by senators.</span>

                  </a>  We of course take a very different position to One Nation on the issue of Black Lives Matter and Indigenous deaths in custody, as I'm sure people well know. But we are particularly concerned that the government, with the apparent support of the opposition, is now the sole arbiter of what is going to be allowed to be discussed in motions. In our view, this is an infringement on the power of the Senate to determine its own agenda and, in particular, for smaller parties to put issues that are a bit inconvenient for the two big parties to deal with.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, whilst we would have opposed the motion, were it being put, we are again concerned, as we were yesterday, that this is a trend of the government, silencing any party in this Senate from putting motions on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>.</span>

                  </a>  Just to the argument that it can be debated at another time: we know that, but the instances of those times are far reduced. We have formal motions every day. General business and the ability of the crossbench, in particular, to get time in that session is vastly limited. So this is in effect a silencing, and it's that issue that we take issue with.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">The PRESIDENT:</span>  I will just correct, for the record, what the operation of this section of business is. Any senator can deny an issue formality. It is not a party or status; it is in the hands of 76 senators to deny formality— a matter to be considered without debate. It is important to note that granting a motion formality means it is not debated; it is voted on by the Senate specifically without debate. The right of every senator to deny that formality is an ability for them to say, 'I do not want to vote on this without debate.' That's just the operation; it's in the hands of the Senate as to whether that changes. But it's important that each senator understands the operation of that provision of the day's program.</span>

                  </a>  The New Acland Coal Mine has in fact been actively opposed by local farmers, who are rightly terrified about the impacts on their water supply, the productivity of prime farmland and the health of local communities. Some friend of the farmer this government is! The motion accuses these concerned landowners of lawfare, but it ignores the fact that Australia's highest court has agreed there are serious issues to be heard. Of course this government supports extending a coalmine in the climate crisis after the fires that we just had, because they're blinded by the donations from the coal and gas industry—from this coalmine proponent in particular, that's at least $700,000. It's about time they listened to what the community is saying: no new coalmines; protect farmland; act in the public interest; and create real jobs for people in regional areas by investing in renewable energy, tourism and sustainable manufacturing. </span>

                  </a>  Domestic, family and sexual violence is a scourge and its impact is horrific. All levels of governments, sectors, industries, communities, families and individuals can contribute to changing the statistics related to domestic violence. In March the Commonwealth government moved swiftly to commit $150 million for the COVID-19 domestic and family violence support package. This funding is on top of the $340 million the Commonwealth had already invested in initiatives under the Fourth Action Plan of the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children. While some family and domestic violence services have seen increased demand since the pandemic began, trends across Australian jurisdictions and different service types have been variable. We're now working with the new COAG Women's Safety Council to collectively address the important issues.</span>

Women are on the frontlines making up the majority of employees in essential services like health care and education. The government is closely monitoring the economic effects from the coronavirus on all Australians, including women, noting that the full effects remain uncertain.

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I have long advocated for greater financial transparency within the aged care sector - it has been a long time coming - but that time is now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">People were shocked by the extent of the abuse and poor care exposed in the interim report by the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety. It was a scathing report and an indictment on an industry that is meant to deliver respectful, good-quality care during an aged person's final years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The interim report showed that the government has deep systemic work to do to fix the aged-care system. It also needs to increase its investment. But it cannot simply pour money into the system without asking for a more accountable and transparent situation from providers. It is the <span style="font-style:italic;">quid pro quo </span>aged care providers must deliver, given that they are underpinned by significant federal subsidies. In 2018–19, governments spent over $20 billion on aged care, with the majority—approximately 66 per cent of this—for residential aged care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">On the last day of sitting in 2019 I moved an amendment for greater financial transparency in the aged sector to the Government's the Aged Care Legislation Amendment (New Commissioner Functions) Bill 2019 that would have required residential aged care providers to give annual financial statements to the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commissioner, who would then make them public.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Regrettably, One Nation leader, Senator Pauline Hanson, and the Federal Government colluded, after they were heavily lobbied by some aged care providers, to block that game-changing amendment. This amendment would have forced aged care providers to reveal how much they actually spend on food, staff, and other costs of delivering care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It was an important opportunity missed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Sadly, it showed just how strong the ties that bind the aged care lobby and government really are. It was a deplorable act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The aged care industry has been successfully lobbying governments for years arguing against more transparency. The influence of the industry through government committees, thinktanks and policies is well known and is being rightly questioned at the royal commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It was also an odd choice for Senator Pauline Hanson, who has previously rallied against the aged care sector for "rorting and malpractice".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Consequently, I have brought that amendment back and finessed it into this private senator's bill - the Aged Care Legislation Amendment (Financial Transparency) Bill 2020 which requires aged care providers to disclose their income, their spend on food and medication, the amount spent on staff and staff training, accommodation, administration, and how much they pay out to their parent bodies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This will enable families of loves ones, stakeholders and the public to have a clear view – for the first time - on the proportion of income those providers actually spend on costs of care and how much is being pocketed or wasted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is a simple bill that provides crucial information in the public interest. It has the potential to be game changer in the aged care space. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Providers might object to the administrative 'burden' of having to provide annual financial statements but, frankly, that is a paltry concern when weighed against the vast public benefits transparency will delivered, should this bill pass.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety has got financial transparency squarely on its agenda.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In its "<span style="font-style:italic;">Background Paper 1: Navigating the Maze: An Overview of Australia</span><span style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s Current Aged Care System</span>", the Royal Commission provided an overview of aged care funding models and summarised who pays for what. Then, in its Interim Report, the Royal Commission criticised the aged care system for failing to publish sufficiently specific financial information, saying "there is <span style="font-style:italic;">no</span> public information on the way providers use taxpayers' funds and individuals' contributions to deliver aged care services."</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That must change, but we do not need to wait for the Royal Commission's final report and the consequent delays in dealing with the pandemic crisis forcing the suspension of hearings and workshops and the extension of submission - we must act now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Organisations are transparent when they enable others to see and understand how they operate in an honest way. This must apply to the aged care sector – they should not be exempt in any way. This Bill will ensure that goal is achieved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill does not require private information (such as client records) and 'commercial in confidence' material (such as tender submissions) to be made public. It is primarily concerned with how monies are spent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Unlike hospital and child care centres, aged care facilities can employ as few staff as they like because there are no staff-to-resident ratios in nursing homes. We don't know how much they spend on staff, or what categories of staff they spend their money on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">When it comes to food, a study of 800 nursing homes shows the average spend is just $6 a day.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) Q&amp;A program "Spotlight on Aged Care" recently highlighted the issue of financial transparency in aged care. Panel member Sarah Holland-Batt, who gave evidence on the abuse and neglect of her father to the Royal Commission, told the audience:</span>
                </p>

                    <span style="font-style:italic;">s just been lost in this discussion about funding is the transparency about where exactly it</span>

                    <span style="font-style:italic;">s going … we</span>

                    <span style="font-style:italic;">ll be spending $20 billion on aged care funding, which is a lot of money when you consider there are around 200,000 people in residential care, and then people with Home Care Packages …</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />
                    <span style="font-style:italic;">We also know that with aged care funding, with residential aged care funding, that, yes, some providers are struggling. But other providers are paying out gigantic dividends and making huge profits for their shareholders when they</span>
                    <span style="font-style:italic;">'</span>
                    <span style="font-style:italic;">re primarily being funded with Commonwealth government funding.</span>

                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />
                    <span style="font-style:italic;">So, I really think that, in order to be given these cheques for more taxpayer funds, we need radical transparency about where this money is going.</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Ms Holland-Batt's comments raise important points and demonstrate that financial transparency is an issue of grave concern to the public.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I could not agree with her more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under the Bill approved providers will have to provide annual financial statements to the Quality and Safety Commission, which will then make them public. The financial statements will detail the amount spent on the provision of care—things like food and medication—as well as the amount spent on staff and staff training, accommodation, administration and the amounts paid out to parent bodies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the moment, there is no clear way to know how much a provider is spending on the provision of care. Is it 30 per cent of their income? Is it 50 per cent or 70 per cent? We just do not know how much a provider is pocketing as profit at the expense of the people in their care. Currently, providers can spend their taxpayer subsidies pretty much as they choose. But, in an environment where our elderly are being subjected to systemic neglect, they very much must be held to account.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">My office has heard firsthand accounts from people who work with and for aged-care providers highlighting that dodgy financial decisions and profiteering takes place. For instance, there is a hundred-bed provider that has made $2.5 million in profit three years running, but this profit is only shown as $500,000 on its financials, because they pay $2 million in rent to the parent company which already owns the building and there is a 50-bed not-for-profit facility where the salaries for three managers exceeded $500,000 at a time when the home could not meet basic minimum standards and was also, as it turns out, sanctioned. And there are other providers using subsidies to help send senior staff to overseas award ceremonies and lavish conferences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This amendment has the support of the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation, whose members are at the coalface and I thank them for their input into the bill. They and many other stakeholders want financial transparency so that it is finally clear how much facilities actually spend on delivering care and how much is pocketed or wasted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In an ABC story about the royal commission's Hobart hearing which emphasised why these amendments are needed. That story detailed how Bupa South Hobart was so understaffed that, according to the daughter of two residents, her 90-year-old mother had been forced to clean up after her incontinent father and at times help a blind elderly resident go to the toilet because the woman's calls for help had gone unanswered. According to the ABC story, a former Bupa regional director said there was pressure on the facility to spend less on staffing. Part of her responsibility was to 'improve the commercial operation in South Hobart'. In other words, her job was to increase profits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This should outrage us all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">My bill is all about transparency and accountability – we expect this of our politicians and we must expect it from our publicly funded services especially in the aged care sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Knowledge is power, as they say. The bill seeks factual information from providers so we will have a clearer picture of how their facilities are resourced. This will be crucial if we are to engage in sustainable reforms to the sector that will improve the experience and treatment of vulnerable elderly people living in residential aged care. </span>

                  </a>  Of course the Greens support the Australian Public Service and this motion. We support removing the harmful staffing cap and, while this motion doesn't cover it, we also despair at the creeping privatisation of the Public Service through the billions of dollars in contracts that have been gifted by this government to the four big consulting firms who regularly donate to the Liberal Party. But what we most wanted to put on record is that public servants have literally saved Australian lives on multiple occasions so far in 2020, from the weather forecasting of the Bureau of Meterology to the ABC bringing the warnings of fire and COVID into our homes to our public health officials providing best advice to politicians and local communities alike. Throughout a harrowing year, the Australian people have again relied on Public Service workers for support and action. We owe public servants a great deal, and the Greens ask the government to reflect on the importance of strong public institutions as they prepare the October budget.</span>

                  </a>  This motion falsely asserts that there is an arbitrary staff cap for Commonwealth agencies. In fact, staff settings for individual Commonwealth agencies are neither arbitrary nor fixed. Staffing levels vary according to need. There have been few years that have seen greater staff movements than 2020 as staff have been reallocated between agencies and new and temporary staff have been hired to address pressures arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. Staffing levels reflect the impact of decisions by government over time and of relevant external demand pressures from time to time. The Morrison government will continue to use all appropriate government and non-government human resources to support its health and economic response to COVID-19 and to provide valued and essential services to the community.</span>

Over 70 per cent of families are paying less than $5 an hour and nearly a quarter pay less than $2 per hour.

                  </a>  The construction industry estimates that due to the COVID-19 outbreak their pipeline of work will dry up in approximately late August, putting 500,000 jobs in the residential construction industry at risk. HomeBuilder will keep this pipeline flowing in the second half of 2020 to keep tradies in jobs. The government invests over $6 billion every year in housing assistance and the government has provided community housing providers with unprecedented support through the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation's Affordable Housing Bond Aggregator. This alone has supported the delivery of more than 1,500 new social and affordable dwellings and 5,000 existing dwellings.</span>

                  </a>  There are elements of this motion which we would, I think, were the time allowed to debate it, support. But section (b) is a particular problem; it's calling for a direction of funds and the scrapping of the HomeBuilder scheme. We think we're not in a position to argue for that, and we certainly agree that there should be more done around social housing, but this motion is drafted in a way that Labor can't support. We've had a very strong record in government of supporting and investing in social housing. In fact, when the stimulus package was put together in the last global financial crisis, a social housing package, supported by Labor, was worth about $7 billion, so I don't think there can be criticism of our support for social housing. But the way this motion has been drafted doesn't allow for proper debate and, as such, we will be opposing it.</span>

                  </a>  The Greens oppose this motion. The live animal export trade is an industry built on cruelty and on so-called standards that guarantee the horrific cruelty and death of thousands of animals. At the moment there isn't even a semblance of oversight on these ships of misery, as independent observers have been taken off the ships because of COVID-19. There's not one bad apple; the whole barrel is rotten. Misery and cruelty are inherent in live animal exports, and the industry has shown time and again that it is incapable of reform. The Liberal-Nationals government continues to ignore the overwhelming community demands to ban live export. The only way to end this cruelty is to shut it down.</span>

                  </a>  The Nationals strongly support the live cattle industry, because they support a strong agricultural industry in northern Australian and thousands of jobs, including for Indigenous Australians. We fought for the industry when the Labor government recklessly banned the trade overnight without proper consideration of its impacts. That is why Nationals senators have welcomed the Federal Court decision to provide compensation for those hurt by Labor's reckless decisions. We have called on the government not to appeal this decision so that after nearly a decade of pain some relief can be given. We note that the government has made no decision on the appeal, and the Attorney-General will attend the Nationals party room next week to further discussions on these matters.</span>

Nationals senators who have put forward this motion should heed the words of their leader to ensure that the live export industry continues to be a world leader with regard to animal welfare and continues to operate on a sustainable basis—meaning that, as new scientific evidence comes to the attention of the live animal export regulator, governments make decisions that ensure the welfare of the animals, as did the former agriculture minister, Senator McKenzie, and the current agriculture minister, Minister Littleproud, who supported the moratorium on live sheep to the Middle East during the northern summer trade from 1 June to mid-September.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:50</span>):  The ALP's position on the Health Insurance Amendment (General Practitioners and Quality Assurance) Bill 2020 is that GPs are eligible for higher Medicare rebates if they are fellows of the GP colleges and meet the ongoing continuing professional development requirements. The current system for determining eligibility for those higher rebates is administered by Services Australia and duplicates the separate requirements of the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme. This bill removes the requirement for eligible GPs to register with Services Australia and instead ties eligibility for higher Medicare rebates to the existing scheme. This is a sensible change and Labor will support this bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DUNIAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Forestry and Fisheries and Assistant Minister for Regional Tourism</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:50</span>):  It's a pleasure to speak on this, the Health Insurance Amendment (General Practitioners and Quality Assurance) Bill 2020, and indeed I do thank Senator Kitching and the opposition for their contribution to debate on this. In summing up debate, I'd like to start by saying that the bill simplifies Medicare administrative processes for recognition as a specialist general practitioner, or a GP, for Medicare purposes under the Health Insurance Act 1973 and will align Medicare eligibility for GPs with the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme, NRAS, and the requirements therein.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NRAS commenced in 2010 and, for the first time, provided a nationally consistent process of regulation for 16 health professions, including GPs. The NRAS established the Medical Board of Australia, the MBA, which is responsible for standards for the medical profession, including specialist registration and, of course, setting standards for mandatory continuing professional development, CPD. The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency, AHPRA, provides operational support for the MBA and holds the most up-to-date and accurate data source for the registration status of general practitioners. Services Australia will automatically update GPs' Medicare access, based on regular data provided by AHPRA, and this will simplify processes for GPs with their Medicare recognition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also update the definition of 'general practitioner' in the Health Insurance Act 1973 to align with the national registration arrangements. Transitional and grandfathering provisions to be made in the Health Insurance Regulations 2018 will also ensure that medical practitioners who are currently eligible for these higher GP rebates, will continue to maintain this eligibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, the RACGP, and the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine, ACRRM, are the professional bodies for general practice and, together with the MBA, are responsible for ensuring quality in general practice across the country. Every three years, the RACGP and ACRRM advise Services Australia that GPs are compliant with CPD requirements to maintain patient access to higher Medicare rebates. This amendment will remove this duplicative reporting of CPD to Medicare. Extensive consultation with the RACGP and ACRRM, the Australian Medical Association, AHPRA and the MBA, has involved careful consideration to ensure currently eligible medical practitioners who are practising as GPs will continue to be eligible for higher rebates with minimal administrative requirements to be completed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 of this bill removes references to repealed legislation and replaces it with reference to the Federal Financial Relations Act 2009. The bill will also ensure that activities declared on or after 1 July 2009 are taken to have been valid declarations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to report that key stakeholders have been consulted as part of the drafting of the bill and support these streamlined processes. I'd like to extend my thanks to the professional groups, many of which have already been mentioned, who engaged with the proposals in this bill. I thank senators once again for their contribution and commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="LNW" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KENEALLY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:55</span>):  I seek to continue my remarks on this bill. Let's understand here that this bill will make changes to how migration agents are registered, specifically to how lawyers are registered as migration agents. The main purpose is to implement the recommendation of the 2014 review of the MARA, which recommended the removal of lawyers from the Migration Agents Registration Authority scheme. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill amends the Migration Act 1958 to remove the requirement for lawyers who hold practising certificates from registering as migration agents when providing immigration advice to their clients. This will be achieved by removing them from the regulatory scheme that governs migration agents. Lawyers will not go unchecked, however. Those who choose to provide migration advice will still be entirely regulated comprehensively by their own state and territory legal professional bodies when providing said advice. I hope that when this bill becomes law it will allow more lawyers to perform pro bono migration work for some people who need legal representation more than most in our society, including asylum seekers. Quality, fair and efficient legal representation is one of the pillars of our justice system and it should be treated with equal regard when it comes to migration law. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have also been some minor and technical changes to this revised bill since its first iteration. This includes updating the academic and vocational requirements for applicants to be registered with the MARA; to complete the graduate diploma and Capstone assessment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No fewer than six ministers or assistant ministers have had carriage of this legislation, including Senator Reynolds in her former role as the Assistant Minister for Home Affairs. However, the delay in abolishing the dual regulation of immigration lawyers rests squarely at the feet of the Minister for Home Affairs, Peter Dutton. As much as the Minister for Home Affairs avoids discussing the migration aspects of his responsibilities, he is the senior minister when it comes to the Department of Home Affairs. While there may be an acting immigration minister at present, Minister Tudge, Minister Dutton is ultimately responsible for the department, its actions and legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It should come as no surprise that there were eight pieces of migration legislation the Minister for Home Affairs failed to pass in the last parliament. They sat on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> for an accumulative 3,749 days. The current government has been in power for the past seven years and they are responsible for the administration of, as well as any amendments to, Australia's migration law. Their failures go to the heart of migration law in this country and how the failures of the current government impact the lives of real people. Even the supposed plans the government so enthusiastically spruiked, such as their plan to encourage regional migration, are in disarray—and they were in disarray before the COVID-19 pandemic. The government heralded the Designated Area Migration Agreements, otherwise known as DAMAs, as a solution for Australia's regional migration woes but, as of 31 December last year, prior to the pandemic, only two visas in the entire country had been granted under the government's new agreements—two visas, across six agreements. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have a government and a minister willing to ignore the symptoms that are presenting themselves when it comes to the abysmal health of Australia's migration system. Since I became the shadow minister for home affairs, I've sought to challenge the current minister's track record. And, while talking points may be a strength of Mr Dutton, his ability to oversee the Department of Home Affairs and his inability to arrest the emerging problems show how this department is plagued with his incompetence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The health of Australia's migration system is dire. As of 31 March, there were over 281,000 people on bridging visas in Australia, the majority of whom would be waiting for the Department of Home Affairs to process their substantive visa applications. This has more than doubled since Labor left office in 2013. The processing time for 90 per cent of partner visas is currently at an astonishing 28 months. That's 2½ years Australian citizens are waiting to progress in their lives with their partners, their husbands and their wives. There are more than 180,000 people in that position—over 90,000 Australians and 90,000 of their prospective partners in a state of migration limbo. There are over 62,000 visa overstayers in Australia, and I doubt Mr Dutton knows where all of these non-citizens are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these migration matters are only complicated further by the caseload of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. As of 31 May there were close to 64,000 cases before the migration and refugee tribunal of the AAT. Case dates are currently being listed for 2022. The ever-growing backlog is not going to improve with ignorance or incompetence. These symptoms affect real people. They affect Australians. They affect the fabric of our society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Dutton is a minister with no plan for his department or the major issues facing Australia. You used to be able to trust this government to manage Australia's borders but, sadly, that is not the case anymore. Let's not forget Operation Sovereign Borders has bipartisan support, but, as the airplane people blowout shows, you cannot trust this government with our borders anymore.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not forget Minister Dutton is the minister who lost control of the borders. We witnessed the explosion of airplane arrivals in Australia claiming asylum—people being trafficked to Australia on tourist visas in record numbers then made to apply for asylum. This minister, Peter Dutton, and the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, failed to notice when the people smugglers changed their business model from boats to planes. You simply can't trust this government anymore when it comes to borders. I notice the silence now emanating from the other side.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the fact that this bill has been an idea for six years you wonder when the minister will take some action to disrupt the people-smuggling operations trafficking migrants through our airports in record numbers—</span>

                    </a>  To those senators on the other side, it's not a funny subject. It shouldn't be a funny subject, but yet they find it amusing. Let me say this: there is nothing wrong with claiming asylum. It's an important right. But 90 per cent of applications, such as these, are eventually found to be without merit. Even the assistant minister, Jason Wood, warned of his own government's failures last February on this crisis, which is occurring on Minister Dutton's watch, and still Minister Dutton has not acted. It's no surprise, when you think about how long it's taken to simply pass this legislation, Minister Peter Dutton doesn't have a plan to deal with the record number of asylum claims occurring on his watch, with the blowout in processing time for partner visas and with the record number of people on bridging visas. And he has no intention to address the further exploitation and slavery-like conditions these trafficked people are experiencing here on Australian soil.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, of course, there is the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruby Princess</span>, the largest outbreak of coronavirus in Australia. Mr Dutton failed to stop the one boat that mattered. Let's not forget 850 cases of coronavirus and over 30 tragic deaths, 10 per cent of all cases in Australia. The outbreak in north-west Tasmania is all linked to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruby Princess</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While state health authorities have responsibility under the federal Biosecurity Act, when it comes to Australia's migration program and our borders the buck is supposed to stop with the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton. Let's not forget it was the Prime Minister who stood up and said he was going to put arriving cruise ships under the direct command of the Australian Border Force. Four days after the Prime Minister said that, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruby Princess</span> came into port and let everyone out, spreading—</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator KENEALLY:</span>
                    </a>  I note the interjections on the other side. Suddenly they're a bit more sensitive about border security. They don't particularly care about the slavery-like conditions of the people who have been trafficked here through their airports and made to apply for asylum, but, when you talk about boats and their failure to deal with the one boat that mattered, they suddenly get sensitive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So here we are. They know what the Australian people now know, which is that you can't trust this government anymore when it comes to our borders, so I will always hold this government to account when it comes to the Home Affairs portfolio and the Migration Act. Labor will work with the government to support sensible reforms, as we are doing today—sensible reforms that took them only six years to bring into the parliament! We're glad this legislation is finally before the Senate. It took only six years and three prime ministers, but here we are, finally, today. And I am pleased to tell you, Madam Deputy Acting Speaker, that Labor will support this sensible, overdue, long-awaited reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Maybe now the Minister for Home Affairs could get on and deal with the excessive backlog of partner visas and bridging visas, with the backlog at the AAT, with the fact that the Department of Home Affairs ranks 93 out of 93 departments when it comes to morale and with the fact that a third of the people who work in Home Affairs would rather work somewhere else. Maybe he could get on with the Future Maritime Surveillance Capability project. I mean, it took only six years to do this simple piece of legislation! Maybe now that he's cleared this big project off his plate, he could get on and deal with some of the substantive issues that are plaguing the Department of Home Affairs. And I haven't even mentioned the Paladin cost blowout and the massive waste of taxpayer dollars there. Given that the Minister for Home Affairs has finally managed to get this substantive piece of legislation off his desk after six years, maybe he could just get on and deal with some of the bigger, more pressing problems that are facing real Australians in our community and could clear up some of the backlogs in his own portfolio. Incompetence is not an excuse for his maladministration.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKIM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:07</span>):  I had to look a couple of times to make sure we were actually on the Migration Amendment (Regulation of Migration Agents) Bill, but I'm glad the Senate has shown Senator Keneally some latitude, and I'll take advantage of that to make a couple of comments in response to some of the things that she said. But, before I do, I will just directly address the legislation before us, which is, of course, similar to bills of the same name tabled in 2017 and amended in 2018, though with a redrafting of schedule 4 of the regulation of migration agents bill and minor amendments to definitions in the rates of charge bill. It's worth noting that both the 2017 and 2019 bills were referred to and reported on by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, it's unlawful to provide immigration advice without being registered as a migration agent with the Office of the Migration Agents Registration Authority, or OMARA. These bills, however, seek to change that, driven by an argument that lawyers, regardless of their professional or educational background, do not need to be regulated alongside specialist migration agents because their skills in existing consumer protections are comparable. The Greens do not believe this argument has merit and will not be supporting these bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whereas postgraduate study to become a migration agent includes four migration law subjects, most undergraduate law degrees do not include any study whatsoever of migration law. Yet, with these bills, any and all lawyers will be able to practise migration law solely because they hold a legal practice certificate. The government is therefore suggesting a registered migration agent who has successfully completed a postgraduate migration agent course is no better equipped to advise on migration law than a lawyer, who may not have studied any specific migration law subjects whatsoever.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under these bills, lawyers practising migration law will no longer be required to subscribe to LEGENDcom, an electronic Home Affairs database of migration and citizenship legislation and policy documents that is continually updated as migration legislation—which is, as all senators would recognise, very fluid—changes. Registration of lawyers by OMARA ensures lawyers comply with a Migration Agents Registration Authority, or MARA, Code of Conduct, which requires practitioners to maintain relevant, specialist and up-to-date knowledge of migration law and processes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current system of registration of migration agents includes robust complaints mechanisms and codes of conduct, which, when complaints are lodged, set in motion thorough investigations. These processes are customer focused to ensure the rights and needs of customers are paramount and are protected. This is a particularly valuable safety net for vulnerable customers. The inclusion of lawyers in the migration regulation scheme is similar to the case of an accountant who must undergo further studies if they want to be registered as a tax agent. To practise patents law, a lawyer must undertake further studies in the area before they are allowed to appear in a matter, so it is not an oddity that lawyers should be required to demonstrate some migration law expertise or be required to keep up to date with migration law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of particular concern to the Greens and many in the industry is the provision of migration services to vulnerable people. In its submission to the Senate inquiry into the 2019 bills, the Migration Institute of Australia noted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Those who oppose dual regulation claim that the legal profession has sufficient complaint and disciplinary mechanisms to deal with professional incompetence or malfeasance. However, some law societies do not appear to have the same regard for migrant consumer protection as the OMARA. Lawyers have been allowed to continue practicing by their law societies, even after being banned by the OMARA for providing fraudulent migration advice or breaches of fiduciary duties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, there are legitimate concerns that these bills will lead to a loss of legal expertise or legal aid funded services in large non-legal migration agencies, including refugee services, because lawyers would seek employment elsewhere. In its submission to the Senate inquiry into the 2017 bills, the Migration Institute of Australia warned, in relation to the humanitarian migration sector:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The removal of lawyers from the regulatory system will result in disastrous, unintended consequences for this sector. It is crucially important that it be protected for both consumers and the large numbers of altruistic lawyers working in this sector. If removed from the OMARA regulatory system these lawyers:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">will be barred from registering as migration agents and then be unable to provide migration advice and assistance within these non-legal practices, and</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">will need to leave these organisations to seek employment in legal practices if they wish to practice as lawyers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This will have dire and wicked knock-on effects for service providers, many of them publicly funded; for early career lawyers wanting to specialise in migration but no longer able to provide advice under the OMARA regulatory system as registered migration agents in non-legal migration practices; and, most importantly, for clients.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Migration Institute of Australia has further warned that if lawyers are removed from the regulatory system the migration advice profession will be opened up to lawyers who are currently sanctioned or banned by OMARA but who will continue to be allowed to practise by their relevant law societies; lawyers who have no knowledge of Australia's complex migration legislation and policy; lawyers who are not compelled to maintain currency of knowledge and professional resources pertaining to this area of law, as required by OMARA registration; and lawyers who choose to practise immigration assistance to supplement their struggling legal practices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For these reasons, the Australian Greens agree with the Migration Institute of Australia's conclusion:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Much of the emphasis in support of removing lawyers from the regulatory system relies on concerns harboured by the impacts on lawyers, with apparent disregard for the impact on consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens believe that consumer protection needs to be the uppermost consideration in this legislation to protect people who are vulnerable to those who would take fees to provide advice and services in areas that they do not have sound knowledge or practice in. For many vulnerable consumers, the difference between good and bad advice and services can be devastating, and life changing, with bad advice and service potentially leading to financial ruin and/or being banned from this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lawyers could have remained within the regulatory system by being exempted from paying the duplicate registration fee and insurance. They could have been required to undertake studies in migration law practice and procedure and been required to maintain continuing professional development in migration law. But the government, for whatever reason, has chosen not to pursue this option and has instead decided to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Currently, lawyers make up just over 30 per cent of all registered migration agents. What these bills will effectively do is carve out nearly one-third of all practising migration agents from the codes of conduct and complaints and disciplinary mechanisms that MARA provides and upholds. But, if this is the path the government and Labor insist on going down, the Greens will try to ensure there is at least some level of accountability in this deregulation of lawyers working as migration agents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In its report entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Annual review of regulatory burdens on business: business and consumer services</span>, the Productivity Commission recommended that, if dual regulation of lawyers should cease, an independent review of the performance of these immigration lawyers and the legal profession complaints handling and disciplinary procedures with respect to their activities should be conducted three years after an exemption becomes effective. That is why the Greens will move an amendment to this legislation—to legislate that review into the regulation of migration agents bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Keneally has again used an opportunity today to prosecute an argument that she's been prosecuting for a long period of time around so-called airplane people. This is a deeply concerning argument and represents a political attempt by Senator Keneally and the Labor Party to outflank a fascist from the right. They will find it impossible to outflank Minister Dutton on migration issues from the right. They will find it absolutely impossible. But that is, unfortunately, not preventing Senator Keneally from attempting that political manoeuvre and, in doing so, going down a very dangerous path.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to put on the record today why the Australian Greens believe it is a dangerous path. Firstly, describing people who come to this country to seek asylum in line with the obligations to which Australia signed up when we signed the protocol to the refugee convention as 'airplane people' uses language perfected by people like Prime Minister Morrison, Minister Dutton and Senator Hanson. It is language deliberately designed to dehumanise and demonise people who seek asylum, and it strongly implies that we in this country have something to fear from migrants and people seeking asylum, when, in fact, we don't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, if people have a valid claim for asylum in Australia, they should be allowed to make it. Minister Dutton might not like it and, for all I know, the Australian Labor Party might not like it. But, regardless of whether they like it or not, we are still a signatory to the refugee convention, despite the last 20 years of bipartisan cruelty to people seeking asylum from the major parties in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, and most dangerously, egging on Minister Dutton and Prime Minister Morrison to crack down further on people seeking asylum could have disastrous consequences and could ultimately cost yet more people their lives. Let's face it: the Australian Labor Party were the architects of the most recent iteration of offshore detention when in 2013 Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said, 'If you arrive here by boat without a valid visa, you will never be allowed into the country.' Let's face it: this iteration of offshore detention has already cost multiple people their lives and has destroyed the lives of hundreds and potentially thousands of other people. It shouldn't need saying to Senator Keneally or the Australian Labor Party, but Minister Dutton and Prime Minister Morrison do not need further encouragement to ruin and destroy the lives of people seeking asylum. They don't need further encouragement to do that, but that is what Senator Keneally is doing by trying to outflank them from the right on this issue. I beg Senator Keneally to reconsider this approach that she has taken and to join the Greens in our campaign for an immigration system with compassion, decency and respect for international law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said yesterday, this latest iteration of offshore detention is a dark, foul and bloody stain on our country's history, and it's got to stop. I ask the government: when are you going to accept the offer from New Zealand? There are still people in Papua New Guinea and there are still people on Nauru. It has now been nearly seven years since July 2013. We'll be moving some motions in this Senate in due course to reflect that awful anniversary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have a solution staring them in the face. It's a kind and generous offer from the New Zealand Prime Minister, Ms Ardern, to take 150 of these people each and every year into New Zealand and put them on a pathway to citizenship in this country. Of course, that is what Australia should have done because the overwhelming majority of these people have been found to be genuine refugees—that is, their claims for asylum have merit under the refugee convention and they were accepted as refugees; in other words, they had a well-founded fear of persecution in their home country. And by 'persecution' in some cases I mean death. If you are a gay man in Iran, you're probably going to be stoned to death or thrown off a tall building. Yet, what did we do when gay men from Iran asked us for help? We exiled them to Manus Island and we exiled them to Nauru.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Shame on the Labor Party for being the architects of this calamitous scheme and shame on the Liberal Party for running it in the most punitive and disgusting way. I was on Manus Island when the Liberal government ordered the cutting off of drinking water and food to over 650 desperate people. I will never forget that and I will ensure, to the best of my capacity, that the Australian people never forget it either.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:22</span>):  We're debating the Migration Amendment (Regulation of Migration Agents) Bill 2019 and the Migration Agents Registration Application Charge Amendment (Rates of Charge) Bill 2019, but you'd never know that because most of the debate that has happened in this chamber about these bills has been about entirely unrelated matters. Senator McKim at least had the good sense to refer to some bits of the legislation, and I thank him for his contribution in that regard. But, golly, the Labor contribution was nothing short of irrelevant.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk about what this legislation actually does. It really is pretty simple. This government believes that we should impose the lightest possible amount of regulation on people who are in business, professions or anywhere in the Australian community while still ensuring that we have an appropriate amount of consumer protection. That shouldn't be a controversial proposal, yet up until the review that was conducted back in 2014 of the operation of OMARA, the office that regulates migration agents, those legal practitioners—in essence, registered lawyers—who also were registered as migration agents had to comply with two sets of regulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no real advantage to having lawyers who practise in the area of migration registered under two regulatory regimes. They both aim to do the same thing. In many respects the standards that are faced by legal practitioners under state regulation are more rigorous, yet there was a complaint levelled from Senator McKim on behalf of the Australian Greens that this is somehow a drop in standards. No. We're keeping legal practitioners subject to the very high standards that apply to legal practitioners under state regimes. Those penalties for failing to comply with the regimes in place for the regulation of solicitors and legal practitioners under state regimes often involve civil compensation. They involve disciplinary action. They involve criminal action in many cases when the wrong thing has been done by a person seeking representation for migration work. So there's really no compromise in the standard that we're setting for people who want to practise in this area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we are doing something that's really important, something that aligns very well with our values: we are cutting the burden of government regulation. It's got to be an uncontroversial proposition. Why should somebody practising in this area have to comply with two regulation regimes when they could comply with one, noting that it is the one that imposes the higher standard of the two? It seems pretty common sense. Maybe that explains why Senator Keneally talked about everything else under the sun and not the bill—because anyone who'd read the bill would go, 'Well, that's actually pretty sensible.' So, for those people who operate in the industry, those people who will need to adapt to this regime, they might need a little bit more detail about how this is going to work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned that this change comes out of the review of OMARA that was conducted in 2014. The No. 1 recommendation from that was that legal practitioners be removed entirely from the MARA regime—the migration agents regulation program at the Commonwealth level—and be entirely regulated by their state professional bodies. This bill implements that. There's been a lengthy consultation process, though, in between that report and the present time, and that means that stakeholders across the industry that provides migration advice have been engaged with at length. And the government's committed to continuing that engagement, particularly as the industry adapts to this new arrangement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One big benefit that this will provide for people operating in the industry in circumstances where they've got a legal practitioner's practising certificate is that they're not going to have to pay the registration and licensing fees for two systems. At a time when many in business are doing it tough and people in the professions are doing it tough, to make it possible for those practitioners to pay one set of fees instead of two would, I would have thought, have been welcome from all political colours in this chamber. It should be uncontroversial that fewer fees, fewer burdens and fewer encumbrances to people getting ahead in business would be a good thing. But that's what the bill does; it makes it so that those people practising in the industry only have to face the levies, dues and registration fees for one regulatory regime rather than two.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's really important to note, though, that consumer protection hasn't been forgotten. Lawyers who have practising certificates and who intend to practise in the migration advice field still have access to high-quality educational offerings through their professional associations, and they would retain access to the resources that are produced at the Commonwealth level to help make sure we're getting quality advice in the migration field. It is also really important to notice that highly rigorous processes will remain for consumers who have complaints so they are able to get justice. They will be heard, investigations will be conducted and the only difference will be who is doing it. It'll mean that those people who aren't legal practitioners will be investigated by OMARA and those people who are legal practitioners will be investigated by the processes of state and territory law societies. And that's the way all complaints against legal practitioners relating to every other field of advice are handled in the states at present. In many ways it was a little counterintuitive that, just for those who deal with migration advice, complaints were dealt with in a place other than where complaints against a legal practitioner in every other field of law would be investigated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People who are working in the industry, though, might be concerned about the way this bill will affect people who, early in their career, are on restricted practising certificates. For those who aren't in the industry, it's worth noting that when someone becomes a solicitor, a legal practitioner, they're put on a restricted practising certificate, usually for a period of two years. That means an experienced lawyer needs to supervise them in their work to help them adapt the ethical approaches and the good practice management practices—and in many ways the analytical rigour and even the self-care—associated with becoming a great contributor to the profession. But of course when you're in that phase you might, if you were to read this bill at face value, be confused about which regime you'd fall into under this new arrangement. So we've put in provisions to make it very clear. People who are in that early-career phase where they are supervised can remain on application covered by both regimes in that early period, and that will cover them up to the time when they are released from that supervision period. And that's something that can be arranged with OMARA. It's a commonsense, practical solution that deals with the fact that, as a matter of practicality, people are subject to supervision early in their career. It's worth noting, though, that a reference in the bill to people who are subject to restricted practising certificates isn't a reference to people who are subject to supervision for disciplinary or misconduct reasons; that's treated very differently.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Future legal practitioners who have restricted practising certificates will be able to register with OMARA during the two-year eligible period if they've completed the graduate diploma on migration law and practice and the Capstone assessment that was introduced in 2018. Those were brought in to make sure that we are equipping the industry with high-quality practitioners who really know what they're doing and who are well equipped to help often vulnerable people in our community to get the quality advice they need and that we are equipping those practitioners to offer value for money because they really know what they're doing. Future legal practitioners who have not completed those requirements won't be registered with OMARA, but they will still be able to provide immigration assistance in connection with legal practice, and they'll be regulated by their legal professional and disciplinary body.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a measure that's been put in place to make sure that people in that early-career supervision phase don't suffer unfairness or hardship as a consequence of these changes. It really is a transition arrangement. An unrestricted legal practitioner, for those watching at home, is a lawyer who has got through that early phase of supervision in their career. They're allowed to be admitted as a lawyer, they're granted a legal practising certificate, they've completed their supervised practice and they've been granted that right to practice without supervision in their state. Once you've got that, if you're someone who's practising in the migration field, you'll be able to do so simply by following the disciplinary arrangements that are put in place by your state or territory legal professional regulation body.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a great opportunity to sing the praises of those bodies. I am a Queensland legal practitioner, a member of the bar—a proud member of the Queensland Bar Association—and I have been admitted as a solicitor in the past. While no profession is perfect, I can say with great confidence that the professional associations in Queensland invest heavily in the expertise, in the qualifications and in the good judgement and ethics of practitioners at all levels and work really hard to make sure that people who are practising, whether they're at the start of or towards the more senior end of their careers, have access to the kind of guidance they need in order to make good calls on behalf of members of the community who need help. I have great confidence that those professional associations will continue to do the great work that they do in relation to every other area of law and practice for regulating practitioners and making sure that they are ethical and ensuring that consumer complaints are investigated. I have great confidence that they will also do that well in relation to the field of migration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The consequence, I suppose, of passing that responsibility over to the states might seem obvious, but I'll pop it on the record. That is, that the OMARA will no longer be able to investigate any existing complaints concerning Australian legal practitioners who are providing, or who have provided, immigration legal assistance and who are not continuing migration agents of a registered kind or former registered migration agents. People who have lodged those complaints will need to re-lodge them with state and territory law associations, and that means that from this point onwards there will be a separation of who investigates what. That makes sense; we don't need to expend Commonwealth resources on investigating things that will remain within OMARA's remit when we already have resources paid for and invested in by practitioners to be delivered at the state and territory level.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As somebody who is an enthusiastic federalist, it pleases me greatly to see more power and more responsibilities being provided back to the states and being provided back to the local professions, and being provided in a way that is decentralised from the Commonwealth. One of the benefits of doing that is competitive federalism. We get to see how things are done in Queensland and compare that to how it's done in New South Wales. Granted, there is a lot of collaboration between people in different states, but we can compare how things operate in Victoria, WA, South Australia or the Territory and harness the competitive natures of these professions to encourage them to do ever better in their provision of services to clients in our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Federalism offers many benefits, but seeing responsibilities handed back to the states and the state and territory associations, as this bill does, is consistent with those principles of competitive federalism, and it's consistent with our overarching commitment to always reducing the regulatory burden—always reducing the fees and charges that are faced by people in business and the professions—and always making it simpler and easier to go about your work and your life.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  I rise to give a brief contribution on this very important bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government reintroduced a bill package to remove certain legal practitioners from dual regulation by the Office of the Migration Agents Registration Authority, the OMARA, on 27 November 2019. The bill package consists of the Migration Amendment (Regulation of Migration Agents) Bill 2019 and the Migration Agents Registration Application Charge Amendment (Rates of Charge) Bill 2019. The Migration Amendment (Regulation of Migration Agents) Bill 2019 contains measures to implement the recommendations of the 2014 independent review of the OMARA and makes other amendments to improve the effectiveness of the regulatory scheme governing migration agents. The bill removes legal practitioners with unrestricted practising certificates from the OMARA scheme such that legal practitioners will be entirely regulated by their state or territory legal disciplinary bodies. Eligible legal practitioners with restricted practising certificates will still be able to register with the OMARA for two years, which can be extended to four years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill reflects the government's commitment to deregulation by removing the unnecessary administrative burden of dual regulation of lawyers, who are already subject to a strict professional regulatory regime. Legal professional bodies and the statutory schemes underpinning them apply a broader range of powers to resolve consumer related issues, including penalties outside the OMARA's jurisdiction. These penalties include financial penalties for improper conduct and recommending compensation for affected clients.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to note that this bill was subject to extensive consultation with industry and key stakeholders prior to being initially introduced to parliament. It's very important to recognise that there is no evidence that removing any legal practitioners from the migration agents registration scheme would result in any reduced consumer protection. Lawyers who are no longer subject to OMARA's regulatory scheme will remain subject to a strict professional regulatory regime administered by their state or territory disciplinary bodies. I will leave it there.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282728" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McMAHON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  I'm very happy today to rise to speak to both the Migration Amendment (Regulation of Migration Agents) Bill 2019 and the Migration Agents Registration Application Charge Amendment (Rates of Charge) Bill 2019. Those of us on this side of the chamber know a key hallmark of good governance is the delivery of the means by which government structures and processes operate efficiently, not just our internal practices but also those areas where the Australian public must interact with our various departments and services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government made a promise to Australians that it would cut red tape and unnecessary costly duplication, and I commend the government for delivering on this promise. Additionally, these amendments reaffirm this government's broader commitment to deregulation across industry sectors. In my experience, as a veterinarian and small business owner, I have witnessed firsthand the impacts poor governance, overregulation and duplication have on small business. In this instance, we are addressing the convoluted registration practices and mandatory continuing legal education and migration agent compulsory education, and, on top of this, the unnecessary additional costs imposed on sole practitioners and small practices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments for both the migration bills we speak of today are designed to streamline the processes for restricted and unrestricted legal practitioners. Presently Australian lawyers are governed by the strict regulatory rules of each state's law society. Legal practitioners are considered to be either restricted or unrestricted. All legal practitioners are considered restricted within the first two years of admission and must be under the direct supervision and employ of an unrestricted legal practitioner. The restricted practitioner is required to be registered within the law society under the professional indemnity insurance of the practitioner. This structure serves to not only ensure the highest standards of service but also act as a safeguard for both client and lawyer. It delivers accountability and a mechanism for redress and sanctions if a legal practitioner's professional practice is called into question.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the restricted period, a practitioner may apply for an unrestricted certificate. To be successful, practitioners must first complete the relevant state law society's unrestricted practising certificate course and obtain all relevant registrations and insurance. Furthermore, all unrestricted and restricted legal practitioners must complete 10 units of continuing legal education each year, the cost of which can be in excess of $5,000. Any firm that employs a solicitor must bear that cost on behalf of the employee, placing additional pressures on small businesses of two to five solicitors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, should a legal practitioner train in and provide migration advice and services, they are required to do so under a completely separate registration stream that is, essentially, a duplication of the process I have just outlined for regular legal practitioners. With these amendments today we will remove the requirement for that second stream of registration and regulation of legal practitioners by the Migration Agents Registration Authority. In doing so we remove the burdensome and duplicative chores of additional costs, training and further specialised compulsory legal education. This bill will ensure the removal of these unnecessary and costly requirements by recognising that the dual registration of restricted and unrestricted legal practitioners is an unnecessary administrative burden in circumstances where a strict professional regulatory regime already exists, which is subject to annual and random audit processes. This structure itself is good governance and duplication is unwarranted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Upon passing of this bill, and pursuant to schedule 1, lawyers who hold unrestricted practising certificates will immediately be removed from regulation under the Migration Agents Registration Authority and continue to be regulated by the relevant state or territory law society. Those legal practitioners who hold restricted practising certificates will have a period of two years in which they may be registered as both migration agents and restricted legal practitioners. The clear intent is to provide reasonable opportunity for these practitioners to make any necessary changes to their business affairs and certification.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once the eligible period has expired these practitioners will also be removed from the OMARA regulations, providing they complete the required programs to be eligible for an unrestricted practising certificate within the guidelines of their respective state or territory law societies. Because the two existing registration streams are essentially identical, removal of one stream, in accordance with changes under this bill, will not water down any consumer protections. I commend the government for recognising the need for strong regulatory protections for the consumer, particularly those not engaging legal practitioners but instead registered migration agents. Registered migration agents already work to the highest standards and requirements in provision of competent migration advice, and the changes under this bill will not negatively impact upon this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the introduction of the Graduate Diploma in Australian Migration Law and Practice in 2018 this sector gained meaningful credibility. Those requirements replaced a five-day course, a course which was not to the standard needed of the profession and not to the standard that consumers deserve. Implementation of this recent qualification has served to ensure only applicants of high standards obtain the registration and also serves to mitigate the risk of neglect or poor advice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The single most common inquiry my office receives is migration related. It is an extremely emotive issue, often involving families and people whose entire future is on the line. It is vitally important that these people who put their trust in an agent are assured of the quality of the information and advice they receive from that agent. Accordingly, pursuant to schedule 2 of this bill, the period an individual has in which to apply for repeat registration following the completion of the required qualification will be set in the legislation complementing the introduction of the graduate diploma, the qualifications of which never lapse. The existing system does not permit this streamlined process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note this bill seeks to protect the rights of eligible applicants for registration as migration agents by removing provisions to refuse applications where an applicant fails to provide further information. Common sense dictates that not all circumstances are within the control of the applicant to respond to such requests in a timely fashion. Because this bill recognises that, incomplete applications will remain unfinished for an indefinite period, saving the applicant hundreds of dollars and time in reapplying.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, this bill goes further in slashing unnecessary red tape by repealing certain provisions that reflect consolidation of the OMARA into the Department of Home Affairs. I'm pleased to hear that Labor is supporting this bill, as they must hate it. Removing red tape and relieving burdens and fees on business is not in their DNA. They're usually doing quite the opposite. So I'm pleased that today at least they have seen fit to support Australian business. I commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  Today, I'd like to congratulate the Morrison government on practising what we preach when it comes to cutting red tape—this time in relation to the Migration Amendment (Regulation of Migration Agents) Bill 2019.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bemusing situation of migration agents who are also lawyers having to register with their state government and the federal government is about as clear-cut as it gets when trying to address regulation in this country. The government has long supported the key measures in schedule 1 to the bill, which will see some lawyers practising in the migration field removed from unnecessary dual regulation by the Office of the Migration Agents Registration Authority—OMARA—and, instead, be subject to regulation by their relevant state or territory legal professional body. The amendments made by schedule 2 reflect the government's commitment to improving the entry-level standards to the migration advice profession through improving and streamlining the qualification requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are four more changes covered in this bill, and they are all designed to streamline a sector that is very important—especially to regional Australia. Without skilled migrants, businesses in my home region of North Queensland would be forced to close. From the tiny town of Coen in Cape York to the famous Nick's Restaurant in Yungaburra on the Atherton Tablelands or the Laura Johnson Home in Mount Isa, and in numerous cattle stations, cafes and pubs, international arrivals are constantly filling staffing shortages. Everywhere I travel in regional Queensland I'm told by business owners that without migrants things would be very grim indeed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, at the little town of Richmond, 400 kilometres west of Townsville, I met three young women from Estonia. One was pulling beers at a local pub and the other two were living on local cattle stations, working as general hands. It remains extraordinary to me that there are those people in this place and the other who don't understand that despite the extraordinarily high unemployment rates of over 20 per cent that we have in regional Queensland—and in Townsville youth unemployment stood at 17 per cent prior to COVID, I should flag—we still struggle to find employees to work in the most basic of roles. It has become a rite of passage for young people from around the world to travel to regional and outback Queensland and Australia to work in tourism and to work on cattle stations—and, it seems, for a large number of Irish people to work in regional pubs, where they see the summer temperatures of between 40 and 50 degrees as something interesting and unusual. It is very difficult to find Australians to work in those roles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Mount Isa, at the Laura Johnson Home, many of the nurses hail from the Philippines and Sri Lanka, and the centre's manager regards them as virtually indispensable in the care of those most vulnerable and elderly in our community. In fact, remote nursing homes at places like Doomadgee, Mornington Island and Normanton are all struggling to fill roles in the care of many Indigenous and other Australians who desperately need a ratio of care to make these safe and comfortable places for them to live in. And yet each year those care facilities are forced to pay more and more for contract staff to come and spend some time in these very important communities, caring for these people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, at Coen, 428 kilometres north of Cairns, a couple from Argentina were out manning a local service station and general store. I've already mentioned Yungaburra on the Atherton Tablelands west of Cairns. Nick Crameri told me he couldn't operate without migrant workers in his kitchen and on the floor as waiting staff. It will probably surprise you, Acting Deputy President Walsh, that butcher shops and other meat-processing facilities across the country rely on skilled tradesmen coming from Africa and other parts of the world to fill these roles, because, in many cases, supermarkets, who now sell over 80 per cent of red meat in our sector, are not training. They're not putting through apprentices as butchers and slicers, so we rely on skilled migrants coming to work as smallgoods makers and in other highly skilled roles in the meat area.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems that we talk a lot about the jobs that Australians are looking for around the country, but regional Australia relies on those people who come out to experience the unique and interesting world that we have and to fill these roles that businesses would otherwise just not be able to manage. In Mount Isa, the cafes have a constant stream of young people coming through. They are providing the services and baking the cakes that keep Australians going in coffee shops and other service industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is critical and crucial that the federal government continues to improve and streamline regulations in the migration space, but it must do so without compromising on measures to weed out some potential rogue operators. I remember, in my time running butcher shops, some of the people who would come to me and tell me stories of migration agents who seemed to make the process particularly long and particularly expensive, which is not right, nor is it fair for those people who just seek to call Australia home. The Morrison government takes seriously its commitment to character and background checks for migrants and is now diligent in its scrutiny of these migration agents. This legislation, while still improving efficiency in this sector, compromises none of this, and that is why this is just one more piece of streamlining and red-tape removal that is so critical to our nation. We know that it is in regional Australia where we build our prosperity, and it is in regional Australia where we build industries where families grow and enjoy a lifestyle. That is why I commend these changes to the Senate.</span>

This package of amendments contains two bills, the Migration Amendment (Regulation of Migration Agents) Bill 2019 and the Migration Agents Registration Application Charge Amendment (Rates of Charge) Bill 2019. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee report, released on 27 February 2020, recommended the Senate pass the bills without delay. The 2014 Independent Review of the Office of the Migration Agents Registration Authority recommended, amongst other things, that legal practitioners be removed from the regulatory scheme governing migration agents. The regulation of migration agents bill draws from this recommendation.</span>

Of course, we know that Mr Shorten supported the automation of this process and we know that Chris Bowen also supported that principle.

I acknowledge the commitment of all of us on the government's side of the chamber to rural and regional Australia and, of course, Australians who live there. As we know, rural and regional Australians are incredibly resilient. This has been highlighted in particular by the incidents of the recent droughts, bushfires, the floods and, of course, the impact of COVID-19. But, as we have all witnessed, rural and regional Australians have come through these significant challenges because of their fighting spirit. It is a fighting spirit that Senator Davey would know cannot be underestimated.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal and National governments are proud to support rural and regional Australians. Why? Because it's in our DNA. Last week the government announced that drought affected communities across Australia will benefit from 163 local infrastructure and community building projects as part of a $207 million investment under round 4 of the Australian government's Building Better Regions Fund. This fund provides grants of up to $10 million to local governments or incorporated not-for-profit organisations for infrastructure and community initiatives. The fund invests in community projects that create jobs, drive economic growth and build stronger regional and rural communities into the future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The most recent round of the Building Better Regions Fund specifically focuses on helping communities that have been hardest hit by the crippling droughts. We know that many regional communities continue to face the effects of the prolonged dry spell. Our message as a government to them is clear: we understand that you are suffering, and we understand the challenges that you are facing.</span>

Parcel volumes were up by 64 per cent in April year on year, and letter volumes were down by 36 per cent year on year; 200,000 new households are shopping online.

Today it's reported that five of the six COVID commissioners, who are advising how to rebuild after the pandemic, have refused to make public their declarations about conflicts of interest. The members of the manufacturing task force of the COVID commission don't even have to disclose their conflicts of interest to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Yet, one of the members, James Fazzino, not only is a director of APA Group but holds around $350,000 worth of their shares. That company will build the pipeline to the Narrabri gas fields. Guess what? The tasks force strongly recommends that that very gas pipeline be supported by government. Will the Prime Minister now require the financial interests of all task force members to be disclosed, or do you not even care anymore about how in the pocket of the coal, oil and gas industry the government is?</span>

Greenhouse gas emissions from gas extraction have grown 73 per cent in the last five years. Over the same time there have been three major bleaching events on the Great Barrier Reef. Gas is toxic for our climate. Do you prioritise a handful of jobs for your donors or countless species and the 60,000 Queenslanders and Australians who rely on a healthy Great Barrier Reef for their livelihoods?</span>

We prioritise the public interest. We prioritise jobs. We prioritise opportunity for Australians to get ahead. You know what, we're doing so in a way that is absolutely committed to strong environmental protection, strong environmental standards, but we will ensure that we pursue environmental protection in a way that is economically responsible. You are, sort of, now trying to say that gas is a terrible thing. Australian gas can help reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, in particular when it displaces other more polluting energy sources. This proposition that somehow we ought to demonise any form of Australian produced energy source is ridiculous. You go to the next election demonising gas production when it's one of our very important sectors in our economy, making a productive and positive contribution to environmental protection. You go right ahead. We will— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Let me ask the Labor Party: which program do you think we should scrap? JobKeeper or jobseeker? Should we cut the jobseeker payment in half? Is that what you are suggesting? The implication of your question is that you don't want us to spend the money we're spending in supporting business, supporting jobs and supporting the economy.

                  </a>  Senator Watt talks about spending. Spending as a share of GDP was heading way beyond. We brought spending as a share of GDP down below the long-term average. Labor were running it past 30 per cent of the share of the economy, according to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Intergenerational r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eport</span>. The Labor Party position is completely inconsistent. They are arguing for more spending and fewer cuts but somehow think that that is going to lead to less debt. Their position of fewer cuts and higher spending would lead to higher debt. That is basic mathematics. I know that that is not something that the Labor Party understood in government, which is why when we came into government we inherited a seriously rapidly deteriorating budget position. Their revenue forecasts were based on absolute—I was going to say something rude— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Minister, the Treasurer approves 99.9 per cent of all acquisition proposals that are first considered by the Foreign Investment Review Board. On those rare occasions when the Treasurer says no to foreign investment, he must find the proposed investment would be contrary to the national interest. The current legal framework, which can stop foreign ownership of critical or essential Australian assets, does not include the ownership of surface water or groundwater. As a result, unlimited amounts of water can be foreign owned in Australia. At the end of 2018, the ATO reported that 10 per cent of all water entitlements in Australia were in foreign hands. Minister, is there any percentage of foreign ownership of water that would cause the government to consider it contrary to the national interest?</span>

The first point I would make is that Australia does rely on foreign investment in order to reach and meet our economic growth opportunities. We are a capital importer in order to develop our economy, though it is important that any foreign investment is not contrary to the national interest. We have a well-established framework in place to review foreign investment proposals to ensure that they are not contrary to the national interest. That scheme has broadly been in place since 1975. In more recent times a number of reforms have been announced in relation to this, fundamentally to strengthen the level of scrutiny in the context of relevant proposals coming forward.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've made some temporary adjustments in the context of the COVID-19 crisis to ensure that Australian businesses at this difficult time are protected from the threat of inappropriate foreign takeovers at a time of comparative weakness and challenge. We've also recently made some significant reform announcements in relation to national security sensitive businesses. Critical infrastructure is, of course, one of the areas where we've put some additional safeguards and powers for the Treasurer into this framework. I don't believe it would be useful to provide arbitrary targets around what would or would not be a desirable level of foreign investment in relation to a particular asset class. I think we've got to determine whether or not there is a particular reason why a particular investment would be contrary to the national interests. Ultimately, there is a high level of discretion for the Treasurer to make relevant judgements in this place. But let me just conclude on this point: foreign investment is very important for our future economic growth and success and for the opportunity— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The first responsibility of any Australian government is to keep Australia and Australians safe. That's why the Morrison government is investing over $200 billion to deliver the modern Defence Force our nation needs. This government recognises that the security dynamics in our region are deteriorating, and we must invest in Australia's naval capability to address these challenges. Highly capable maritime forces are vital to our defence strategy, and none more than submarines. By 2035, we estimate that we will have over 300 submarines operating in our region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a maritime nation, our future prosperity depends on a stable, rules based order and the free flow of goods and services across our region through international sea lines of communication. This government's Australian Naval Shipbuilding Enterprise is unprecedented in both scale and ambition. In Australia, we are simultaneously building five separate classes of new vessels, including the highly complex submarines and frigates. In total, we have commissioned 63 Australian built naval vessels. Six have already been delivered and nine more are currently under construction. For the Hunter class anti-submarine warfare frigates and the Arafura class offshore patrol vessels, we have adopted ambitious but deliverable schedules for design and for construction. Not only has this saved Australian jobs but it is also creating many thousands more for many decades to come.</span>

They are halfway through their life and are being constantly upgraded right here in Australia to ensure that they remain regionally superior until the introduction of the Attack class submarines in the early 2030s. The competitive evaluation process that was completed in 2016 allowed this government to make a fully informed decision to build 12 new regionally superior submarines in Australia. That process found that there were no military off-the-shelf submarines internationally that met our very unique requirements. Can I say again: this is being delivered on track and on time.</span>

Again, can I be very, very clear about this project to all in this chamber: there is no blow-out to the cost of the Future Submarine project. There is no cost blow-out to the Future Submarine project! When we announced the program in April 2016, the estimated cost for acquisition, in 2016 dollars, was $50 billion. There has been no change to this cost in constant-dollar terms.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Future Submarine program will run well into the 2050s, and the use of constant dollars allows for a consistent comparison of purchasing power over the life of the project. The deliberate conflation by Labor of constant costs without outturn costs, which take into account inflation and exchange rates, is incredibly misleading and incredibly disappointing for a great Australian project. To put this very simply: comparing constant and outturn dollars does not represent a cost increase— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Minister, I refer you to the ongoing situation at Kangaroo Point in Brisbane, where your government is trying to force refugees and people seeking asylum from the so-called 'alternative place of detention' into an actual immigration detention facility. I've spoken personally to one of your innocent prisoners, who was told directly that he was being forcibly moved because he had spoken out publicly about the injustices he's faced over the last nearly seven years. Is it true that you are specifically moving people who have spoken out in the media or who have otherwise protested against their detention in order to silence their dissent?</span>

Now, for the benefit, again, of Senator McKim: the man at the centre of these protests—goodness, gracious!—is Brisbane Greens councillor, Jonathan Sri. For the record, Brisbane Greens councillor, Jonathan Sri's actions are completely, totally and utterly unacceptable for a public official, and I would hope that Senator McKim would agree.</span>

Protesters—I again note the congratulations of Senator McKim—are also breaching social-distancing restrictions. What is that doing? Risking the spread of COVID-19, not only amongst the community, Senator McKim, but amongst the people that you are allegedly standing here and expressing fake concern for. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Yesterday the government announced that it was committing $11.5 million to mental health support for emergency services workers who were impacted by the recent devastating bushfire season. Yesterday's announcement was in fact just a reannouncement of the $16 million in mental health funding that the government announced in January. Why has the government's mental health support for emergency service workers to date been two press releases and not a single dollar spent?</span>

I can say that the federal government, the coalition government, the Morrison government, is absolutely committed to helping Australians who have been impacted by bushfire, which is why we continue to invest money in this recovery. We also acknowledge, as do you, Senator, that the bushfires in 2019-20 have taken a very serious toll on the mental health of Australians. It has taken a very traumatic, emotional toll on those people who were affected in those communities. I know firsthand from the communities that I have had involvement with in South Australia that it was a very tragic and terrifying time, and the impact lingers, exacerbated even further by the fact that they have now had to contend with the implications and the consequences of the actions that have had to be taken around the coronavirus pandemic.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has committed over $100 million in mental health support for emergency personnel, individuals and communities impacted by the 'black summer' bushfires. These include $76 million for a bushfire recovery mental health package announced on 12 January this year. That package included free access to counselling in bushfire affected areas; Medicare rebated psychological support, including via telehealth, which is particularly relevant given the COVID crisis; money for Primary Health Networks for additional services and to administer grants into local communities; and specific support for emergency service workers and their families. In response to the need for more community based support, the government has since announced an additional $13.5 million for primary care in the Primary Health Networks, and this is very, very specific—</span>

That this government would be prioritising anything over what is tremendously important, dealing with the fallout and impact on the mental health of Australians who have been impacted by bushfires, is an outrageous comment. We are absolutely committed to supporting our emergency service workers, who spent many, many, many weeks—many more weeks than we've ever seen before—out fighting fires. The impact on the mental health of those emergency workers—the post-traumatic stress disorders, the mental illnesses and sadly in some cases the suicides—is something that this government takes very, very seriously. And we remain absolutely committed to helping these people over the longer term, making sure that they have the support that they need.</span>

We know the COVID-19 challenge has brought a range of difficulties to our region. Health systems and livelihoods have been put seriously at risk. With our Pacific island neighbours, together we acted decisively to contain the spread of the virus and we stood together in our responses.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Framing our response, as the senator said, we released Australia's new development strategy, Partnerships for Recovery, focusing on the Pacific, Timor Leste and Indonesia and concentrating on three areas: health, stability and economic recovery. This entails a pivot of our development effort towards the immediate needs of partners in our region. We're also making important contributions to the global response and to the recovery, committing $352 million at the European Union conference for vaccines, diagnostics and treatment and $300 million to Garvi the Vaccine Alliance, which was recognised today by a motion in this chamber. I acknowledge the support of the chamber for that. </span>

Thirty Pacific parliamentary and civil service women leaders from 18 countries—an impressive meeting in anyone's terms—agreed to work together to explore new ways to enhance the wellbeing of women and girls. Contributions canvassed the economic impact, family concerns, women's safety, jobs and cultural issues—thought provoking and vital for shared understanding of the challenges. Our Partnerships for Recovery strategy is underpinned by our focus on the most vulnerable and includes addressing gender specific impacts of COVID-19. Australia stands with Pacific women at this time.</span>

Debt will always be lower under the Liberal and National parties than it would have been under the Labor Party. The Labor Party, of course, left behind a rapidly deteriorating budget position. They left behind ludicrous revenue assumptions like $120 a tonne for iron ore, which meant that the revenue they assumed they would collect was way above anything that was ever going to be realistic.

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians (Senator Colbeck) to the question without notice asked by Senator Kitching today relating to Australia Post.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The question was asked of the Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians because of how many senior Australians depend on our postal service. In fact, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic all Australians have relied on posties to deliver essential items they needed. There's been a parcel boom as people have turned to online shopping and local providers. Our posties endure all types of weather, difficult terrain and, it goes out saying, swooping magpies. We rely on our posties, and they work hard for us. We often, though, just expect that the work they do will continue on, but now the Morrison government wants to rip that away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the cover of the coronavirus crisis and during a recession, the Morrison government is ripping thousands of Australia Post jobs away. The regulations the Morrison government wants to impose will let Australia Post scale back services, slash jobs and cut wages. One in four jobs—gone. The livelihoods of thousands of Australians—gone. Income for their families during a recession—gone. There will be longer waits for mail and for parcels. These changes will hit regional Australia the hardest. People in regional Australia will be forced to wait even longer than they currently do for mail and for small parcels. In Queanbeyan alone, the Morrison government's regulation will slash the frequency of postie rounds by half. Mail delivery time frames will blow out from three business days to seven business days. Now is not the time to be slashing jobs in regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Disgracefully, the government has tried to use the coronavirus pandemic as an excuse for these horrendous changes. The Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians said the government was 'assisting Australians through the COVID-19 outbreak', but they're not, and they're certainly not assisting Australia's posties.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The regulation making these changes was made by the government with no consultation. They did not speak with employees or employee representatives. Imagine that: making a change that's going to cost one in four jobs and cut wages during a recession and not speaking to employees or to employee representatives. This is a cheap shot at the workers of Australia Post. You can't say that you're for all Australians and then cut one in four jobs at Australia Post.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The boom in parcel delivery should be an opportunity to grow jobs, not to cut them. If parcel numbers are booming then why is Australia Post talking about redundancies? Why won't the Prime Minister work with our posties to guarantee their jobs and their futures? Why do posties and staff at Australia Post storefronts, from the cities to the suburbs to the regions, still have to live with the uncertainty that their jobs might be ripped away from them during a recession? The Morrison government must guarantee the thousands of postie jobs in Australia and those that service our communities. I mean, for a Prime Minister who loves a slogan, the small parcel boom should be a 'job maker' opportunity. Instead Scott Morrison, in these cuts to Australia Post, is just showing that he's a job faker, not a job maker.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the government has given no guarantees that the changes won't be made permanent following the coronavirus crisis. As we well know, Mr Morrison says one thing yet does another. We just can't trust this Prime Minister anymore. He said that JobKeeper would last until September, and then he ripped it away from 120,000 early childcare workers. He said robodebt was lawful, and it turns out it wasn't. Yesterday he apologised—something the leader of the government in this chamber is yet to do. The Prime Minister said he'd stop the boats, and then he let in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ruby Princess</span>—the one boat that mattered—which led to the biggest spike in coronavirus cases in Australia and an outbreak in north-west Tasmania.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now the Prime Minister says these changes to Australia Post are temporary. But how do we know we can trust him when he says that? How do the people of regional Australia know they can trust this Prime Minister when he says that these changes—the doubling of the wait time for mail and small parcels—are temporary? It is going to affect people in Queanbeyan, in Cooma, in Jindabyne and in Merimbula. You used to be able to trust this government to make sure that the post worked, that you'd get your mail. But you just can't trust them anymore. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="N26" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ABETZ</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:07</span>):  This is a clear example of what the Labor Party gets up to. I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her contribution, because it exposes the falsehoods that are always spun into their narrative. I would invite the deputy leader to actually listen to what the CEO of Australia Post, one Ms Holgate, has had to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Unfortunately there has been a range of false claims made about the temporary changes to our regulations. We are not forcing 2,000 of our valued posties into redundancies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is an unequivocal statement from the CEO of Australia Post. Yet a senior member of the Australian Labor Party seeks to assert the exact opposite—a complete falsehood, with no fact and no substantiation offered—whereas we on the government side are able to show the support and substantiation from the CEO of Australia Post, keeping in mind that Australia Post is a government business enterprise in which the government of the day cannot interfere. If I recall correctly, that was a change made to Australia Post by none other than the then Labor minister for communications, one Mr Kim Beazley. So, it was a Labor change that does not allow government to make those sorts of interferences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another statement from the CEO of Australia Post:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Union claims as many as one in four postie jobs will be impacted are false.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But who made that claim? Senator Keneally, right in here, made that false claim. Why? Because her union bosses told her to do so. Yet we now know that it is completely and utterly false. If Senator Keneally wants to practice what she preaches at us, she will be coming in here to apologise for misleading the Senate, either knowingly or unwittingly—her choice, but clearly a falsehood and a misleading of the Senate. What is more, Senator Keneally made the false assertion that there was no consultation with the union movement, yet the CEO of Australia Post says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We continue to extensively consult with the union on issues and challenges COVID-19 has presented …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So either we believe Senator Keneally or we believe Ms Holgate, the CEO of Australia Post. There is, unfortunately, a developing consistency about Senator Keneally's contributions in this place and in the public space: you can't rely on what she says. It is spin, and it is spin that is not based on truth and is not based on evidence. It is spin designed to help the Australian Labor Party's ever-flagging political fortunes. What did Senator Keneally spin into her narrative? A number of townships around the electorate of Eden-Monaro. What are they doing? The ALP, very transparently, are peddling falsehoods. Like they did with 'Mediscare' in 2016, they have put a false narrative out into the electorate in a desperate attempt to win votes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They cannot win votes on their own merit. If they sought to, you just had to listen to question time today. What was the first question from Senator Gallagher about? The ever-increasing debt. Two or three questions later, the question was about the government not spending enough. So we are condemned for an increased debt, then we are attacked for not spending enough. The narrative is completely and utterly inconsistent, and that is why the Australian Labor Party so consistently leaves the Australian economy in a mess. And, when it does so, it means that Australians lose their jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why the economic management of this country is so fundamental, and that is why it's so important that people seeking to offer themselves to public life understand the importance of the economy. We on this side do. Senator Keneally and the Labor Party have today displayed and disclosed they do not understand it. I invite Senator Keneally to be honest and put into the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> record Ms Holgate's statements. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KIM CARR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:12</span>):  I rise to take note of the answer to the question on postal services. It's not the first time we have seen that this pandemic has provided this government with an opportunity to use the threat of this plague to pursue a covert and insidious policy agenda. And, in this case, we see that the government has used this crisis to allow it to close many of our postal outlets, cut essential services and put more Australians out of work. We have to remember that the service that Australia Post provides is not just about delivering parcels from the latest purchases on the internet; it's about the provision of essential services, like the carriage of medicines. These changes have been made without consultation with the relevant stakeholders—staff or customers. They were introduced with exemptions provided by the Prime Minister on 18 March under the regulations, where a complete regulatory impact statement was not needed and was not provided. It was not delivered to the union. It was provided by the management as a basis for full implementation—not on the basis of temporary operation, but on the basis of permanent operation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Subsequent amendments to these regulations will effectively allow for the closure of post office outlets throughout regional Australia. At present, Australia Post is required to maintain at least 4,000 retail outlets. At least 50 per cent of those outlets and no fewer than 2,500 outlets have to be provided in rural areas. In the metropolitan areas, they must be located so that at least 90 per cent of the population is within 2½ kilometres of such an outlet. In non-metropolitan areas, 85 per cent of residents must be within 7½ kilometres of an outlet. These regulations change that formula, because, under these circumstances, if the management so determines, they have the discretion to close post offices. What's the evidence for that? It's in the explanatory memorandum. Read the explanatory memorandum!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The explanatory memorandum says that on these staffing applications the new regulations state that, in all talks of retail outlets, workers of retail outlets are to be interpreted broadly. This was the concern that we adopted through the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Delegated Legislation, a bipartisan committee where we saw both opposition and government senators write to the minister asking for an explanation of why these discrepancies have occurred and why it is that there should be a deterioration in service provision for the Australian people of an essential service like Australia Post. What we looked to was the explanatory memorandum for evidence of what the government's doing, and I urge senators to actually read these documents. Before you cast judgement, read the actual documents that Australia Post itself has put out on behalf of the government. These changes will reduce letter delivery standards, while priority mail services are to be suspended, the maximum delivery time for mail within one state is to increase to the day of posting plus five business days and delivery frequency in metropolitan areas will be decreased from daily delivery to alternate business day delivery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government, of course, has provided no attempt to consult with the union about the job losses that will inevitably flow from this. We know that the sale of assets has already begun. We know that up to 2½ thousand job losses are predicted, and this does not include the job losses in mail rooms that support Australia Post. The government pretends it's about defending rural interests. Of course, it doesn't go anywhere near the consequences of the reduction of services to rural communities like those provided by Australia Post. Australia Post remains a trusted and valued public institution. We cannot afford to allow it to be fattened up for privatisation, as this government has done in so many other areas. We have to be careful of the consequences of the loss of public trust in valuable institutions like Australia Post. What we know is that the revenue for Australia Post from its parcel service delivery is actually growing dramatically. I don't want to see Amazon or any other organisation of that type take over what should be the proper function of an essential public institution like Australia Post. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McDONALD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:17</span>):  It is a very exciting day when you hear the Labor Party rediscover regional Australia, because regional Australians know that they completely forgot about them going into the last election. In fact, I was absolutely delighted to discover that Senator Keneally thinks that Queanbeyan is the heart of regional Australia. As a regional Australian, as a regional Queenslander, I need to let her know that being in Queanbeyan does not mean that you're way out in the sticks. But it is great to know that the Labor Party has rediscovered this essential part of the country! And Senator Carr has continued with that discovery. It's an exciting day for regional Australia to have the Labor Party remember that they exist!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is always disturbing to hear the Labor Party start talking about facts, because they're generally very short on them, and today's facts are a hodgepodge of made-up numbers and scare campaigns. They've absolutely not read the reality of what is going on for Australia, both regional and urban, as a result of COVID-19 and, in addition to that, the change in consumer habits, with people relying more and more on online shopping and parcel deliveries. In fact, parcel volumes this year were up 64 per cent in April year on year, and letter volumes were down 36 per cent in May year on year. I'm sure that Senator Keneally and Senator Carr can both remember the happy days of receiving a handwritten letter in your letterbox, the joy of tearing open the mail to see what exciting news you'd received from far away, maybe even from regional Australia, but that is, of course, a thing of the past these days. It is less likely that you will receive a handwritten card or note in the mail.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, even shopping has changed. We had 200,000 new households shopping online for the first time in April this year. Whether it be clothes, books or even food, the delivery of all sorts of products to people's homes has changed the way we live completely because of the very necessary restrictions on movements due to COVID this year. So, in response to Australia Post's requests, the government had to temporarily adjust some elements of the regulations to allow Australia Post to deliver on these changed requirements in this era of COVID. It has given Australia Post flexibility to retrain and redeploy its workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government completely rejects Labor's misleading and baseless scare campaign around changes to Australia Post. These changes are not permanent. They are temporary and they are subject to review. There will be no forced redundancies or cuts to posties' take-home pay. Delivery frequency in regional, rural and remote Australia will not change. Licensed post offices are actively supportive of these relief measures. Once again, I, too, am confused by Labor's mixed messages. One moment they think the debt is too high and in the next they think it is too low. It is just another example of the confusion that Labor are in. The Labor Party and the Labor plan were unanimously rejected by Australians right across this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's important to acknowledge the flexibility that Australia Post has been able to demonstrate during this time, particularly in their partnership with the Pharmacy Guild to deliver medicines to homes for vulnerable and isolating people. This was available nationally. This was a terrific example of how modern practices were able to change quickly to meet the changing demands of Australians who, unlike other people in this chamber, followed medical advice, stayed home, self-isolated and got Australia through this terrible pandemic by flattening the curve.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="140651" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'NEILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:22</span>):  I appreciate the opportunity to respond to the nonanswer which is typical of the form we normally see Minister Colbeck show in this place, and once again he showed it today. I would have to describe his response when he was asked to give his view about what was happening with Australia Post on behalf of the older Australians in the country who so predominantly rely on this particularly important essential service as shocked that he should have even been asked. He was asked if he has paid attention to his responsibilities as minister to consult with older Australians. Surely if the minister had undertaken any consultation in any form whatsoever with older Australians about their views with regards to the changes to Australia Post he would have been able to name at least a couple of conversations that he'd had and at least a couple of consultations with leading senior advocates. However, his response through his nonanswer of his shock and his failure to indicate any consultation at all reveals that Minister Colbeck has once again failed Australians who so predominantly rely on Australia Post to deliver the vital information and, indeed, as Senator Carr has indicated, the vital service that's provided through Australia Post in delivering medication to older Australians right across this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Colbeck is not the only one who is responsible for making sure that older Australians are made aware of changes that will impact on their lives. In fact, there are many champions who do listen to the older community around this country. One of them on his own team is Senator Fierravanti-Wells, who herself raised concerns the government had acted in haste in delivering regulatory reform without proper scrutiny that is going to make a significant change to the way that Australia Post operates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have heard all of the excuses under the sun from those opposite who have participated in this debate this afternoon about why we should trust this government—that the changes they're going to bring in are only temporary. But we cannot afford to trust this government. This is a government which, just a couple weeks ago, misplaced $60 billion. This is the government that delivered robodebt, and the impact of that on hundreds and thousands of Australians is something that they should be absolutely ashamed of. This is the government that has proven over and over again to Australians that it is completely untrustworthy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the critical things that we know from Australia Post right across this country, and particularly in regional Australia, is how central it is to every single community. The community that I live in on the Central Coast has a very small post office in the newsagency—that is commonly where these things are located—and it is a hub for the distribution of information around our community. The posties who operate out of these post offices across the country not only deliver very important mail and essential goods, such as pharmaceuticals, to Australians right across this nation but are also part of the social fabric of the country. Just being able to move around the community to deliver mail and noticing when mail isn't picked up are important ways in which the community is able to keep track of what's happening amongst the population that is being served by each of those Australia Post offices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Carr raised a very, very important point about the detail that is embedded in the explanatory memorandum that relates to the actions that are possible from this government with regard to Australia Post. The determination of Australia Post as an essential service makes it very, very different from other entities around this country. Having a ratio of Australia Post outlets not only provides security for the delivery of mail, and also of parcels, but also provides important distribution of an essential service. There are serious considerations given by governments of both persuasions from time to time to how the network of Australia Post might provide additional services and access to government services. An assumption is often made by those who don't understand the true nature of access to internet in this country, but not all Australians have access to internet services and the sort of shopping that has been described in this debate this afternoon. People who don't have the internet are particularly vulnerable when it comes to interacting with the government and they need access to the proper services which only Australia Post can provide. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I asked Minister Cash about the situation, which is still ongoing, where a number of refugees and people seeking asylum who have been imprisoned in a hotel in Kangaroo Point are being forcibly moved to immigration detention by the Department of Home Affairs. This terrible circumstance highlights a number of issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, it's how this government continues to find new ways to extend the utter despair of people who have now spent nearly seven years in detention—most of it exiled on either Manus Island or Nauru, where some still remain; others are currently in Australia. It's not only extending their despair, it's extending the terrible harm that it has caused them and which has already been perpetrated on them for far too long. This is seven years of death, seven years of misery and seven years of arbitrary detention—seven years of arbitrary indefinite detention. It's seven years of deliberate harm being caused to innocent people. Ultimately, this is seven years of torture, and it is not acceptable for a liberal democracy such as Australia to torture innocent people. And it ought not be acceptable for this chamber and this parliament to continue to support that torture.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people in Kangaroo Point are people who've been evacuated to Australia because of urgent medical need. They were evacuated under the medevac legislation. I spoke personally to one of the people the department was trying to move last night, and he was told directly that he's being moved because he spoke out against his mistreatment. That's why they chose him. Yet Minister Cash rose in question time today and denied that obvious truth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear about this: the government has picked out people who've spoken out about their mistreatment and who've hung banners from their hotel, and it is forcing them, against their will, into immigration detention centres. This is being done to silence their dissent and to prevent them from speaking out about the terrible injustices that our country has perpetrated upon them. If you had any doubt whether these people were political prisoners or not, that doubt should now be removed, because they are 100 per cent certainly political prisoners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the stuff of a totalitarian government, not how a government should behave in a so-called liberal democracy. Instead of locking them up, why not finally end their nearly seven years of torment and let them rebuild their lives in the Australian community, as we committed to do when we signed the protocol to the refugee convention? If the government is not prepared to do that, why not finally accept the kind and generous offer from the New Zealand government to resettle these people over time so they can rebuild their lives in New Zealand? How much more do these innocent people need to suffer? How many more years are going to be stolen from them? How many more families are going to be torn apart? How many more children are going to be harmed? How many more lives are going to be broken by this policy? When will it finally be long enough to satisfy the Liberal, National and Labor parties in this place?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the brave people who protested against these moves in Brisbane last night and again today.

I will also note that the Greens submitted additional comments because we thought that the report should go further. We were disappointed with the government's response because this was an important inquiry. It raised a whole number of points. The response fails to acknowledge the significant evidence that we heard and, in particular, does not properly address the recommendations. It also denies that jobactive is not fit for purpose. And, in fact, it is not fit for purpose, even more so during this pandemic. Also, coming out of it and during the recovery period, it is just not going to meet the needs of people who are looking for work. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The response doesn't acknowledge the problems and hurt caused by mutual obligations and the targeted compliance framework. For example, the committee recommended that the government look at transferring responsibility for compliance, which at the moment is with the employment consultants, to the jobactive providers. We recommended that that be transferred to the Public Service. This is an absolutely essential point because at the moment the requirement to fulfil the government's compliance work is actually eroding the trust between participants, jobseekers and the employment consultants. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm deeply alarmed that the government is planning to continue the mutual obligations and the targeted compliance framework as part of the new employment services model. Compliance does not lead to better outcomes for jobseekers and, in fact, the TCF is counterproductive and has a negative impact on jobseekers—in particular, on their mental health and wellbeing. It further entrenches disadvantage and poverty and in fact is leading to people dropping out of the system altogether. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm really worried that the new employment services model will not address these issues with job service providers, and, let me tell you, there have been a lot of problems with job service providers and my office has heard extensively about these problems. Despite mutual obligations being suspended, my office has been inundated with calls and messages during lockdown from people being harassed by job service providers. I've heard countless accounts of job service providers forcing people to sign job plans—the same old rubberstamp job plans that don't meet their needs, that are not individually focused. They've been told to undertake face-to-face appointments, for crying out loud, during lockdown and job service providers are threatening to cut off people's income support payments. During the pandemic this has been happening. Job service providers are doing this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here are some of the personal accounts we've heard from people struggling with their job service providers. The first said: 'My DES—the disability employment service—has rung me every fortnight for a phone appointment. I have also had them texting me asking me to email my resume through even though they have one on file. I often get called two or three times a week asking me have I applied for jobs that they see. I'm a single parent with an autoimmune disease and I'm also immune suppressed.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another mum newly on jobseeker was referred to and contacted by her JSP, who had her sign a new job search plan and release of information over an email. She was then phoned a fortnight later to see how her job search was going, even though mutual obligations were suspended. She also received another letter for a phone interview on the day she sent me this correspondence. She was asked whether she had found work. All of this contact has been during the suspension of mutual obligations. She said: 'My mum is really confused by all this. My job service provider here in Murray Bridge rang and told me that I had to do a four-day online course at home and, if I don't, I'll be forced to do it when mutual obligations are running again or face a 16-week payment suspension.' That's just not true. 'I am a single parent with a child on an altered education program that begins at 10.30 each day.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As you can hear from these—and I have got a lot more accounts of people's experiences—jobactive is not fit for purpose. It needs to be fixed. Mutual obligations need to continue to be suspended and we need a new way of supporting people.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:41</span>):  I also take note of the government's appalling response to the report by the Senate Education and Employment References Committee entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Jobactive: failing those it is intended to serve</span>. It was a very comprehensive report detailing myriad problems in the government's job services framework. We got this very flimsy reply. The report had 41 recommendations. How did the government respond to them? It said under the heading 'Recommendations 1 to 41': 'Job seekers in jobactive report they are satisfied with the quality of services.' It's a pretty arbitrary quoting of statistics. For stream A jobseekers it is but 58.7 per cent of jobseekers who say they are satisfied. That's not 'extremely satisfied' or 'you're terrific'; that's just a basic level of satisfaction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Siewert highlighted, the kinds of complaints that dog this system go to the very core of people's lives and their wellbeing. The jobseekers I speak to overwhelmingly tell me that they are not satisfied with the quality of services. ACOSS conducted a survey and found 73 per cent of jobactive participants were dissatisfied and only eight per cent were satisfied.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the kinds of things jobseekers say. In cases where they've acted in good faith, trying to engage with the provider they are allocated to by Centrelink, they have been ignored and not given any help finding work. Often that's because, as one example says, providers say to them: 'We don't get any money if we place you now. We'll wait another three months until you've been out of the workforce a bit longer and then we'll help you. Our contract is structured in such a way that we'll get a payment for placing you.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In cases where appointments have been made with agency staff, there have been occasions when no-one has actually been there. The provider made the appointment and the jobseeker, who was obliged to go, went to their appointment and found that the office was closed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People have told me that they were offered gift cards as an inducement to produce pay slips to their provider when they had gotten a new job and they had gotten that job off their own back. The provider who wanted to take credit and claim a payment for that job induced that person by giving them a gift certificate. They also tell me that their providers hold their jobseeker payment over them—as an overt threat—to get them to sign job plans or undertake unsuitable activity. So I do not accept the government's argument that jobseekers are simply satisfied with the employment services offering.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is true that the service providers bear the brunt of having to implement this government's policies and so their behaviour is contingent on the policy settings put in place by this government. You have your hands on the policy levers. You've created a system where providers' primary focus seems to be administering the targeted compliance framework, ensuring mutual obligation at the expense of providing jobseekers with meaningful assistance to get them back into the workforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government should be admitting right now that that system, as flawed as it was before, is even more flawed now. In a declining employment market what is the point of spending money to get people to comply to look for a job, particularly when you want to revert back to giving them a measly $40 a day in jobseeker payments. It is simply not going to work. We need employment services to be there to reinvigorate local economies and to be engaged with local employers. It should not be the primary remit of the employment service providers to enforce mutual obligation when it comes at the expense of finding jobseekers meaningful work. Now more than ever jobseekers in this country need an employment services system that actually works. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="250026" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LAMBIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:48</span>):  I rise to take note of the Minister for Defence's letter to the President of the Senate regarding Teddy Sheean. Denis Victor Reedman was a telegraphist on the HMAS<span style="font-style:italic;"> Armidale</span> in 1942. On 1 December 1942 Denis was with John Roberts in the radio room of HMAS<span style="font-style:italic;"> Armidale</span>. He heard his skipper yell, 'Get down.' That's when the torpedoes hit. Denis and John weren't injured in that strike. One room over everyone was killed—gone in a split second, just like that. He said, 'All you could hear was crying, young men dying, scared and calling out for their mums.' The ship is starting to list and it's taking on water fast. Denis scrambles to the outside of the ship. Japanese aircraft are firing machine guns at the fleeing crew. He said, 'It was mayhem, it was chaos and it was like hell on earth.' John said to him, 'Don't be a fool. Come with me.' They run back towards the ship's anti-aircraft cannon. Everyone is trying to get away. Bullets are screaming through the sky, tearing holes through the steel and people's skin. Denis sees some men missing their legs and some missing their jaws. He sees Ordinary Seaman Edward (Teddy) Sheean running the wrong way. Teddy sees the operator of the anti-aircraft cannon is dead. He straps himself onto it instead. He opens fire on a Japanese fighter and it's blown out of the sky. The two other planes notice what's happening. They stop firing on survivors who are floating helplessly in the water of the Timor Sea. They train their fire on the 18-year-old kid from Tassie, but Teddy keeps firing. The ship is almost completely under water. The waves are rising around him, the machine guns are blazing, and he keeps right on going. Bullets start hitting him and he's wounded badly. His leg is open. He can't stand anymore, but he just keeps right on going and another plane bursts into flames. While he's firing on the enemy, they're focused on him, so the crew is scrambling to safety. Teddy is losing blood and the water is rising. Everything he has to give, he gives, to keep firing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the space of less than a few minutes, it's over. It's all over. The ship is falling into the sea; the stern high in the air and the propellers still turning. There were 140 men who woke up that day hoping to be alive at the end of it. Teddy woke up wanting the same thing. Denis died in 1999, 57 years after Teddy did. In that time he left the Navy, he got a job, he had kids and he lived a life. In his own words, Teddy Sheean gave him that life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister says some reviews say Teddy deserves the Victoria Cross and some reviews say he doesn't. That's dishonest, because it misleads you into thinking all views are the same, and that's rubbish. We've had only one full, open examination of all the evidence. We've had only one that's opened up all the books, all the evidence and all the witnesses and asked the only question we need to ask: does Teddy Sheean deserve Australia's highest military honour, the Victoria Cross? Only one review has looked at all the questions. It came back and said: 'Yes. Absolutely, 100 per cent and then some.' Every single expert said that Teddy not only met the threshold for the Victoria Cross but far exceeded it. They said that Teddy's actions are the standard to which all men and women of the modern Navy hold themselves. They aspire to it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And the Prime Minister said: 'Well, who cares. Forget about what they say. Teddy gets nothing.' He took the experts' opinion and he ignored it, because he didn't like what the experts had to say. Now he's called in a different bunch of experts and asked them to have another shot. This time he's chosen his own experts. He's picked them himself. Maybe that's how you get the answer you want. But this isn't going away. You can't hide from this. You can't just say that it doesn't matter whether or not Teddy deserves the Victoria Cross. You can't just say: 'Too bad, so sad. Move on.' The motto of the HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Sheean </span>is 'Fight On'. That's the difference between us on Teddy's side and you on the Prime Minister's side. We have the will to fight and we will fight and continue the fight. I'll tell you what, we're going to win, because you on the other side will end up folding because you'll have no choice. You'll fold in shame, and, when you do, there will be an 18-year-old kid from Lower Barrington looking down on you and saying, 'What took you so bloody long?' I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill, along with the APRA Levy Imposition Bills being introduced alongside it, will ensure the Government's cost recovery arrangements for APRA continue to operate effectively. These Bills will do this by ensuring the Treasurer has adequate flexibility to set the levies at a level required for institutions to pay for their fair share, and by ensuring the Commonwealth can continue to collect relevant costs for its regulatory activities in the financial sector. Both of these changes reflect the evolving environment we are in.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Since 1998, when the APRA Act and the Levy Imposition Acts set the current levy arrangements, the role of APRA has expanded and increased. Additionally, other agencies have taken on a role in regulating the financial sector, the cost of which should be borne by those institutions that bring about the need for the regulation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Amendment (Prohibiting Academic Cheating Services) Bill 2019 implements recommendations of the Higher Education Standards Panel to deter third party academic cheating services in higher education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The growing availability and provision of academic cheating services poses a significant threat to the integrity and reputation of the higher education sector, both in Australia and internationally. Third party cheating activity commonly involves the provision of bespoke academic material that is subsequently submitted by a student for assessment, or a third party impersonating a student in an exam or practical test.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Promotion of cheating services to students has become widespread in recent years, through on-campus advertising, email and social media. Students are being inundated with targeted promotions for cheating services highlighting their ease of access, minimal cost and low risk of detection, while downplaying the ethical dishonesty involved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While many aspects of these services and their use are already subject to criminal and civil penalties for various offences such as fraud or misrepresentation, these can be complex and difficult to pursue. They also provide little deterrence, as there is no specific law that clearly and simply says the provision of cheating assistance is wrong. This makes it too easy for unscrupulous purveyors of these destructive harmful products to trick vulnerable students – particularly those under stress, or having difficulty with their studies, that it is OK to buy an essay or have someone else take an exam for them. That no-one will find out; or, if they do, that there will be no consequences.</span>
                </p>

                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The bill will make it an offence to provide, arrange or advertise academic cheating services to students studying with Australian higher education providers, whether the service is provided from within Australia or overseas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Criminal and civil penalties of up to two years' jail and fines of up to 500 penalty units (around $100,000) will apply where the cheating service or advertising is for a commercial purpose.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Civil penalties of up to 500 penalty units will apply where the cheating service is provided without remuneration.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TEQSA) will have the ability to seek court injunctions to force internet service providers and search engines to block cheating websites.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Strict liability will apply to the criminal offence of providing an academic cheating service, in order to undermine services' tactics of disingenuous disclaimers regarding the purpose and use of their products.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">TEQSA will be appointed to enforce the new law, with its powers to include monitoring, intelligence gathering, investigation and prosecution of identified offenders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">TEQSA will have additional power to collect and disseminate information about cheating websites and their users to help institutions combat cheating activity on campus; but with safeguards to protect the unwarranted sharing of personal information about those who purchase cheating materials.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill is aimed squarely at providers of cheating services, and not at students who might use such services. Students who cheat remain subject to their institutions' own academic integrity policies, processes and sanctions. Students who cheat are not subject to the penalties this bill creates; only those who help them cheat are at risk.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The maximum penalties outlined in this bill have deliberately been set high to create a strong deterrent to the provision and promotion of cheating services. Commercial cheating service providers could face up to two years' imprisonment and fines of up to $100,000. Unpaid cheating services could be subject to similar maximum fines but will not be subject to jail time or a criminal record. While these maximum penalties are severe, they are consistent with those for comparable offences such as dealing in fraudulent identity information or knowingly providing false or misleading information or providing a false or misleading document to a Commonwealth entity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has listened carefully to feedback from stakeholders on an Exposure Draft of the bill that was released for comment in April this year. Overall, stakeholders were highly supportive of the need for legislative action to deter this cheating activity. A number of issues were raised that the Government has responded to in the bill now before the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Criminal penalties have been limited to situations where the cheating service or advertising is done for a commercial purpose.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The maximum civil financial penalty has been halved to the same level as for criminal offences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The scope of cheating assistance that is prohibited by the bill has been more tightly defined to where "a substantial part" of an assessment task is undertaken by a third party, not "any part" as in the earlier draft.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Because of this new approach, there was no longer a need to define exemptions to the prohibition – which sought to achieve the same outcome in the earlier draft.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I recognise that some have questioned why this bill seeks to prohibit unpaid cheating assistance. Australian research has shown that a large proportion of third party cheating occurs on an unpaid basis, by friends, family or others in the community. This type of cheating is not only a threat to the integrity of student assessments and of qualifications earned, but in some fields of study – for example in engineering or the health professions – could lead to dangerous or even life threatening situations if students are assumed to have knowledge and skills that they do not possess. It is appropriate to deter this type of cheating. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is not anticipated that many such cases would reach the courts, except in the most serious cases of repeated, deliberate and extensive infractions. The clear intention with this bill is to deter cheating assistance rather than to prosecute friends and family members. And universities' clear preference is to take an educative approach in the first instance where this type of cheating is detected. But it is important that we send a clear signal that cheating in higher education is not just immoral but also illegal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">International education is one of Australia's biggest export industries and this bill demonstrates to potential students, their parents, their governments, and also to overseas employers that Australia takes the quality and integrity of its higher education system and graduates very seriously.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The measures in this bill will help to undermine the business model of commercial cheating service providers, many of which operate as organised criminal enterprises, drawing unsuspecting users in; and in some cases exploiting these victims further with threats of blackmail and exposure to their university, their employer or their family. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The penalties in this bill will significantly change the incentives for commercial operations. The capacity to block cheating websites will make it harder for students in Australia to access these services. We will change not just the conversation about cheating but the incentives to get involved as either a provider or promoter of cheating material.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill will ultimately help to protect the integrity of Australian higher education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I commend the bill.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill will implement the Government's commitment to require large businesses and government enterprises with a total annual income of over $100 million to report on their small business payment terms and times. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are facing unprecedented challenges as we respond to the global COVID-19 pandemic. The global and the domestic economic environment has deteriorated and we now expect the economic shock to be deep, wide, and long. Now, more than ever, we need to support small businesses. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We know that small businesses are the lifeblood of our communities and the backbone of the Australian economy. With the impact of COVID-19 it is even more important that large businesses, as stewards of their supply chains, pay small businesses promptly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Instead, while some large businesses are doing the right thing, others are taking longer to pay their bills, worsening cash flow for small businesses who desperately need the money that they are owed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Prime Minister has been very clear on what large businesses need to do in the current environment. They need to support workers by keeping them employed, with appropriate leave arrangements, as needed. They need to pay small business suppliers promptly, even ahead of time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The actions they take now will say more about those companies, their corporate values and the integrity of their brand, than anything else they've likely done as an organisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Research shows that in 2017-18, payments from large to small business were worth around $281 billion with $77 billion of these payments paid later than 30 days. When payments were paid late, the average length of time for small businesses to be paid was 63 days.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Longer payment times hurt small business cash flow and this harms their ability to hire, invest and grow. Cash-constrained small businesses are often forced to seek out expensive forms of financing in order to sustain their business operations. Late payments also have a flow-on effect across the economy as small businesses paid more slowly, pay their suppliers more slowly in turn.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If all large businesses in Australia paid small businesses within 30 days, it would result in a transfer of working capital from large to small businesses of approximately $7 billion and create an overall net benefit to the Australian economy of $313 million per year and around $2.6 billion over ten years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">With the Commonwealth awarding contracts worth $16.7 billion to small and medium enterprises in 2018-19, the Government recognised it needs to lead the way on good payment practices. That's why we have already adopted a range of measures to improve payment times. Since July 2019, Commonwealth agencies have paid invoices for contracts up to $1 million within 20 calendar days or paid interest on any late payments. This captures approximately 95 per cent of procurement contracts entered into by the Commonwealth. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, from 1 January 2020, e-Invoicing capable Government agencies have paid e-Invoices valued up to $1 million within five days. If they don't, they pay interest. Commonwealth agencies will be progressively coming on board with e‑Invoicing capability throughout 2020. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Now it's time for big business to step up. The Payment Times Reporting Bill will require large businesses to report on how quickly they say they will pay and when they actually pay their small business suppliers. Small business suppliers for the purposes of the scheme are those businesses with an annual turnover of less than $10 million. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Large businesses will also be asked to report on their use of supply chain financing practices. Small businesses need to be armed with information about who they do business with. There are too many incidences of large businesses taking advantage of these arrangements by extending the length of their payment terms, with small businesses being forced to enter into these arrangements where they have to agree to reduce the amount they are paid in order to get paid in a reasonable time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will bring into effect twice yearly reporting for around 3,000 large businesses that are incorporated or have a physical presence in an Australian territory or are foreign businesses that carry on an enterprise in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Commonwealth Corporate Entities and Commonwealth companies who meet the income threshold will also be required to report. Enterprises such as Australia Post and NBN Co. will be required to report their payment practices for the first time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Information from these payment times reports will be made publicly available on the Payment Times Reports Register, creating an incentive for large businesses to improve their payment performance. Transparency of payment terms, times and supply chain financing practices will allow small business and the public to better identify and engage with companies that pay on time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Businesses found to be non-compliant with the reporting requirements of this Bill will be named as such on the publicly available Payment Times Reports Register.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill establishes the Payment Times Reporting Regulator to administer the legislation and monitor and enforce compliance as necessary. The power of the Regulator extends to obtaining and publishing information, monitoring, investigating and enforcing civil penalties, as well as directing an entity to undertake an audit of their payment practices on the reasonable suspicion of wrong doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Significant penalties will be in place to ensure that large businesses comply with the Scheme. Penalties will apply for non-compliance, including failure to report or report accurately. For example, there will be penalties for providing misleading information of up to 0.6% of the annual income of the business. These penalties are designed to reflect the seriousness of the Government's commitment to addressing the issue of payment times and practices. It will ensure small businesses can rely on the information to make decisions about doing business with particular large businesses. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While the core obligations of reporting entities are specified in the Act, more technical and administrative details will be dealt with in the supporting Rules. This means the Rules can respond more flexibly to changing business and industry practices. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill has been informed by and reflects extensive consultation with small and large business as well as industry organisations since early 2019. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I know businesses are always concerned when regulation is introduced that the compliance will be onerous. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The reality is that a culture of longer payment times to suppliers has developed and it is holding us back economically. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We have already seen the benefits of our approach to shine a light on bad payment behaviour. Recently a number of large businesses rapidly abandoned payment practices which negatively impacted on small businesses once they were subject to public scrutiny. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Payment Times Reporting Bill 2020 strikes the right balance of providing transparency for small businesses without creating an unnecessary regulatory burden for businesses both large and small.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">With the impact of COVID-19 it is now more important than ever that large businesses pay small businesses promptly. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These are extraordinary times for all Australians. The Government is acting decisively and responsibly to support the economy to overcome the challenges posed by COVID-19. This Bill reflects the Government's commitment to support small business and ensure that it continues to play a critical role in driving Australia's future economic growth.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll just outline what this motion is about. First, it's noting the bill that the Greens have introduced, the Coronavirus Economic Support and Recovery (No-one Left Behind) Bill 2020. This bill is for an act to provide for a coronavirus economic support and recovery fund. It amends the laws relating to social security and expands eligibility for the JobKeeper scheme and for related purposes. Then we go on to call on the government to make sure that no-one is left behind by the coronavirus health and economic crisis, that we expand the COVID-19 supplement to recipients of the disability support pension and the carer pension and expand jobseeker to people on temporary visas. We also want to make sure that the JobKeeper scheme is expanded to include all casual employees, not just those that have been working with the same employer for 12 months. We want to make sure that employees who hold temporary visas are looked after and not left behind. We want to make sure that intermittent workers are not left behind, nor are higher education providers, and that employees of entities that are owned by foreign governments and that are resident in Australia are not left behind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to make sure that we are investing in a recovery package for the arts sector, which still has not been supported. I'm wondering: has the Prime Minister used the word 'art' when he has talked about the impacts on our economy? We want to make sure that there's money invested in a manufacturing fund—$12 billion. We want to make sure that $6 billion is invested in an electricity transmission fund and $2 billion is invested in grants to the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. All those things are absolutely essential to ensuring that no-one is left behind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to remind the chamber that on 22 May, late on a Friday afternoon—it's when you release all the bad information; the following Friday was the announcement about robodebt and the refund of all those illegal debts—the Treasurer announced that the JobKeeper program would cost $60 billion less than expected. While originally estimated to cost $130 billion over 2019-20 and 2020-21, it was now estimated that it would be closer, in fact, to $70 billion. This was due to a revision down of the numbers of eligible workers from 6.5 million to 3.5 million. The government has not committed to reinvesting that money; in fact, they have attempted to celebrate this underspend as it will mean the Commonwealth will go into less debt. However, I will note that they had originally thought that $130 billion was necessary to invest in our community and economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We now have the perfect opportunity to reallocate that $60 billion underspend both to stop people being left behind in the crisis and to invest in the recovery. We can also link this to the need to make sure that, when we're investing in the recovery, we are actually investing in renewable energies, in the transformation that we know we need to make to address that other global crisis: climate change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said, this bill invests in a number of key areas. It invests in ensuring that no-one is left behind. We want to make sure that people who missed out on the supplement—those on the disability support pension and the carer payment—actually get access to that supplement. We want to make sure that it is available to temporary visa holders, many of whom at the moment basically have to rely on emergency relief and have no money coming in. I have heard many accounts from many people who are stuck here. When the Minister for Finance, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer say 'go home', they can't actually get home. Yes, they made a commitment to support themselves when they came to this country, but that was before this crisis. It was before we had lost so many jobs. As a caring community, we expect that we would look after these people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, we also need to invest in the arts and entertainment industry, and in manufacturing, but we want to see green manufacturing. We want to invest in new electricity transmission infrastructure and in our Australian Renewable Energy Agency. A number of my colleagues will address some significant parts of this particular need to invest in these additional resources, but I particularly want to address the issue of those who have missed out on the supplement—in particular, those on the disability support pension and those receiving the carer payment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">DSP and carer payment recipients have been excluded from the $550 per week supplement. They've been omitted on purpose. The government claims that they didn't extend the coronavirus supplement to people on these payments because they don't face the same financial burdens. That is just a complete and utter fallacy. If anything, disabled people and carers have experienced increased costs throughout this pandemic. A recent survey conducted by People with Disability Australia found that 91 per cent of respondents reported increased expenses over the last two months, mostly related to groceries and food, health care, internet, phone, and hygiene and sanitising equipment. Disabled people are being forced to make the difficult choice between buying medication and PPE and putting food on the table. It is well recognised that 50 per cent of disabled people already live below the poverty line. Now, in the midst of this coronavirus pandemic, additional costs are further entrenching poverty levels and causing stress and anxiety for disabled people and carers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's other excuse for not extending the supplement to these payment recipients is that they don't face the same paid employment impacts as those on jobseeker or youth allowance. Again, this is another fallacy. This is incredibly hypocritical, coming from a government that is constantly trying to force disabled people into work, to the point where it tries to keep them off the disability support pension. Look no further than the program of support which forces disabled Australians to try to find work before they can qualify for the DSP. The government has also had no qualms about requiring disabled Australians to undertake mutual obligations, the phasing back in of which started this week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that many disabled Australians do in fact work and have lost employment opportunities as a result of the recession and the pandemic. For example, the People with Disability Australia survey found that 66 per cent of people had seen changes to their income during the pandemic. People also reported losing their jobs and working fewer hours. Others have had to leave their jobs because they were considered vulnerable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My office has received countless emails and phone calls from people on the DSP and the carer payment who are feeling totally abandoned and forgotten by this government. Here is what one carer who contacted us said: 'I'm a carer and just spent a week in hospital with my son—a lot longer than usually necessary because of complications with his medical device. The complications with the device produced similar symptoms to COVID-19, which meant extra days in hospital, which meant extra money spent. Hospital stay expenses add up really fast, living off expensive hospital takeaway as your only option with a sick child you can't leave and having to buy clothes, toiletries and essential items from the nearest shopping centre to get through because we live a long way from the closest hospital that can treat us.' Another person said: 'It is unfair, and discrimination to exclude DSP carers and seniors out of a big stimulus package, considering these people have higher living expenses already. They say our situation hasn't changed, but, if that's the case, why am I heading out for a fourth time this week to get some simple grocery items? Or why am I forced to pay 100 per cent more just to get simple medical supplies as everybody has nothing?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The World Health Organization has specifically recommended that governments should undertake targeted measures for people with disability and their support networks during this pandemic, including financial compensation for families and caregivers supporting loved ones. I find it deeply distressing that the government is yet again refusing to listen to the community or the experts and not providing adequate support to disabled people and carers. I am sick of the government leaving out entire groups of Australians—leaving them behind. This is a time when we should be sharing and caring for each and every Australian needing additional support as they struggle to make ends meet during a crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should also be supportive and caring for the people who have got stuck here and can't get home. We are a caring and compassionate nation—supposedly! So why are we leaving people behind? I strongly believe that the way to remedy this injustice is to provide the coronavirus supplement to disabled people and carers, and those others whom I have spoken about, such as those on visas. Extending the supplement to these payment recipients recognises that these people will need support. They need more support; people with disability and carers need more support as we move into the recovery period. Disabled people will need to self-isolate and socially distance for longer periods as restrictions are eased, bearing additional costs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I'd like to add a big shout-out to the disabled Australians and carers who have been campaigning for a better outcome. They've been campaigning for justice—for additional payments to meet their needs. To those disabled Australians and carers: you have demonstrated resilience, strength and compassion. Thank you for your efforts to continue to fight for justice. We will continue to support your call to get access to the supplement, to meet your needs and to ensure that you are not left behind.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="287062" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McLACHLAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  I rise to speak against the motion moved by Senator Siewert. The motion asks the Senate to note a bill that they've introduced, and also lays out a series of alternative spending priorities that it seeks to have the government adopt. In my view, there is a part of this motion which is missing, and that's a congratulations—or at least, an acknowledgement—of the stewardship of the Australian economy by the coalition government. If it hadn't been so wise and diligent, we wouldn't have had the money, the funds or the community wealth for all of us here—and, in particular, the Greens—to muse over how to spend it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth reflecting on the unique circumstances that the coalition government has found itself in. It had to make very difficult decisions in a compressed time frame in a period of great uncertainty. I'll take this opportunity to commend the Prime Minister and his cabinet on their outstanding efforts—efforts which have been able to manoeuvre our economy into an excellent place from which it can recover and thrive. I also remind honourable senators that we still live in very uncertain times. We risk another wave of infection and associated greater economic costs—especially so with the potential for widespread infections following the protests, which, I add, the Greens support. It seems a little incongruent to me to support large-scale public gatherings at the same time as contemplating in this place how to spend the money paid by hardworking Australians, who are at risk of a further wave of infection.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All the coalition's decisions have been grounded on its values. We want Australians to live happy, healthy and fulfilling lives, to have an opportunity for personal growth and to fulfil their aspirations. To achieve this, Australians need to have employment opportunities. Employment opportunities derive only from a strong economy. What we do agree with the Greens on is that we do not want to leave any Australian behind. We want to make sure that every Australian has an abundance of pathways to a happy life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion also does not address the role of the states and territories in delivering assistance to their citizens. Each state and territory has an equal obligation in respect of their own community. We must be mindful of the burden we leave for future generations. They need to be considered in this debate. And we need the Greens to tell us what burden our youth will carry if these measures are implemented and parliament passes the bill. What the motion also does not address is who misses out if these suggestions are implemented. This is a luxury of parties not in government. In government you have to take into account all Australians and make difficult decisions that balance competing interests and objectives. What services will be cut to pay for these initiatives? Future generations and our youth will want to know. We cannot go on and restore our economic fortunes as though we were the god of wealth, Plutus, who was blinded by Zeus. We can see. We have the ability to make judgements. As a coalition we've made considered decisions for the benefit of all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I indicated, the Greens motion goes through a number of spending priorities, and I'd like to point out to honourable senators that the coalition government has provided $259 billion, which equates to 13.3. per cent of GDP, to support Australian workers, households and businesses. It's important to note that the government has nearly doubled jobseeker for those who are not eligible for JobKeeper. In relation to those who are receiving social security payments, as of 6 May over $5.1 billion had been paid to more than 6.8 million Australians. From 30 July a further economic support payment of $750 will be paid to approximately five million Australians, including 3.4 million pensioners, 800,000 family tax benefit recipients, 170,000 carer allowance recipients, 230,000 recipients of veteran payments and gold card holders, and 375,000 Commonwealth senior health card holders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The honourable senator who moved the motion made particular reference to those on temporary visas. The Australian government is prioritising Australians and permanent residents—and rightly so. The JobKeeper program is designed to maintain links between employees and employers. This program is designed to keep Australians in jobs for the long term. The Australian government welcomes temporary visas and has, in addition, made a number of changes to help them, including access to their Australian superannuation and more flexible visa conditions. Welfare assistance may also be available to other temporary visa holders if they face significant financial hardship. Supplementary benefits, such as rent assistance, may also be paid. The government has announced $200 million to expand community services to support vulnerable people, which includes assistance for paying bills and buying other essentials, such as food, clothing and petrol.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I now wish to come to higher education, which is referred to in the motion that has been moved. The government has committed to providing universities with $18 billion this year. The government is also guaranteeing the Commonwealth Grant Scheme and other funding streams for higher education providers at their current levels for the rest of 2020, and 2020 performance based funding for public universities will also be guaranteed. Universities can be eligible for JobKeeper in the same way that not-for-profits are.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will now turn to arts and entertainment, which was the subject of much debate earlier today in this place. Two hundred of the largest Australian council funded arts organisations receive more than $95 million under JobKeeper. Opera Australia has 473 employees who are eligible. The Australian Ballet has 238 employees who are eligible. The Sydney Symphony Orchestra has 153 employees who are eligible. Queensland Ballet has 144 employees who are eligible. The Melbourne Theatre Company, the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Australian Ballet, among a number of other arts organisations, have called JobKeeper a lifesaver. The Bureau of Communications and Arts Research values the arts sector at $112 billion and has found more than 90 per cent of people in the sector had employment arrangements that meant they could receive JobKeeper. Creative and performing arts jobs make up 0.3 per cent of all jobs in the economy. Their share of JobKeeper recipients is three times higher at 0.9 per cent. Only three per cent of casual workers are from the arts and recreation services sector, compared with 20 per cent for accommodation and food services and 15 per cent for retail.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has announced a $27 million targeted support package for areas of the cultural and creative sector, which includes $7 million for the Indigenous Visual Arts Industry Support program, $10 million to provide crisis relief to artists, crews, music and live-performance workers and $10 million for artists and arts organisations in regional Australia for the Regional Arts Fund. Other government measures for the arts sector include cash flow support, which is worth more than $23 million. Modelling by the Australia Council estimates the JobKeeper payment will make available in excess of $100 million of additional funding for arts organisations funded under the national partnership agreement or for those that receive four-year funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That range of initiatives, which is not comprehensive, indicates the commitment of the coalition government to the welfare of its citizens. When reflecting on responding to the motion moved by Senator Siewert, I recalled a quote from an American senator. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… priorities are reflected in the things we spend money on. Far from being a dry account of bookkeepers, a nation's budget is full of moral implications; it tells what a society cares about and what it does not care about; it tells what its values are.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And that is what we are really debating here today. The coalition's values are plain for all to see: create employment opportunities for all Australians by creating the conditions for a vibrant economy to thrive. I oppose the motion.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WALSH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:22</span>):  It is clear that too many Australians are currently being left behind by the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic crisis it has caused. Throughout the crisis, Labor has worked responsibly and constructively with the government, but, at the same time, we've not been afraid to call them out where they've fallen short. Our priority has always been to protect jobs and help workers, their families and the businesses that employ them through this crisis. Our priority has been to look out for vulnerable Australians and ensure that they are supported properly. We have fought for those priorities here in the parliament. The Greens know this and the Greens have seen this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion and the Greens' bill it refers to will not make sure that workers get the extra support they need, and the Greens know that too, because we all know that the Senate cannot introduce bills for the government appropriation of funding. We also know that the government already have the power to extend support to those missing out. It was Labor's work that gave them that authority, and we have been calling loudly for them to use it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we move into our first recession for 29 years, it's clear right now that too many Australians are missing out on the support they need during this recovery. Throughout the pandemic and the economic crisis, the government have consistently told us how we're all in this together, how their approach to support the community was equal and how it didn't favour some over others. They more recently told us that they would not leave anyone behind. These are the words of the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison: 'We will not leave the vulnerable behind.' He is a Prime Minister that says one thing and then does another. One day, we're all in this together, and then, the next, millions of workers are excluded from JobKeeper. One day, it's guaranteed that JobKeeper will be there to support workers until September, and, the next, they are ripping JobKeeper away from 120,000 early childhood educators.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The worst thing about these moves is that they almost always overwhelmingly impact the poorest Australians and the most vulnerable Australians. Either the government are not aware of the impacts of their policy decisions or they don't care. I'm not sure which is worse: an incompetent government or a government that lacks compassion? Perhaps it's both. While a lot of their decisions scream a lack of care for our lowest-paid workers and our most vulnerable Australians, their implementation of those decisions just screams incompetence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">JobKeeper is a case in point. It's an excellent idea. It's a scheme that the Labor Party, the union movement and workers had to fight for, and it's a scheme which, to its credit, has helped millions of Australians stay in their jobs. But JobKeeper could have and should have helped millions more. The government's execution of JobKeeper was bad. This is a good program with poor implementation, exemplified by the largest budgeting blunder in Australia's history—$60 billion of budget blundering. That $60 billion could have been used to roll out JobKeeper to the millions of workers that they excluded from the scheme, workers who they excluded because at the time they said they just had to draw the line somewhere. Well, they found an extra $60 billion and what did they do? Include more workers? No. They did the opposite and they excluded even more people than were already excluded from the program. I'm referring to the 120,000 early childhood educators whom they've just said will be excluded from JobKeeper in coming weeks. Instead of targeting the scheme at those who really need it, they excluded more people. They could have targeted it at casuals, freelancers, temporary migrants, NDIS workers, university staff, arts and performance workers, local government employees, the many charity workers, international students and so many more who are missing out. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For months, Labor has been calling on the government to take action and, for months, Labor has been calling on the government to extend the wage subsidy to include workers that they have so heartlessly excluded. We know that the impacts these exclusions will have on people, and on their employers as well, will be absolutely devastating. These impacts are happening right now, in real time, to real people. You only have to look at the university sector to see what these exclusions mean for jobs. We know that 21,000 jobs are at risk if the government do not step in to support universities during this difficult period—21,000 livelihoods that Australian families rely on—and yet the government seem to barely even acknowledge that this is the risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we're seeing the results of their inaction, because we're watching universities cut back on courses and degrees, close campuses and shed jobs. There are 400 university jobs that are about to be lost in Geelong in my home state of Victoria, and the government is letting this happen, right in the middle of our first recession in almost 30 years. These are exactly the jobs that these regional communities need. Regional Australia need these university jobs, which often help underpin their local economies. We're talking about a range of employees in these universities—tutors, academics, catering staff, cleaners, security officers, library staff, administration staff, ground staff and many more. These are all people who have to support themselves and people who have families to support. They have bills to pay and food to put on the table.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Families will be wondering not why the government didn't act to save their jobs but why the government actively went out of their way to exclude these workers. What is it that the government has against particular groups of Australian workers? What is it that the government has against university sector staff? The irony is that it's universities and their medical researchers, health researchers and other staff who right now are helping to see us through this health crisis and plan a way out of it for the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You only have to look at the hospitality sector or the arts and entertainment sector to see businesses that are shutting every day and thousands upon thousands of workers losing their jobs. Some of these jobs and businesses could have been saved if the government did not actively exclude these workers, these sectors, these businesses from the JobKeeper program. But they did exclude them. They excluded so many people, including over one million casuals. I don't know if those on the government benches realise it, but the decision to exclude so many people has actual, real-life consequences. This is not about numbers and statistics; it's about people, their families and their lives. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past few months, I've been talking to workers who've been impacted by coronavirus and those that have been excluded from JobKeeper—workers like Jason. Jason is a Kiwi living here in Australia. He's made his life here; he's been here for years. But, since the coronavirus crisis started, many aspects of the life that he's tried to build here have fallen apart. His employers won't claim JobKeeper for their workers, because of their concerns around cash flow, and Jason can't get jobseeker because of his New Zealand citizenship. As a result, many people like Jason who've come to Australia to make a life are being forced into dire situations, with often their only option being to raid their retirement savings by accessing their superannuation. Jason is a case in point. He's had to pull $1,500 from his super and he's really worried that he'll have to access more. If he's forced to access the limit of $10,000, Jason could be up to $90,000 worse off when he retires. How is that fair? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What about Darcy? Darcy has been mentioned in this chamber before. He's been working in hospitality for over 15 years, making him an absolute hospo veteran. He has had to move back in with his parents at the age of 30, which certainly wasn't part of his plan, but it was his only option. Despite those 15 years, he has been a casual at his most recent employer for less than 12 months. He's never been unemployed in his adult life but, because of the transient nature of hospitality work, technically he'd been employed for just a few months by his current boss, which made him ineligible for the JobKeeper scheme under the government's guidelines. That meant that he could no longer pay his bills, pay his rent and be independent. At the age of 30, he's had to move back in with his parents to survive. Darcy said that missing out on JobKeeper was, in his own words, 'gut-wrenching'. And Darcy considers himself to be one of the lucky ones. He knows that some of his colleagues and friends who were employed in the hospitality sector are unable to stay with family or friends—they don't have those support networks. It's a grim reality and one that this government is allowing to happen by its refusal to include casual workers like Darcy in the JobKeeper program. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there's the example of temporary migrant workers who are really in the most dire circumstances of all because of this government's decision to draw a line to exclude them. Take the case of Giovanni. He's a temporary migrant worker and an international student. He, too, moved here with the hope of building a better life, like so many migrants to this country before him. He has been studying for a Master of Education and working 20 hours a week in hospitality, but because of the COVID-19 shutdown his hours were cut right back and he is struggling to pay the rent. His partner is due to give birth any day now to their first child.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Giovanni has spent years in Australia, contributing, working, studying, paying taxes, pay uni fees and being everything that he can to be a valued member of our community. He put it well when he said, 'We're not asking much; we pay tax, you know—we're just asking for a little bit of relief.' But the government's response to Giovanni and others in a similar situation was to say, 'Just go home.' How absolutely outrageous! When we spoke about the government's response to those in his situation, this is a man who actually broke down in tears. Giovanni said that this was one of the most heartbreaking moments in his life, because he'd done everything to be included as a valued member of our community. But this government decided to specifically exclude him from the JobKeeper program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Giovanni, Darcy and Jason deserve to have a government that supports them in times of crisis and in times of hardship. These exclusions from JobKeeper will have contributed to the fact that there are more people on the jobseeker payment than was predicted at the beginning of this crisis: 200,000 more Australians are currently on jobseeker than predicted. And we can expect this number to grow even more, to 1.7 million by September. But what's the plan come September for these people who have lost their jobs because of a global pandemic? The government's current plan is, as we all know, to snap back unemployment benefits to the previous Newstart rates—rates which are so low that they trap people in poverty and actually prevent them from doing something that the government talks so much about: finding employment. This is not a great idea in the middle of a recession.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to be helping to support people while they find a way to get back to work, and that means making sure people can afford the essentials that they need: training, tools, transport, clothing and being able to keep a car on the road. These are not possible on the old Newstart rates. Too many people are falling through the cracks in the government's support, and it sounds like they are going to let the same thing happen to those on JobKeeper in September. This snapback is going to hurt families, hurt businesses and hurt the economy, and the government has the power, because of our advocacy, to help support these Australians with the flick of a pen.</span>

                  <a href="JKM" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKIM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:37</span>):  Before I go to the substance of this debate, I would just like to address something that Senator Walsh said in her speech. She expressed concerns about appropriating funds. In fact, we're not actually debating an appropriation here. We're debating what to do with money that has actually already been appropriated. So if that's the only excuse that the Labor Party has for not supporting the Greens this evening then they can rest assured that in fact that's not a concern. They can set their minds at rest and, as I said, if that's their only excuse for not supporting us then we now look forward to their support for this motion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we do know is that the Treasurer announced, late on a Friday afternoon—when you take out the trash in Australian politics—that the JobKeeper program would cost $60 billion less than expected. When you say it quickly, $60 billion doesn't sound like a lot of money, but, believe me, that is an awful lot of money that could be put to an awful lot of good uses! Unfortunately for so many people, and for our economy, the government has not committed to reinvest the money. In fact they are effectively celebrating this underspend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Greens have a diametrically opposed position, and that is that this is $60 billion of forgone economic stimulus. We also believe that the government making the decision not to spend this money will massively impact on so many people who desperately need support. There is a range of people who I would include in that category: many artists and creative workers; so many temporary visa holders, including international students; casual workers who have worked less than 12 months continuously for their current employer; and people who work for universities. The list goes on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But here's what the Greens are proposing: expand JobKeeper eligibility to casual employees, including those casual employees currently not eligible due to less than 12 months of continuous service with their current employer. We also would like to see it extended to employees on temporary visas. We'd like to see it expanded to include intermittent employees, who've missed out due to the fixed 1 March start date and the nature of their contracts. We'd also like to see it expanded to cover employees of higher education providers such as universities, which have been explicitly excluded from JobKeeper, through adjustments to their turnover test. We'd also like to see it expanded to employees of foreign government owned entities that are resident in Australia—the example being dnata, an airport services provider that is 100 per cent owned by the state government of Dubai; it has been excluded from JobKeeper on that basis. Outside the JobKeeper program, we also have plenty of people in this country who are on Newstart and who need to have the rate of Newstart retained so that people are not condemned to live a life of abject poverty. There are a range of really important measures that could be taken by this government in regard to that $60 billion which would not only stimulate the economy but massively improve the opportunity for so many people to actually live a good life in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk a little bit about temporary visa holders. I well recall the Prime Minister flippantly saying to temporary visa holders early on in the pandemic, 'It's time to go home.' He said it was time to go home, ignoring the fact that, for many temporary visa holders, this was simply not an option at the time, and it remains not an option for them today. This is like inviting some guests around to your home and then, when the going gets a little bit tough, booting them out on the street. Temporary visa holders are guests in our country. We've asked them to come in. We ought to be showing them hospitality. We ought to be supporting them in these really, really difficult times, and the sight of international students forming long queues in some of our capital cities over the last month or two has been absolutely heart-wrenching. These people have basically been kicked out onto the street and left to starve by this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I make the point that when, a few years ago, the government cut the SRSS payment, the Status Resolution Support Services payment, for people seeking asylum in this country, when they cut them off from housing support and employment support and when they cut them off from social security payments, that set the tone. The government thought, 'We've gotten away with that one, so let's see if we can get away with it again.' Well, they won't get away with it while the Australian Greens remain in this place to be a voice for so many of those people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, there are people on protection visas, whom I just spoke about. There are international students, people on working visas and people on visitor visas who may be stuck here either due to a lack of funds or as a result of travel bans that prevent them from leaving Australia and returning to a safe country. The government's response to temporary visa holders in Australia during this pandemic has been cruel and callous. They've been sentenced to poverty, hunger and destitution by a government that just simply doesn't care about their welfare, despite inviting them into our country as our guests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We'd expect other countries to look after Australians who are stuck over there and unable to return to Australia, so why aren't we doing better at looking after foreign nationals who are guests in our country during a very difficult time for people around the world? There are currently over two million people who hold valid temporary visas to be in Australia, and the government has a responsibility to provide income support at a time like this for those people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to take this opportunity to issue a warning. What we are facing is as plain as day: we are going to see a massive effort of austerity from this government. They will say: we need to cut the budget to put it back in balance. Now, let's leave aside for a minute the argument about whether that is actually true or not. We know we're staring down the barrel of deep austerity because that's the only way the Liberals know. They're going to gut our public services. They're going to turn public debt into private debt for people who cannot afford to carry that debt. They're going to punish people who need support, just as they have for so many years, by keeping the Newstart payment so low, and they are going to drive more people into destitution and despair. And they're going to do it despite the fact that so many major corporations in this country who profit so obscenely in Australia still pay little or, in many cases, no tax whatsoever. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're going to see it, despite the fact that every budget that is handed down contains over $20 billion in direct subsidies to people who burn fossil fuels in the middle of a climate emergency. We're going to see let-it-rip environmental destruction to fatten the profits of the environmental vandals, whether they be the coalminers, the gas frackers or the native forest destroyers. You watch: this public money will be shovelled into those companies and those corporations so they can maintain their obscene profit levels while nature, as ever, pays such a heavy price. We'll see tax dodgers being given more chances to avoid paying what they owe. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia, the people of Australia and the Australian environment cannot afford the pain of the looming Liberal austerity agenda. And we need to fight against this austerity because of the harm it will cause to so many people who are struggling, to so many people who need support. There are many other ways, as I alluded to earlier: making big corporations pay their fair share of tax; ending the rampant fossil fuel subsidies that exist in every budget. If the Liberals are so concerned about balancing a budget, I encourage them to force the big fossil fuel companies and the big corporates in this country to pay their fair share of tax. In fact, I do more than encourage them; I demand that that is what they do. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do have an opportunity to reimagine this country. We do have an opportunity to make sure that we don't go back to the way it used to be, because the way it used to be was so bad and so difficult for so many people. And when we reimagine what Australia could look like, we can think about what a green new deal would look like for this country—a green new deal which has, as a foundation, respect for nature and significant government investment to improve the lives of people and to start to repair some of the massive environmental harm that has been caused for so many decades in this country—and create jobs, wealth and opportunity for people while we do it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are the opportunities before us, colleagues. Those are the opportunities that we should seize collectively now, because we can do things better than we did them before. The Australian Greens don't want to see us go back to exactly the way it used to be, because, as I said, the way it used to be was simply too hard, too difficult, for too many people. So let's work collectively to seize those opportunities. Let's work collectively to make sure that, as we do provide that economic stimulus, it's in areas where we can use those funds, those $60 billion that are now available, that we thought we would have to spend but now know that we don't. Let's use them to repair nature. Let's use them to protect nature. Let's use them to reforest and rewild. Let's use them to create jobs, wealth and opportunity for more people. Let's use them to support so many Australians who've done it far too tough for far too long.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:50</span>):  It's great to be here at this late hour on Friday afternoon and to be able to speak on a subject that I actually care really deeply about. I rise to speak on this general business debate on the motion put forward by Senator Siewert. As with most debates brought forward by the Greens, I thank her for the opportunity to make this contribution, because there is nothing precedented about these challenging times. We are delivering for all Australians, so it's safe to say that I reject the premise of the motion and some of the comments made in this debate. Yet again, when Australians expect more of us in this place, when they expect us to be working together here to get through this challenge and deliver for them, those opposite continue to drive division.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a government, we've put in place the broadest possible support package, which touches every sector of the Australian economy and the individuals who participate in it. We're providing an unprecedented safety net for business and keeping Australians connected to their employers. For those who have been stood down, there are a range of support measures that are available. We're ensuring Australian families can continue to pay the bills and can continue, as much as possible, to carry on with their lives. These measures do not discriminate by industry; they are the most comprehensive support package that has ever been delivered by government, and the principles which underpin our economic response to the coronavirus challenge are sound.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike those opposite, when confronted with the GFC, we have avoided grand new schemes. We've avoided picking winners. We've seen and learned from the lessons of their mismanagement. The actions of those opposite when they were in government and in partnership with the Greens have provided the perfect textbook of what not to do when you're responding to an economic challenge, and we need to recognise that, both going into this challenge and coming out of it, the government has created an environment which has consistently seen job creation. It continued to drive investment and deliver better outcomes for all Australians. And we do this not by penalising industry for its existence, as those opposite would have us do; we do this by ensuring that Australians keep more of their own money, whereas you would see that those opposite would rather see us fill up the government coffers. We do this by providing equality of opportunity, where, again, those with an ideological disposition would see us do it without creating equality of outcome. This general business debate is meant to be about ensuring that no-one is left behind, but it is a perfect demonstration of picking winners as they continue to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I don't come to this debate from a position of ideological blindness; I come to it from getting out there and speaking to Western Australian people, people in my home state who have been impacted by this coronavirus situation. I've heard some wonderful stories of how people are getting ahead, but I've also, of course, heard some really challenging tales. One business that I spoke to is actually doing quite well. They're a plumbing business, and because people are staying at home, they're recognising the areas of maintenance in their homes that need to be fixed, so this particular plumbing business is booming. It's amazing. But then you speak to others that, because of the particular nature of the work they do, are really struggling. But the safety net has been there for them and for their employees to ensure that those jobs can continue in the best possible way. I've seen great displays of innovation, ingenuity and reinvention. I've also seen examples of businesses and individuals that, through no fault of their own, have suffered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through my conversations and hours of Zoom meetings, I've listened to the impact of the government's economic response. One such business was Alba Edible Oils in Perth's southern suburbs. JobKeeper has had a significant impact on their business. When the coronavirus pandemic first hit, they were deeply worried about what it would mean for them and their employees. Their business is simple: they supply cooking oils to the hospitality industry across the country. They ship these oils right across the country and even overseas. Given that restaurants were closed, the demand simply was not there for their products. It's a classic demonstration of how the impacts of coronavirus have flowed through the supply chain of impacted industries, particularly those that are service focused. If those employees had been stood down, they would have lost that connection to their employer. That connection is critical because this is a unique business. Their operations are unique. There are not many businesses like this in the country, so they spend a lot of time, energy and resources on training their staff. Their staff, they say, are excellent at what they do. Many of them have been with that company for a very, very long time and have built great skills, delivering for that business and for themselves. Losing them because of the coronavirus challenge would have had a significant impact upon this business because of the effort in getting restarted. When restaurants and other businesses started to reopen, their ability to restart would have been significantly impacted if they had lost their staff. Getting them back may have been too difficult.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How I came to be connected with this business is relevant to this debate. It, along with a number of other businesses in Perth's southern suburbs that I visited, was a beneficiary of a Manufacturing Modernisation Fund grant. They received $100,000 from the government to double the production of a number of their products. This meant that more jobs were supported and more and more export opportunities would be available to them. Another business just down the road, Beurtreaux, recently received quite a significant grant of $932,000 to integrate advanced technology into their manufacturing process. This company supplies seats for marine applications right around the world—for superferries and the Sydney ferries. In fact, they made most of the seats that are on the Transperth train system. It is an amazing company that uses advanced manufacturing. We're supporting Australia's manufacturing industry to ensure that businesses like this are able to use this period of the coronavirus challenge, when things are slow, to take advantage of the instant asset write-offs, other stimulus payments and other programs to enable them to build and establish themselves so that they can be stronger going forward. We're recognising that these businesses are important for our sovereign capability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are just two examples. If I had more time available to me, I'd be able to give you many more examples of businesses that have benefited from the support that the government has given them. You can look on my Facebook page if you're interested in seeing some of those. I've been visiting them and posting details of the work that they're doing. There are some fine examples of businesses that have taken the best possible advantage they can of this coronavirus challenge. Many of them have been able to do that because of the JobKeeper program, which has kept their people connected to their business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've never been as proud as I am right now, sitting on this side of the chamber, having seen what the Morrison government has done. The Morrison government has delivered incredible leadership at this time. The actions of this government have demonstrated real leadership, which was so necessary and which is absolutely vital for us as we go forward. Not everything has been perfect. That's what you could expect when you're delivering a program on a scale such as that of JobKeeper, which needed to be developed in a very short space of time. From when it was announced through to when it was actually delivered, including the passage of the legislation, it was a matter of weeks. What was able to be delivered is amazing. But there were some challenges. We've been working through them. We've implemented a review that's taking place right now, and there will be further things to say about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In those early days of the JobKeeper program, I, like many colleagues and others in this place, had the opportunity to provide feedback to various ministers that were working on the JobKeeper program with the expectations of the Australian public and the business community. This was when Australia was venturing into the unknown and the unpredictable in both an economic and a health sense. We really didn't know where this was all going. It's remarkable what Australians and, in particular, Western Australians have done. What we've been able to do together as a state and as a nation in suppressing the health concern is quite remarkable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the circumstances have changed, and the government have continued to listen, respond and adapt in recognition of the rapidly changing environment that we've found ourselves in, and we will continue to do so. Our aims have been crystal clear. The priority has been to get the economy back on track and to get people back into work. It is our singular focus. It is the singular focus of our Prime Minister. We are singularly focused on creating the jobs that are necessary to get people off welfare and back into work. I acknowledge that, as part of this, people from different backgrounds and organisations, and who hold various philosophies and opinions, have come together with that singular aim. People have had to work together. Many of them wouldn't work together in the past but are now doing so. We are a better nation for it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we on this side of the chamber—and, indeed, some of those directly opposite—have done is use this crisis as a mechanism to ensure there's unity and to ensure that we can push ahead with what is needed for the Australian people. But, sadly, too many in this place use this situation to push an ideological barrow. I suggest that the Greens, in particular, need to take a lesson from this. This is a time to provide feedback, to work together and to be constructive. It's not a time for grievance and ideological blindness. We know we have much more to do. They would do well to work with us to find the support that is necessary for Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The same principles which have underpinned our economic strength entering into this challenge will support us out of it. We will continue with our job-creating agenda. We will continue to support our manufacturing industry, to open up new opportunities for them to create the sovereign capability that we need. We will continue with our investment in reliable and cost-effective sources of energy whilst ensuring we uphold and exceed our international obligations. And we will continue to support people as they get back to work, along with the businesses who employ them, irrespective of what industry they belong to. If it leads to a job, creates a job or is a job then we will back it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="I0T" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:03</span>):  Labor's approach to the COVID crisis has been to put the national interest very clearly first. We have firmly acknowledged from the outset that we are in a health crisis and an economic crisis. So, when those opposite interject and say, 'What have you done?' we have very clearly put out the call for what we think is in the best interest of our nation and we have worked with this government as best we can. That is, I must say, having been there back in 2008, the polar opposite of their conduct during the global financial crisis. I find that just an incredible statement when, day after day, we have this government refusing to take responsibility for the nation's current debt levels—and signal that as some kind of virtue—while it finger points back in time at the same time as it tries to trump up its credentials for stimulating the economy in this current economic crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have not been obstructive; we've been playing a constructive role in helping the government make genuine improvement to its response to the crisis. I know that the Greens motion this afternoon expressed their own intent in that regard. The government has sometimes listened and sometimes it has not. It has not listened to us, and others in the community, when we have alerted the government to those who are very much being left behind in this crisis. In some cases, the government has not really had its ear to the ground in terms of the way people have been affected, and those people missing out have been accidental. But in many cases it has been absolutely deliberate. We've given this government the opportunity to fix these problems, like JobKeeper, where the bill that we passed in this place has the flexibility for this government to step up and do its job properly—to get in and help those Australians who desperately need its support now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government's very delayed response to the outbreak needlessly pushed many Australians out of jobs and into the unprecedented and lengthy queues that we've seen outside Centrelink offices right around the country. Indeed, there have been overloaded call centres, and this has been a very distressing experience for many. Some of those workers have now come back onto JobKeeper and they might now be in the invidious situation of having to work out how they go about paying back their jobseeker payments. But too many Australian workers have been left out. Too many have been found ineligible for JobKeeper, and this government has absolutely failed to support them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have pointed out their view on who is being left behind in their motion this afternoon. This government is failing to support those people. It has had the opportunity to support the 5½ thousand aviation workers at dnata, and it has not taken it. These are Australian workers who are supporting other Australian industries, but, because of the ownership structure, the government hasn't supported them. The government has chosen to support Rex, a foreign-owned airline, with a big injection of cash to keep it flying, but it has refused to do the same for Virgin. Virgin is critically important to regional routes in my home state of Western Australia. The workers at dnata are just like any other workers: they're paying their taxes, they're supporting their families, they're trying to pay their mortgages and they're trying to pay their bills. I have spoken to dnata workers in Western Australia about their distress. The government has had every opportunity to fix this—to extend support to them—but it has rejected these calls. Marion Harris from Cabin Services Australia has said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">But please, we're forgotten workers. Look at the people behind me. Look at the thousands across Australia. There are so many airport workers, essential workers. I'm on the front line.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask: why won't the government help these forgotten workers—these Australian workers who are being left behind?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are 1.1 million casual workers who are missing out. They missed out on JobKeeper and, in many instances, if they didn't qualify for JobKeeper—the government hasn't given them access to JobKeeper, because it has deemed they haven't been in their current employment for long enough—then the government has said, 'Okay, go onto jobseeker.' As I said, jobseeker isn't available to everyone. If you have a working spouse and you are above the income payment thresholds for jobseeker payments, you're not eligible for either JobKeeper or jobseeker. This is incredibly difficult, because the fact is that it is largely women who have lost these jobs and it puts them in the situation in that household where it's their superannuation account that's no longer being topped up and it's their family budget that now has to deal with full fee payments for child care re-emerging in a few weeks time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister thinks we're going to have a snapback in the economy. There are a few things we absolutely cannot snap back to. We cannot snap back to jobseekers living on $40 a day. The number of people on the jobseeker payment is currently 200,000 more than the government planned—and I note that the government expects this to grow to 1.7 million people by September. So, when you want to snap back, you've really got to recognise that this unemployment benefit is absolutely too low at its previous rate. If you do that, you can be absolutely clear that it will have a jarring impact on the economy because the amount of money being spent will just shrink again overnight, as will many household incomes, as they already have done. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians won't be able to afford the essentials to get ready for work—clothing, training tools, transport—or mortgages. The rate of this payment currently called jobseeker was absolutely disgustingly low before the coronavirus crisis hit, and we are calling on you not to reduce payments back to this old rate. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People on DSP and carers have missed out, and this is also an absolutely terrible oversight. We know that 90 per cent of people with disability have faced increased expenses due to the coronavirus, but you didn't increase their payments. Energy costs, extra transport costs because they've had to avoid public transport—all of these things have very much impacted on their daily expenses. They've had home delivery charges, have been missing out on shopping at the markets for specials, and extra health costs have all abounded. We've seen many people fall through the cracks, and people with disability and carers have been forgotten again in the midst of this crisis. Despite the two $750 economic support payments to people on the DSP, it is a lower payment rate than people on jobseeker when the coronavirus supplement is taken into account. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that many carers are also being left in situations where they're worse off, particularly if they're caring for children with a disability. And I note that, while people receive a carer payment, they might even still be doing a little bit of work which they might also have lost in the current crisis. In particular, people who care for children with disability might be more likely to undertake casual work that they're able to say yes or no to, even if they've been working consistently and otherwise would have been eligible if they'd been in permanent work for a JobKeeper payment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor was very pleased to be able to secure changes to the stimulus package so that this government can fix these problems with the stroke of a pen. We call on the government today in this debate on the Greens motion to use these powers to provide the extra support for people with disability and carers who've been left worse off. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another example I want to draw attention to today is the very important university sector. Again, as with the arts, this government wilfully leaves out such a critical part of our economy, watching thousands and thousands of jobs disappear right at a time when we need to be recasting ourselves as a clever and smart nation ready to invest in the skills that we need to come out of this crisis. But you've decided that this isn't important. Investing in early education, schools, TAFE or universities—that is an incredibly important economic imperative at this time. Instead you've taken an axe to education when trying to reinvigorate a struggling economy. I really don't understand what you're trying to do here. Are you trying to ask the university sector to run a marathon with a broken leg? We are going to need to call on this sector to come out of this crisis with the skills, education and resilience that our nation needs. Instead, because of the decline in international students and the chaos that that has brought, you have absolutely failed to support them with JobKeeper or other payments while you have bailed out other parts of the economy with those payments. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, it highlights that this government has absolutely no gender lens. The Prime Minister has said, 'Look, we understand that this economic crisis is impacting more on women than on men.' But instead what does this government do? It targets JobKeeper and biases stimulus payments to the areas in which more men then women are likely to have been employed. I have no problem with the stimulus going to areas like construction, but I have a very big problem with your withdrawal of support from child care. The government's claimed that it has given other top-up payments, but these top-up payments are not the equivalent of JobKeeper. Analysis shows that there is likely to still be a gap with the JobKeeper payments. If JobKeeper's only supposed to be used where there's been a 30 per cent decline in income and revenue, why not leave them in place? Why not leave JobKeeper in place for those services? If what you say is right and the other policy settings are adequate then these centres won't need to call on JobKeeper. So what's the harm leaving it in place?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the party that has endlessly bragged about its credentials in regional Australia. But the minute there were imminent job losses, with a solution in front of you, you have gone into hiding. These are the university sectors that have supported regional communities right around the nation. Instead, you are at: the free market will save jobs. We have tens of thousands of livelihoods being left behind. It is a terrible state of affairs for our nation. The Morrison government haven't explained to this parliament why a university student working a $100 shift per week receives the full $1,500 JobKeeper wage subsidy while a university worker with kids is not eligible for any extra support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here is what you should do: take your $60 billion accounting error and do the decent thing and step up to save Australian jobs. The government has said they would do the right thing and stimulate the economy. Are you going to stimulate it? Are you not going to stimulate it? Are you pulling out or are you staying in? Please give the economy life. Talk about turning the economy on, not letting it go limp.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do detect a sort of more political ploy at play here. If we go back through the work of this parliament in respect of JobKeeper and jobseeker, it was the Labor Party's work in the parliament that provided the amendments which allowed the social services minister to provide support to others who'd been excluded from JobKeeper, jobseeker and other appropriate social security payments with the stroke of a pen. That spirit of unity that we started out with in this pandemic appears to have evaporated. But it is true that the social services minister can ameliorate some of the unintended outcomes in this particular set of circumstances, unprecedented circumstances, which we face.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion and the Greens' bill would do nothing to ensure that Australian workers and businesses get the support they need, because, as every senator knows, we can't appropriate finance in this chamber. Everybody knows that we can't appropriate finance in this chamber. So what we really need to do is keep focusing on the areas of concern, and the areas of concern are myriad. There are a number of really important sectors where people are doing it extremely tough. One of those areas, which my colleague Senator Pratt touched on, is dnata.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a world where Qantas is getting subsidies to run flights, Qantas is getting $75 million to do international relocations, Virgin is getting $70-odd million to do flights and subsidies, and they are also getting JobKeeper, there are 5,400 workers in the same sector getting zero. I've heard the passionate stories of workers in that sector in South Australia in recent times. One woman's story is tragic but quite common in this sector. Her husband had been made redundant at Christmas and she had taken increased hours to fill that gap in the family income. Then along came the pandemic and the shutdown of dnata. They were promised jobseeker and they were on jobseeker, but with the stroke of a pen they were off jobseeker. Now they are five months into having no income. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not easy to qualify for jobseeker. It's fine for people to say, 'You can go on jobseeker.' I challenge anybody to try to get on it. You virtually have to prove destitution. You have to have no savings or anything. It is not just the case that, if you cannot get JobKeeper, you can get jobseeker. Nothing can be further from the truth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The real intent and good stuff in JobKeeper is connection with an employer. Anybody who knows anything about the airline industry would realise that there are over 60 million domestic passenger flights a year. Up until March there were about 59 million of them, and then they almost completely stopped. If you look at the air traffic movement indicator in Australia, you'll see passenger activity up and down the Pilbara and the rest of the place is almost silent. If you really want to kickstart the economy again and snap back, bounce back or even crawl back, you have to keep these people connected with their employer. If you don't do that, they have to go somewhere else or do something else to survive and you are going to incur more economic demise. We understand this. We'll continually point to the gaps and point to the fact that the social services minister could ameliorate this damage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I listened to the ABC on the way home last time I left this place. The stuff in Bendigo and in the university sector in regional towns is appalling. If you take 400 jobs out of Bendigo, Shepparton or the like, that will be catastrophic to those regional communities. The philosophical position this government has taken on the university sector is quite mystifying. Over the 29 years of uninterrupted economic growth you can point to the education sector, the intake of international students and the fact that more Australians are getting well-trained, experience and degrees in regional areas, whereas before there were low-paid jobs and low outcomes in terms of productivity. With the education sector in regional Australia going well, the whole area booms. We're taking 400 jobs out of those sectors. It's quite mystifying.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You get conservative commentators say: 'I don't know what has happened to the Public Service. There is no accountability anymore.' These are conservative commentators. Someone managed to give advice that was catastrophically wrong. Senator Cormann bats up every day and keeps putting on a fine front and all the rest of it, but it was catastrophic advice they were given. They have the opportunity to fine-tune this excellent program—and JobKeeper is an excellent program. I have seen firsthand it work in a small business and it has done exactly what the government wanted it to do. It did have a few warts in that it overpaid a few people—it gave people who only ever worked one Sunday basically $750—but that will wash out. They have an opportunity to fine-tune it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Someone made a catastrophic recommendation and has paid no penalty. No-one has taken the hit for that. No-one has said, 'Look, I got that so wrong that I think I'd better tender my resignation.' That used to be how the Public Service worked. I don't think anybody has ever made such a historically large blunder, and apparently it was just at the upper end of estimates, and apparently the fact that people put '1,500 employees' on a taxation form was not checked. The Taxation Office, I must say, has been extremely diligent in checking every detail of my tax return for every year that I've put one in, and I've never ever found them not to be entirely correct. But, in this circumstance, I really can't explain it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's becoming exceedingly clear: you can use this program, as large as it is, to get better economic outcomes. If you were to let it go till September and turn off the tap, and if you were to try to reduce the people on jobseeker to half of their current income in September, that is not going to have a very sensible economic outcome, because, for once, people on jobseeker can actually afford to buy some clothes and can probably afford to get their affairs in order and get into shape so they can present for a job interview and maybe even look forward to engaging in some useful work. But we do know this: once people are on jobseeker, if it gets to 12 months or longer or if they are in an older demographic, it's extraordinarily difficult to move them off it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that, for lots of people who've been thrown on the scrap heap because of the pandemic—through no fault of this government; I accept that—you're going to have to have a new set of lenses on the solutions. With a properly skilled task force from Treasury looking at this, there is so much work that could be done to get people back to normality. It would tie 4,000 or 5,000 dnata workers to their employer, giving that company the capacity to bounce back, because if, as our Premier in South Australia says, we have no border conflict on 20 July, then I expect Adelaide Airport will go back to where it was, which is flights every hour or every half an hour. I would expect those cargo terminals to be booming and loading and I would expect those people who are currently starving because they have no income and are living off whatever savings they have and off support from family and friends to go back into the workforce. You've got to keep that workforce loyal and tied to the employer, and the social services minister and this chamber should allow the disallowance on that dnata decision. It should be done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should be looking at all the regional employment in universities. We should be looking very carefully at the economic impact on those regional communities. If you take 400 jobs out of any regional community, it will be catastrophic. You will set that town back decades. It will not bounce back. It won't snap back. In fact, it'll be crawling back for decades. If you have the wherewithal to do it, you should be targeting, very selectively, the greatest economic return and the greatest compassion. Let's be fairly clear about this: no-one in the workforce is at fault here. The pandemic has happened. The government has risen to the challenge, but it hasn't been selective, targeted and nimble enough to respond to all of the things that are pointed out by the various groups in this place. The opposition is not bereft of ideas, nor are the Australian Greens. When there is some articulated research policy position, it should be considered by the other side. Let's face it, if it's a good decision, claim the victory and do it. Just move on. Get people back onto JobKeeper when they've been unfairly rubbed out. Look at the university sector and ensure there's no detriment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Look at those people—and I know a few people who were on Newstart, which is now jobseeker—who lives have all of a sudden been transformed. Those people now have new-found confidence because the increase in the supplement they got has lifted them immensely. I fully expect lots of those people will go out and be able to get employment, because what it takes is a bit of pump priming. It doesn't take robodebt. It doesn't take cashless welfare cards. It's hope you give them. When you give them a couple of bucks over what they've had, they've got hope that they can resurrect things. I implore the other side to think carefully about all of this and put in place some of the genuine things that have been suggested.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SIEWERT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:30</span>):  I rise tonight to express my deep concern at the Prime Minister's hurtful and, I must say, ignorant comments yesterday when he claimed there was no slavery in Australia. Today he attempted to wind back those comments by denying our history and saying one of the principles of the First Fleet was to not have lawful slavery, and that was indeed the case. To the Prime Minister: there was slavery in Australia and it was sanctioned by law. We had a slave trade in this country. Generations of colonisers and Australians profited from the exploitation and abuse of First Nations peoples and Pacific islanders. There is no question that slavery is unfortunately a part of our nation's history. These attempts to whitewash and erase history are deeply traumatising for First Nations peoples and for the broader community as well, knowing and hearing this happened. I'd argue that many First Nations peoples still feel the effects today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Slavery emerged in Australia in the 19th century and the system didn't end until well into the 20th century. Legislation in the Northern Territory, Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland facilitated the enslavement of First Nations peoples. Just take the Aboriginal Ordinance 1918, which allowed the forced recruitment of First Nations workers in the Northern Territory and legislated the non-payment of wages. In Queensland, there was a licensed system that allowed for the recruitment of First Nations peoples without their consent. First Nations peoples were forced to work for tobacco and flour, but, let me be clear, working for rations is slavery. First Nations peoples in Australia were made to work on pearl farms and on pastoral stations for nothing. Members of the stolen generations were denied their wages, education and childhood while working as domestic servants or farmhands after they were forcibly removed from their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout the 19th century, around 62,500 Pacific islanders were transported to Australia and enslaved to work in the sugarcane fields of Queensland and New South Wales. The practice was known as blackbirding, a phrase which comes from the African slave trade. Pacific islanders were kidnapped, exploited and transferred as an asset when property was sold. In some cases entire male populations were kidnapped.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year the Queensland government settled a landmark federal class action. They agreed to pay $190 million in compensation to First Nations peoples who had their wages stolen by the government. The judge found that First Nations workers were, 'controlled by government-appointed superintendents or protectors in relation to their ability or capacity to earn income, own property, move or travel to areas outside the settlements, marry or even engage in customary native practices.' Not being paid for work or being told who you can marry is slavery. That's part of that court case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This ruling is just the tip of the iceberg. First Nations peoples are still fighting for justice and stolen wages, including in my home state of Western Australia. First Nations peoples had their land stolen, their labour stolen and their children stolen. This is the truth of our colonial history. The effects are still being felt today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge all members in this place to end the silence and the denial. It is time for truth-telling, listening and healing as we stand with First Nations peoples to address the unfinished business in this country, of which we have a lot. We will not successfully close the gap until we make sure that we do tell the truth and we do go through a healing process in this country. It is a key part of closing the gap. The Prime Minister denied it and then didn't really apologise, compounding the mistake of saying that slavery did not happen in this country. If he's going to try to apologise, he should do it properly and acknowledge that it did occur—because then he tried to say it didn't occur in New South Wales. Quite clearly it did. Acknowledge the truth.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Time"> (Queensland) (17:35</span>):  It was quite interesting to listen to Senator Siewert's comments in saying that they weren't paid the wages. It was an understanding there at the time that a lot of the Aboriginals went to the properties and were given food and shelter and looked after, and they were happy. When they brought in wages, those Aboriginals then moved on. They didn't have shelter. They had nothing done for them. They didn't know how to. So it's a two-way street here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not denying what has happened in the past, and it is a crying shame. That will never happen again. But to keep dragging it up and making Australians feel that they aren't welcome in this country, that we stole their country—what has happened in the past can never change. We are all Australians together to enjoy this beautiful country together, united, but I'm sick of the division that's happening, and that was quite evident last Saturday with the placards out there reading 'Black Lives Matter'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've raised on the floor of parliament this week that all lives matter, but that's of no interest to the other members on the floor of this chamber—other than one other senator: Senator Malcolm Roberts. That is a crying shame because you're letting a lot of Australians down by not supporting 'all lives matter'. What does it matter if you actually say that? What is the problem? Are you too scared to understand that you are appealing to these lefties like the Greens pushing their agenda—these elitists who are allowing the whole system of victimisation? Didn't Rudd say sorry? Hasn't there been compensation? How much longer has this got to go on?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to ask some questions here. Who's an Aboriginal? I'll tell you what: since 1971, at the first census, there were about 116,000. Now we've increased 459 per cent to 798,400. Why? I'll tell you why. The definition of 'Aboriginal' continues to be contentious and unclear in many cases. The Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies provides an outline of a three-step working criterion for confirming Aboriginality, and this is usually accepted by government agencies and community organisations. The three points are: being of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent, identifying as an Aboriginal or Torres Straight Islander person or being accepted as such by a community in which you live or formerly lived. So we're getting people out there, possibly as white as me, claiming to be Aboriginal. We're basing our laws and funding on the fact that you're claiming to be Aboriginal. That's why there has been the increase of 459 per cent. It's a bandwagon. It's an industry. That's what we've created.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're not looking at people on an individual needs basis. I've got people who are white who are sleeping in cars with their children. They can't get housing. They are disadvantaged. So jobs, health, education—everyone should be treated equally. But, because you ticked the box that says you're Aboriginal, you can have the benefits, like ABSTUDY. That's quite interesting: school term allowances of around $500 a year to pay for school supplies, away-from-base payments and reimbursement costs. ABSTUDY payments are also available to those serving jail sentences. You've got a fortnightly living allowance of $1,074 for those studying for their master's or doctorate. You've got the master's and doctorate relocation allowance of approximately $1,500, along with away-from-base travel allowance of up to $2,080 annually. These are all things in education. Then you go into legal services, home loans, health, royalties and mining. In the Northern Territory, the Aboriginal Benefit Account has $426 million.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today Malcolm Roberts put up a notice of motion that was based on facts. He notes the 2020 Australian Institute of Criminology report <span style="font-style:italic;">Deaths in custody</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> in Australia 2017-18 </span>but was denied leave in the parliament here to state the facts. It says that in 2017-18 total deaths in police custody and custody-related operations were three Indigenous persons and 14 non-Indigenous persons. So the facts that they're out there advocating aren't the truth, but you won't allow the truth to be told here, because it doesn't suit your agenda. There are a lot more things that I wanted to say, but I will continue to raise this— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282997" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SCARR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:40</span>):  Yesterday I was truly honoured to move a motion expressing the Senate's deep appreciation to members of the Brisbane Sikh Gurdwara for their efforts in helping people in need during the coronavirus pandemic. The motion was co-sponsored by my fellow LNP senators from Queensland and was passed. It is important, extremely important, that this place acknowledges and appreciates the efforts of the Brisbane Sikh Gurdwara and that that appreciation is now on the parliamentary record, because it should be. It should be because it represents the best of Australia's values—Australians reaching out to people in need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also place on the record my appreciation for the efforts of the members of all of the other Sikh gurdwaras across our beautiful country, helping people at this time, and that includes the Singh Sabha Temple Brisbane at Taigum; Gold Coast Gurdwara, Sikh Temple and Community Education Centre at Helensvale; and also the Gurdwara Sahib Gold Coast at Nerang—and all the other gurdwaras in all the other states across our beautiful country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to thank Parnam Singh for organising my visit to the Brisbane Sikh Gurdwara, and I'd also like to place my thanks on the record and my appreciation of Nash Dosanjh for organising for me to assist in the drop-off of meals and grocery hampers with members of the gurdwara. I deeply appreciate their assistance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Brisbane Sikh Gurdwara has provided approximately 20,000 free cooked meals and 2,000 free grocery hampers to people in need during the coronavirus pandemic. In providing that assistance, members of the Brisbane Sikh Gurdwara have volunteered their time continually over the last three months. I met some of these volunteers. Some of these volunteers have worked every single day for over two months between the hours of 6.30 am and 8.30 pm on this project—14 hours a day on this project—to deliver those 20,000 free cooked meals and 2,000 free grocery hampers. Fourteen hours a day is quite extraordinary, and it's appropriate that I put their names on this parliamentary record so their selfless service can be recognised by their fellow Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tejpal Singh has been intimately involved in organising food and groceries, packing and delivery. Gurpreet Singh Bal has been packing food and has been in charge of the kitchen—and what a well-run kitchen it is. It's certainly better run than my kitchen upstairs at the moment! Surinder Singh has been grocery packing. Rocky Singh has been packing food and cooking. Kishore Kumar has been handing over cooked food to people attending the gurdwara to pick up food and grocery hampers. Manmohan Singh Bhullar has been delivering food and groceries. Gurpreet Singh: cooking food—and what beautiful food it is. Manmohan mentioned to me when I was visiting the temple that one of the reasons this food tastes so good is because of the TLC, the tender loving care, that's put into the food. And he's right; he's absolutely correct. Gurpreet Singh: cooking food—as I said, beautiful food. Harpreet Singh: handing out food to people attending to picking up food and grocery hampers. Sonu has been helping in the kitchen, cleaning these huge industrial sized cooking pots and, as I mentioned, Nash Dosanjh has been delivering food and groceries. Nash also provided me with an opportunity to participate in the delivery of some of these free cooked meals and grocery hampers, and it was an absolute joy spending time with members of the Brisbane Sikh temple on their bus travelling around Brisbane delivering this free food and these grocery hampers. There was such an atmosphere of kindness and goodness and good humour on that bus. It was just an absolutely terrific experience. The first person in need we visited was Alejandro from Colombia, an international student. I really pay homage to all of our multicultural communities who are out there assisting international students at this point in time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to make three reflections on what I saw. The first is on the dignity and respect with which members of the gurdwara treated every person they assisted. It can be hard for people to reach out for help. They might be embarrassed. They might be self-conscious. They might find it quite difficult to seek that assistance. But the members of the gurdwara treated them with absolute respect. Secondly, I note that the assistance has been provided to Australians and visitors to Australia irrespective of race, religion or nationality. That is a reflection of the Sikh religion, a belief that we as humans are all equal and part of the oneness of humanity. Third was the importance for assistance to be given in a selfless way, not looking for anything in return, just wanting to help someone, just wanting to give. I must say that, in my time visiting the temple the first time and then participating in the deliveries, not once did any of those volunteers or members of that community raise any personal hardship with me. There were no complaints. Their sole focus was on helping others. It was absolutely inspirational. They also told me, in terms of the importance of giving, that each donation has the same moral significance. It doesn't matter if it's $1 or $1,000; it has the same moral significance. That's such a powerful message.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not the first time that this gurdwara—and I'm sure for gurdwaras all over this country—has provided assistance to people in need. I was told that the Brisbane Sikh gurdwara previously helped members of the Australian community at the time of the most recent bushfires and droughts and has delivered water and other essential services. Of course, as at many gurdwaras, the Brisbane Sikh gurdwara has a langar, a community kitchen providing free meals, prepared by volunteers, to all the visitors of the gurdwara, without distinction related to religion, gender, economic status or ethnicity. They all sit on the floor together, representing their common humanity and their equality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk about the Australian character, when we talk about what it means to be Australian, it is defined by the actions of each and every one of us. And the efforts of the members of the Brisbane Sikh gurdwara represent the very best of Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="122087" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McCARTHY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:48</span>):  I rise tonight to commend the support of senators in terms of the very difficult challenges that our country faces right now. We as a nation have obviously had to deal with an incredible pandemic, and we continue to deal with that. But even more importantly and most recently we are looking at Black Lives Matter and the rallies that have occurred across the country, where close to 100,000 Australians have taken their passion, their purpose and their beliefs to the streets. I've heard many debates and comments not just in the Senate but externally as well, and I come back to what it is that we must all find. Here in this Senate this week I believe we found a common goal. We supported a motion brought before the Senate about Black Lives Matter. I want to explain to the Australian people, and to anyone else who is listening, that when we say, 'Black lives matter,' it's not about saying that no-one else matters. It's not about saying that no-one else's life matters. When the Senate supported the motion of the rallies, of the passion, of the calls to reduce the high incarceration rates of First Nations people, to stop the high rates of removal of First Nations children from their families, to stop the deaths in custody across our country, it was saying: 'We know that that is a great weakness in our country. We know that that is a great weakness in our system of governance not just federally but in the states and territories.' No government, no political party, is immune from the fact that there is systemic failure, that a population of people who are not even quite three per cent in this country of over 18 million people can experience such severe suffering. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People have asked, 'Why are you protesting now? This is not a good time.' But just let me remind the Senate and all Australians that when any change has taken place in the history of not only this country but the history of countries around the world it is never at a convenient time. It is never diarised. It is never planned. People are not asked if they want change, when there is a deeper movement of spirits, of heart, a collective call, a cry even, to be heard. That's what's happening in our country. That's what is happening in the hearts and minds of so many Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's interesting when I reflect on my colleague Senator Pat Dodson. When he spoke to our caucus and tried to explain as best he could the complexities and the difficulties that our country is facing, he searched for a common theme. When the Black Lives Matter protesters walk the streets of Australia, they refer to the death of an American man who said, 'I can't breathe. I can't breathe.' And Senator Dodson took those words and said, 'And here we are in a pandemic, and what do people who suffer from COVID-19 say? I can't breathe. I can't breathe.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So none of this, I believe, is a coincidence. None of this was planned. We didn't come in on 31 January 2019 to witness 1 January 2020 and see any of this happening; none of us did. We didn't see the bushfires coming. We didn't see the hailstorm that hit Canberra. We saw COVID in the distance, but we thought we were okay. And we didn't see George Floyd being such an integral person in the lives of millions of people around the world who touched something in so many that they were prepared to defy a pandemic that said, 'I can't breathe.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The challenge for this Senate, for the other House, for our Prime Minister and our leadership is not to create further division and not to be afraid to say, 'It's so hard that we can't answer these questions.' And it's to find the solution that is not so unfair—the quick fix that says: 'Let's demonise the mob; let's demonise the ones we don't know how to talk to. Let's demonise the ones that we don't understand.' That's the challenge of leaders: that's the challenge for leaders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We stand in the Senate and we stand in the House of Representatives; we stand to represent the people because we don't understand. There are so many things I don't understand, but just because I don't understand them doesn't mean that I close the door to them. It doesn't mean that I say: 'Oh, well, that person is yuck—forget that! I'm not going to talk to them!' The challenge for leaders and the challenge for the Prime Minister, this Senate and the House of Representatives is to find a path that unites all Australians—all of us. We so desperately need that kind of leadership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Don't demonise the people who feel so passionately for First Nations people and the high incarceration rates in this country. Don't demonise the people who feel so passionately for the fact that First Nations children are removed at such a dramatic rate in this country. Do not demonise Australian people because they feel so passionately about following their democratic rights to be heard. Do not demonise them; listen to them. Believe in them, as they believe in a cause that moves and shapes them in a way that is profoundly important for our country if we are to walk together as all Australians in peace and with the sense that, though we may never understand each other properly, we must focus on the fact that we can do it together, in unity and with respect for our differences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, Prime Minister, don't divide our country. Don't demonise the Australian people who believe or think differently to you. Find a better way. Find a way that unites all of us as the people of Australia.</span>
