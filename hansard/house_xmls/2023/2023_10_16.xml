            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to cease preparations to hold a referendum on "A Proposed Law: to alter the Constitution to recognise the First Peoples of Australia by establishing an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice", aka "The Voice", be ceased immediately. I call for this not in the cause of discrimination, racism, divisiveness, or any other reason apart from, the fact, that it is unnecessary and an unprecedented waste of taxpayer's money. A "Voice" can be created without a change to the constitution. Referendums are only required when the constitution does not permit the passage of a law, "The Voice" can be created without an expensive change in The Constitution and is unnecessary. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">This should happen as a matter of urgency so that an alternate referendum that recognises Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in The Constitution can be conceived and implemented within an achievable time frame. I believe that the majority of Australians support the recognition of the recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander in the constitution and it would be an utter travesty if this were not to occur due to a misguided, unnecessary, expensive, construction. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has done incredibly well on reducing the utilization of cash over the number of years, however its going wrong on allowing businesses to pass electronic transaction costs in the form of Surcharge back to consumers. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Each transaction is becoming costlier by 1.5%-2.00% on average, demotivating consumers to pay by e-POS. In fact, I've come across business offering customers 5% discount on the bill for paying by cash. Cash is a cost to the taxpayer. Cash is a way of avoiding declaring full revenue and reducing tax. Cash creates physical security risks for both users and receivers. In Europe Surcharging is completely banned for these and many other reasons. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">E-pos is just part of the cost of doing business, the RBA should not regulate these costs be passed on to consumers. By that virtue, there is on average a 2% cost associated to print, transport and manage notes, why not pass that cost on to cash users too?</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to request the RBA to ban/disallow surcharging on non-cash transactions of all types. Consumers should not be passed on the cost of businesses deciding to accept electronic payments. It should be a commercial decision that each business should take based on what they deem is best for them rather than pushing the society into using cash, and penalizing them for not using it.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Currently flea, tick and heartworm products are available for purchase without a prescription. This can be dangerous for some pets as their health status needs to be assessed by a veterinarian before using these products. For example, flea and tick products containing isoxazolines should be used with caution on sick, debilitated or underweight animals and animals with a history of seizures. Also animals should be tested for adult heartworm infection before being giving heartworm preventatives as they don't actually kill adult heartworms. If already infected animals can spread the disease even when they are on heartworm preventatives. </span>

Additionally, we ask the House to direct the APVMA to put the following warnings on the front of the packaging of these products—Use with caution on sick, debilitated or underweight animals, Use with caution on animals with a history of seizures and Test for adult heartworm infection before using this product. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The surge in violence in Manipur, along with distressing reports of persecution against Christians and other minorities in India, highlights a critical concern for basic human rights. The escalating violence against Kuki-Christians in Manipur, India is deeply alarming, displaying distressing signs of genocide. The tragedy of innocent lives lost, property destruction, fear, and instability extend beyond the Kuki-christians, encompassing all minorities subjected to massacre and abuse under the present Indian government. These reports indicate potential breaches of United Nations human-rights, unfolding under the Hindutva agenda of the present Indian government.</span>

Australia, rooted in democratic egalitarianism and devoted to human-rights, must denounce violence against Kuki-Christians. Religious freedom, devoid of fear is enshrined in international human rights agreements. As a nation that values diversity, democracy, and religious freedom, Australia has a responsibility to speak out against such violations.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">EDRs are not currently regulated in Australia. Australia is lagging other countries in its capability to collect accurate crash related data. EDRs have been regulated in the USA since 2006 and in Europe since 2022. EDRs are also mandated numerous other countries including China and Japan. Practitioners have urged the Australian Government to adopt a similar EDR-related regulation in line with the current National Road Safety Strategy 2021-2030. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The primary benefit of EDRs is their provision of immediate, accurate data. Rapid access to crash data saves time, money, and facilitates policy making. Research has shown that fleet vehicles equipped with EDRs resulted in a 20% reduction in crashes. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Russia is a security threat to Australia. Its Consulate in Sydney serves no practical purpose that benefits the Australian-Russian relationship. Passports and other consular activities can be undertaken via the Russian embassy in Canberra with no loss of activities. Further, international sanctions mean that no trade activities will be conducted from the Sydney consulate. Notably, a recent poll shows 93% of Australians see Russia's foreign policy as a threat (Lowy Institute, 2023). And in the West, more than 600 Russian diplomats accused of spying were already expelled. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Consulate's activities allegedly include coordinating espionage activities, gathering place for ultra-nationalists and harbouring Simeon Boikov, an Australian national with an arrest warrant. Mr Boikov has utilised the Consulate for cyber and physical attacks on Australian people and organisations; runs live streams that promote anti-Australian Russian propaganda; he calls to deploy nuclear weapons retaliation and sends money to Africa to finance destabilisation in the region. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Furthermore, Russia continues to breach international law and perpetrate war crimes against Ukrainians, with the UN reporting that women have been gang-raped, men castrated, children sexually abused (18/10/22) and stating that Russia performs deliberate state-endorsed torture (15/6/23). </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to seek the closure of the Russian Consulate in Sydney and the expulsion of its staff from Australia to reduce the threat of espionage, reflect the national interest and show Government's strong opposition to the war. The Consulate staff, especially Simeon Boikov, have breached their diplomatic duties and no longer warrant immunity. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">This is perhaps one of the leading causes of regular family run cleaning businesses going under. Competing companies are forcing workers to work under their own ABN where they often avoid paying Super, Insurance, award rates, penalties and more. The practice of forcing businesses into the building industry classification for insurance may be a major reason for businesses doing the wrong thing. It is very veasible to think that there would be much less worker abuse in the country if things were different. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Below is the insurance cost for a business in $ per $100 of wages for many industries.

              <span class="HPS-Small">Lately there has been increased media coverage of new Covid variants and rising case numbers. "Experts" have been advising people to wear masks and get booster shots. It seems as though we are being primed for the reintroduction of Covid restrictions. My experience from 2020 taught me that one must be pre-emptive rather than reactive. While many of the Covid measures were implemented at the state level, the Federal Government exerted a great deal of influence over the states' responses to Covid. They subsidised lockdowns through schemes such as JobKeeper. They purchased vaccines and made the registration of Covid vaccinations mandatory, which enabled the states to impose vax passes. They engaged in censorship on social media, quashing the voices of those who spoke out against the measures the states were taking. They imposed hotel quarantine and built quarantine camps. They prevented people from entering and leaving the country. They provided ADF personnel to enforce state lockdowns. They discussed policy with state leaders in National Cabinet meetings. And so on. The states could not have imposed such harsh lockdowns for so long without support from the Federal Government. There were also Federal mask and vaccination requirements. Any return to lockdowns, mask mandates, vaccine mandates, curfews, border closures, travel bans, hotel quarantine, quarantine camps, social distancing, etc., would be totally unacceptable. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to oppose the introduction of any new Federal Covid restrictions and oppose the facilitation, coordination or subsidisation of any new state restrictions.</span>

Consumers, especially those who purchase high value goods such as motor vehicles (MVs) and recreational vehicles (RVs), are consistently being caused serious financial, physical, emotional and mental health harm, simply because they purchase 'lemon' defective products from a supplier who refuses to comply with the Australian Consumer Law (ACL). </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Both industries regularly force consumers to engage in expensive and protracted litigation where the defects in the goods are obviously manufacturing defects. The losses can be in the tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Many are vulnerable consumers and have their lives and retirements destroyed. The ACCC has known about the problems with multiple suppliers in both industries and do little to nothing to prevent this conduct, where they do have actions available to them in the ACL but choose not to use them. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Climate change is an urgent global crisis that demands immediate action. Empowering individual consumers to make informed choices is crucial. Australians lack accessible information regarding the carbon footprint of the products they purchase. This limitation inhibits their ability to make environmentally responsible choices and places the onus solely on producers to act sustainably.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Furthermore, by making the carbon footprint of imported products visible, consumers may be more inclined to choose goods made locally, many of which will likely be made with reduced transportation emissions. This would act as an incentive for consumers to support local manufacturers and producers. This could rejuvenate local economies, create jobs, and set a precedence for sustainable business practices within Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to Representatives to enact legislation requiring that all retail goods imported into Australia from 2027 onwards be labelled with their CO2 equivalent emissions. Such labelling should be standardized, easily visible, and should include the total emissions generated from raw material extraction to manufacturing, shipping, and disposal. This initiative will bring about greater transparency, empowering consumers to make more informed decisions and driving companies towards sustainability. It is a small but essential step that allows everyone to participate in mitigating the devastating impacts of climate change actively.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">In Australia women have the option to opt out of motherhood however men cannot opt out of fatherhood. We ask that equality is insured to all Australian citizens. We need to ensure that all citizens are treated fairly and equally without bias towards gender. We recognise there could a myriad of reasons as to why a woman would seek an abortion. We believe it is only fair to extend those same rights to Australian men. A financial or legal abortion would ensure that no Australian man is forced into fatherhood and could opt out. Just as we must respect a woman's bodily autonomy forcing men into unwanted fatherhood forces them into transactional relationships they do not want.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">We, as citizens of Australia, rise united against an alarming and escalating crisis that imperils the very fabric of our society. The pervasive scourge of explicit po*nography and sexual content is not only tearing at our moral foundations but also fostering a breeding ground for heinous crimes that threaten our safety, dignity, and future. These materials have a detrimental impact on individuals, families, relationships, and societal values. They contribute to the objectification of individuals, perpetuate harmful stereotypes, and can lead to harmful behaviours and attitudes and crimes. Children and young people are particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of exposure to explicit content, as it can shape their perceptions of healthy relationships and sexual behaviours. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">This crisis transcends mere content; it is a crisis of values, relationships, and human dignity. Explicit material infiltrates our homes, schools, and workplaces, systematically warping our perception of consent, respect, and love. It sows seeds of objectification that sprout into attitudes of entitlement and disrespect.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The dangers stretch beyond distorted beliefs. We must confront the alarming rise in crimes that are fuelled by explicit content—crimes such as harassment, cyberbullying, and even human and sex trafficking. These insidious activities thrive in the shadows of a society that tolerates the degradation of human beings.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

Siemens Gamesa ended the year with a quarterly loss of E 884 million ($ AUD 1.4 billion), more than double the prior year, and net debt of E 1.9 billion. Spain's latest manufacturer. Vestas has added E 210 million in warranty provisions for repairs in the December quarter a Danish company.( source Rachel Williamson Renew Economy article 9 February 2023.) The hype about offshore wind energy keeps getting scuttled by reality. That's the clear conclusion from last month's announcement that Spanish utility company Avangrid was halting work on the proposed 1,200 megawatt Commonwealth Wind project because it was "no longer viable" ( Forbes Robert Bryce 18 November 2022 ) North Atlantic ocean. See "Thrown to the wind" a documentary about how offshore wind turbines are killing Right whales with 1,000 of wind turbines making noise pollution ! How can Federal Energy Minister Mr Chris Bowen allows these off shore wind turbines developments to happen in the Illawarra and Greater Newcasltle regions when in possession of this knowledge from emails and messages sent to him? These projects planned are neither renewable or sustainable if sanctioned to proceed? Would the Minister be derelict in his duties to taxpayers and the public purse if he did not immediately cancel these developments?</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Legalizing the death penalty for convicted pedophiles serves as a powerful deterrent and sends a clear message that we will not tolerate such abhorrent behavior. It would act as a deterrent for potential offenders, knowing that their actions could cost them their lives. The fear of capital punishment could potentially prevent countless innocent children from becoming victims.</span>

It provides a sense of closure and justice, knowing that the perpetrator will face the ultimate consequences for their actions. It is a way for society to demonstrate its commitment to protecting children and to standing up against those who seek to harm them.</span>

It may involve working with citizens and help the people and animals in need during the full calendar year. By including days spent in charities as part of the 88 days requirement, more individuals will be encouraged to participate in the life of the community, which will ultimately benefit the sector and address volunteers shortages.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence dated 7 November 2022 to the Minister for Social Services, the Hon Amanda Rishworth MP, concerning petition reference EN4105. As the matter raised falls within my portfolio responsibilities, your email has been forwarded to me for reply.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Government understands access to safe and affordable housing is central to the security and dignity of all Australians. The Government is committed to an ambitious housing agenda which will boost the supply of all housing to address the cost of housing whether you are buying or renting.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The National Rental Affordability Scheme (NRAS, the Scheme) is an Australian Government affordable housing initiative, delivered in partnership with state and territory governments which was terminated by the former Federal Liberal Government in 2014. There are dwellings remaining in the Scheme which will continue to offer reduced rents until 2026. It was announced in the 2014-15 Budget, there will be no further funding rounds or new allocations of NRAS incentives beyond those currently allocated in the Scheme and held by approved participants.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At the conclusion of the Scheme, NRAS dwellings will remain subject to all relevant state and territory government tenancy laws, with respect to lease agreements and rental increases. Some NRAS allocations are held by endorsed charities, which includes Community Housing Providers (CHPs). Some CHPs may continue to offer reduced rents.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In regards to the request of the petition in relation to tenancy rights, while the regulation of residential tenancies, agreements and rental pricing, is a matter for state and territory governments, the Albanese Labor Government continues to work with all tiers of government to deliver better housing outcomes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At National Cabinet in August this year the Commonwealth, state and territory governments committed to <span style="font-weight:bold;">A Better Deal for Renters </span>to harmonise and strengthen renters' rights across Australia. This included developing a nationally consistent framework including a requirement for genuine reasonable grounds for eviction, moving towards limiting rental increases to once a year and phasing in minimum rental standards.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These changes will make a tangible impact for the almost one-third of Australian households who rent.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Government has committed to an ambitious housing reform agenda which will boost the supply of all housing—more public and social housing, more affordable housing, more homes to rent and more homes to buy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These housing challenges didn't happen overnight and cannot be solved by one government alone. As mentioned, the Albanese Government is working with the states and territories and local governments to deliver better housing outcomes.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This includes the work being delivered through National Cabinet to provide more secure and affordable housing supply. Significant measures include:</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund to support 30,000 new social and affordable rental homes over its first five years has, for the second time, been introduced into the Parliament. We've reintroduced this important legislation because we want to use every process available to ensure tens of thousands of new homes are built for Australians.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">We've also established an interim National Housing Supply and Affordability Council to provide expert advice and an evidence base on how Government can improve housing supply and affordability, while legislation goes through the Parliament to create the Council as an independent body.</span>

I appreciate you raising your concerns on this matter and understand there was a technical issue which delayed it being forwarded to me.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has repeatedly condemned Russia's unprovoked and illegal invasion of Ukraine, and continues to call for its withdrawal from Ukrainian territory. The Government is providing military assistance to Ukraine to support its defence.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 7 November 2022, received by my Office on 25 July 2023, concerning Petition Ministerial Referral EN4130, on financial independence, suspension from Centrelink, and homelessness services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's social security system is a non-contributory system designed to support the basic living standards of all Australians. It is a means-tested, residence-based system, designed to provide income support to people who, for reasons such as age, unemployment or ill health, are unable to support themselves.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A range of social security payments are available for people who are looking for work or temporarily unable to work. For example, JobSeeker Payment is an income support payment that provides financial assistance to people aged 22 years to age-pension age, who have capacity to work now or in the near future.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Eligibility for JobSeeker Payment requires that a person is unemployed for the purposes of JobSeeker Payment, has income and assets below relevant thresholds and, unless temporarily exempted, meets mutual obligation requirements. These requirements include actively looking for a job, and undertaking activities to improve their work prospects, such as further study, training, approved voluntary work or Work for the Dole.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under current arrangements, job seekers may be subject to demerits or payment suspensions if they do not meet mutual obligation requirements, without a valid reason. Job seekers may qualify for an exemption from their mutual obligation requirements when their personal circumstances make it difficult for them to meet those requirements. A person may qualify for an exemption for a range of reasons including, but not limited to, having a medical condition, experiencing homelessness or experiencing family and domestic violence.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 25 July 2023 regarding Petition EN4168, which called for the legalisation of the recreational use and cultivation of cannabis for adults in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government does not propose to legalise the production, sale and use of cannabis for recreational purposes. Legislation relating to the legalisation or decriminalisation of illicit drugs, including cannabis, are largely matters for state and tenitory governments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to preventing and minimising the harms associated with the use of illicit drugs on individuals, families and communities across Australia. The approach is set out in the National <span style="font-style:italic;">Drug Strategy 2017-2026. </span>The Strategy outlines a balanced approach between health and law enforcement, and provides a national commitment to harm minimisation through evidence-based demand, supply and ha1m reduction initiatives.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The use of cannabis for recreational purposes has been linked to a number of short and long-term adverse effects. Twenty per cent of Australia's drug and alcohol treatment services are being provided to people identifying cannabis as their principal drug of concern. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is often at high levels in illicit cannabis products, can exacerbate mental health conditions as well as other health conditions. Further information on cannabis harms can be accessed at: https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/marijuana.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While recreational use of cannabis remains illegal, the Government supp01is the needs of patients to access a safe, legal and reliable supply of medicinal cannabis products for the management of painful and chronic conditions. Information on Australia's medicinal cannabis licensing scheme can be found at: https://www.tga.gov.au/accessing-medicinal-cannabis-patient.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 7 November 2022 regarding petition EN4201 to pass legislation banning the outing of LGBTQIA+ youth. Unfortunately, due to a technical error, your correspondence was not received by my office until 26 July 2023. I regret the delay in responding.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Sex Discrimination Act 1984 </span>(Cth) prohibits discrimination on these grounds in a range of areas of public life, including employment, education and in the provision of goods, services and facilities. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Fair Work Act 2009 </span>also contains an anti-discrimination framework applicable to most Australian workplaces. This framework prohibits workplace discrimination that is based on sexual orientation, gender identity or intersex status (among other protected attributes).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Within schools, the Government has implemented a range of programs to support LGBTQIA+ youth. The Foundation to Year 10 (F-10) Australian Curriculum includes the general capabilities of Personal and Social Capability and Ethical Understanding, which encourage students to engage respectfully with LGBTQIA+ issues. The Student Wellbeing Hub, which provides free information and resources for educators, students and parents, includes specific resources designed to support LGBTQIA+ students and their families, and to assist educators to promote an inclusive classroom environment. The Hub can be accessed at www.studentwellbeinghub.edu.au.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the Australian Government plays a national leadership role in school education, state and territory governments and non-government education authorities and individual schools are responsible for the day-to-day delivery of education and management of schools, including the development of policies relating to student information.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) is currently conducting a review of religious exemptions for educational institutions in Government anti-discrimination law. The Government views the ALRC review as a first step towards implementing the Government's commitment to extending anti-discrimination protections to more Australians, including to students and staff in religious schools. The review's formal submission process closed on 24 February 2023. Stakeholder feedback received during this process is being thoroughly considered by the ALRC and will be used to inform its final advice, to be provided to the Government by 31 December 2023.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In recognition of their important role, the Government moved the ABC and the SBS to 5-year funding terms commencing 1 July 2023 as part of the 2023-24 Budget. These new arrangements extend previous multi-year funding arrangements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Over the 5-year term to 30 June 2028, the ABC will receive $6.0 billion, and the SBS will receive $1.8 billion. The transition to 5-year funding terms will provide the national broadcasters with more funding stability, allowing them to plan with more confidence. The ABC also received $32.0 million over 4 years from 2022-23 to expand transmission, content production, and capacity-building in the Inda-Pacific region.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 7 November 2022 on behalf of 20 signatories regarding Petition EN4274—<span style="font-style:italic;">Have online poker unbanned in Australia. </span>I note that due to a technical error, your email was received in my office on 26 July 2023. I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises the ongoing community concerns about the harms associated with online gambling. The Government is committed to guaranteeing online gambling takes place under a robust legislative framework with strong consumer protections. The current priority of the Government for online gambling is harm minimisation and to deliver consumer protection measures that are aligned with community expectations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 15 September 2022, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs launched an inquiry into online gambling and its impacts on those experiencing gambling harm. The Committee examined a range of issues, including the effectiveness of current gambling advertising restrictions, and regulatory and licensing regimes around online gambling.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee handed down its final report on 28 June 2023 and the Government is now considering the Committee's 31 recommendations. Information about the inquiry and its final report can be found at:    <br clear="all">.</br>www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/House/Social_Policy_and_Legal Affairs/Onlinegamblingimpacts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Separately, the Government is progressing a number of important consumer protections to reduce online gambling harms, including:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">National Self-Exclusion Register (BetStop): On 21 August 2023, the Government launched BetStop—the National Self-Exclusion Register, which allows individuals experiencing gambling harms to exclude themselves from Australian licensed online wagering services for three months, up to a lifetime. The Government will shortly introduce mandatory customer pre-verification requirements to open a betting account. Pre-verification will ensure protection for underage or self-excluded customers from accessing online gambling services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Banning credit betting: on 28 April 2023, the Hon Amanda Rishworth MP, the Minister for Social Services and I, announced the Government will legislate a ban on the use of credit cards for online wagering. The Government expects to introduce legislation by the end of 2023.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet"> Consistent gambling messaging: new evidence-based gambling taglines were introduced on 30 March 2023 to replace 'gamble responsibly' and must accompany all gambling advertisements that appear online, as well as on TV and radio.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet"> Classification: on 29 March 2023, the Government announced proposed improvements to the National Classification Scheme to address concerns about gambling-like content in video games. This includes a proposed mandatory minimum classification of R18+ for games that contain simulated gambling and M for games that contain paid loot boxes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Continued progress towards strengthening Australia's legislative framework and ensuring harm reduction measures are in place is essential before there is any consideration of legalising a new gambling service in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for taking the time to write to me on this matter. I trust this information is of assistance.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 25 July 2023 regarding petition EN4332 on the legitimacy of the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) system.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">When a student applies for enrolment in a Commonwealth supported place (CSP) or to access the Higher Education Loan Program (HELP), they are required to submit an electronic Commonwealth Assistance Form (eCAF) with their higher education provider.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The eCAF includes a declaration that the student has read and understood the associated HELP booklet, published by the Government. This measure seeks to ensure that prospective students are aware of their obligations before accessing the loan. Each booklet contains information on the income-contingent nature of the loan as well as indexation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The HELP booklets are published annually on the Study Assist website and are linked directly from the eCAF. They are also available at www.studyassist.gov.au/need-more-information/help-publications. Additionally, there are several videos published on the Study Assist website that explain the HELP scheme and how HELP debt repayments work.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The HELP scheme, and the previous HECS, is designed to reduce upfront barriers to education. This lifechanging support has made it possible for millions of Australians to get a university degree and the skills they need for the jobs being created in the future.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A university degree is a valuable investment that has the potential to help a person increase their earning capacity. Today, the average annual income of an individual with a university degree is approximately $30,000 more than the average annual income of someone whose last year of education was Year 12.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I appreciate there may be concerns about cost-of-living pressures and the impact of the rise in student debts due to this year's indexation figure. Indexation plays an important role in ensuring that debts maintain their real value over time and reinforces the long-term financial sustainability of HELP.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The application of indexation is legislated under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Higher Education Support Act 2003. </span>The income-contingent nature of HELP ensures that an individual only repays their HELP debt when they earn over the minimum repayment threshold—$51,550 in 2023-24.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">An individual who earns below the minimum repayment threshold is not required to make any repayments, and the Australian Government accepts that some people may never be able to do so.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has taken steps to address the impact of cost-of-living pressures in the recent Budget. The $14.6 billion cost-of-living package includes increasing the rate of JobSeeker, Youth allowance, Austudy, ABSTUDY and rental assistance which will help students pay for things like food and rent. More information is available https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/sites/default/files/2023-05/budget-2023-24-may-services-australia-2.pdf.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It may also interest students to know that the Government is committed to delivering an Australian Universities Accord (the Accord), a 12-month review of Australia's higher education system which is considering a range of issues including the importance of affordability and access for students.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Accord Interim Report was released on 19 July 2023, and proposed priority actions for Government to consider. The Government will act on the five immediate actions identified in the report ahead of the Accord Panel's Final Report. Submissions to the interim report are now open.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Accord Panel will provide a final report to the Government in December 2023, containing a series of recommendations and targets. Further information about the Accord and a copy of the Interim Report can be found on the Department of Education's website at www.education.gov.au/australian-universities-accord.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 25 July 2023 regarding petition EN4392 you presented in the House of Representatives on the establishment of a National Motorsport Strategy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Motorsport Australia is recognised by the Australian Sports Commission (ASC) as a National Sporting Organisation (NSO) covering a range of motorsport disciplines. As an NSO, Motorsport Australia is considered the pre-eminent body for motorsports in Australia and is responsible for developing any new strategies as relevant to their sport.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government, through the ASC, continues to develop sector wide strategies that provide guidance and support to all recognised sports. This includes the development of the National Sport Plan, Australia's 2032+ High Performance Sports Strategy, and the current development of a sector co-designed National Sport Participation Strategy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the 2023-24 financial year, Motorsport Australia received $200,000 from the Government, through the ASC, to support participation growth. Motorsport Australia are planning to use a portion of this funding to further build on their successful Girls on Track Program which will now include Inspire, Pathways, and Experience programs. Their Women's Introduction to Motorsport pilot program was successfully held in 2022-2023 and they are currently planning to hold more events in 2023-2024.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In May 2023, Motorsport Australia released their latest strategic plan for the period of 2023-2025. The ASC's participation growth funding will support one of the key initiatives in their plan to 'Expand and increase participation and engagement in motorsport'.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 7 November 2022, received by my office on 25 July 2023, concerning Petition EN4403 which seeks increased support for carers of the elderly.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government acknowledges the important contribution carers make to the lives of those they care for and supports their efforts and dedication. This is demonstrated through the range of payments, programs and services provided by the Government to support carers in their caring role.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Carer Payment provides income support to carers of people with disability, a medical condition and those who are frail from age. As a pension payment, it is paid at the highest legislated rate in the social security system, currently $1,064 per fortnight for singles or $802 for each member of a couple. Pension payments are indexed in March and September each year, to ensure payments keep pace with the cost of living, with next increase on 20 September 2023.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Qualification for Carer Payment includes a Pensioner Concession Card, which entitles carers to subsidised prescription medicines and some state-based concessions, such as discounts on motor vehicle registration, electricity, gas and rates. Carers who rent in the private rental market may also receive assistance though Commonwealth Rent Assistance, with maximum rates increasing by 15 per cent (plus indexation) on 20 September.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Most Carer Payment carers also receive Carer Allowance, a $144.80 fortnightly supplement to assist towards the costs a carer may incur, plus the annual $600 Carer Supplement. Carer Allowance is also available to other individuals who provide qualifying care.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Carer Gateway is also there to provide support and information to assist carers to access individually tailored services within their local area. Services include support planning, targeted financial support packages, counselling, peer support, information and advice, and where necessary, access to emergency respite. To discuss supports suitable for their situation, carers can contact Carer Gateway by calling 1800 422 737 or online at www.carergateway.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There are other government funded programs that support older Australians to maintain their independence and remain living at home within their communities. These supports can also benefit carers by reducing some of the care the carer provides.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth Home Support Programme assists frail, older people aged 65 years and over (or 50 years and over for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people) who need help with daily tasks due to their functional limitations. For older people with complex support needs, the Home Care Package can provide a coordinated package of services tailored to meet an individual's assessed care needs. Access is to these programs is through My Aged Care, who can be contacted on 1800 200 422 or via the website at www.myagedcare.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Support to navigate aged care services is available through the National Aged Care Advocacy Program (NACAP), delivered nationally through the Older Person's Advocacy Network. The NACAP helps older people and their carers to understand and exercise their aged care rights, seek aged care services that suit their needs and find solutions to issues they may be experiencing. NACAP can be contacted on 1800 700 600 or via their website at www.opan.com.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A number of measures in the 2023-24 Budget to support Australians with cost of living pressures may also benefit carers. This includes help with power bills (including for concession-card holders) through the Energy Bill Relief Fund, historic investments in Medicare to incentivise bulk-billing and cheaper medicines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for raising this matter with me, and I trust the information provided will be of assistance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 25 July 2023 regarding petition EN4411, which called for the legalisation of cannabis for personal use and the creation of a regulatory system for sale, consumption in public, trade of cannabis, and growing privately and commercially.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government does not propose to legalise the production, sale and use of cannabis for recreational purposes. Legislation relating to the legalisation or decriminalisation of illicit drugs, including cannabis, are largely matters for state and territory governments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to preventing and minimising the harms associated with the use of illicit drugs on individuals, families and communities across Australia. The approach is set out in the National <span style="font-style:italic;">Drug Strategy 2017-2026. </span>The Strategy outlines a balanced approach between health and law enforcement, and provides a national commitment to harm minimisation through evidence-based demand, supply and harm reduction initiatives.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The use of cannabis for recreational purposes has been linked to a number of sh01i and long-te1m adverse effects. Twenty per cent of Australia's drug and alcohol treatment services are being provided to people identifying cannabis as their principal drug of concern. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is often at high levels in illicit cannabis products, can exacerbate mental health conditions as well as range of other health conditions. Further information on cannabis harms can be accessed at: https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/marijuana.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While recreational use of cannabis remains illegal, the Government supports the needs of patients to access a safe, legal and reliable supply of medicinal cannabis products for the management of painful and chronic conditions. Information on Australia's medicinal cannabis licensing scheme can be found at: https://www.tga.gov.au/accessing-medicinal-cannabis-patient.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 7 November 2022 to the Hon Amanda Rishworth MP, Minister for Social Services, in relation to Child Care Subsidy (CCS) for grandparents who look after their grandchildren. As this matter falls within my portfolio responsibilities, your correspondence has been referred to me for reply.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises the valuable role that grandparents play in caring for their grandchildren either to support parents' workforce responsibilities or to provide care on a temporary or full-time basis when parents are unable or unwilling to do so.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">CCS is a payment to ensure early childhood education and care (ECEC) is affordable for families and designed to assist parents afford the genuine costs of commercial child care. It is not designed to subsidise child care that would otherwise occur within a typical extended family.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government also continues to support grandparents who help their families in difficult circumstances by being the principal carer of their grandchild(ren). Where a grandparent becomes the principal carer of their grandchild(ren), they are exempt from the CCS activity test and eligible for up to 100 hours of subsidised child care per fortnight, at a rate of up to 100 per cent of ECEC fees.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Prior to July 2018, the Registered Care program paid up to $35.95 per week to registered carers, including grandparents in some cases, for providing child care. However, the Productivity Commission, in its 2014 Inquiry into Childcare and Early Childhood Learning, concluded that the case for subsidising informal care arrangements such as grandparents caring for grandchildren was not strong given there were no educational qualifications or quality standards required for carers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While Registered Care is no longer available, the Government understands the cost-of-living pressures that families are facing and has committed to reducing the cost of ECEC to support working families get ahead. That is why from 10 July 2023, the Government increased the CCS rate for around 96 per cent of Australian families using ECEC earning less than $530,000—around 1.2 million families.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The changes to the CCS are just one of a number of measures the Government is taking to support families and invest in the early years to help all Australian children have the best possible start in life.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has directed the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to hold an inquiry into ECEC prices. The ACCC released its ECEC price inquiry interim report on 5 July 2023. The interim report provides early insight into the ACCC's investigations into prices, affordability and the market for ECEC. The ACCC will continue to conduct detailed sector analysis, gathering information about the cost of providing ECEC, and closely watching the pricing behaviour of providers as CCS increases take effect.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This will help shape the ACCC's September consultation paper which will include analysis of costs, the effectiveness of price regulation mechanisms and potential draft findings and recommendations. The ACCC's final report will be delivered to the Government by 31 December 2023.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has also commissioned a comprehensive Productivity Commission (the Commission) inquiry into Australia's ECEC system to help chart a course for universal, affordable ECEC. The inquiry will make recommendations to support affordable, accessible, equitable and high-quality ECEC that reduces barriers to workforce participation and supports children's learning and development. The Commission will release a draft report in November 2023 and provide a final report to the Government by 30 June 2024.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 8 July 2023 regarding petition EN4453 which requests the House of Representatives change the proposed Inland Rail line to bypass Wagga Wagga. I understand your email was not received on the date it was sent due to a technical error but I nonetheless apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 6 April 2023, the Australian Government released its response to the independent review of Inland Rail undertaken by Dr Keny Schott AO. The government has agreed or agreed in-principle to all 19 recommendations presented in Dr Schott's report. The report and government response are available at www.inlandrail.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Key findings of the review include that the route selected for Inland Rail is fit-for-purpose and that where it bisects a regional town, appropriate mitigations to limit noise and vibration and maintain cross town traffic flows should be implemented. With respect to Wagga Wagga, Dr Schott found that no immediate change should be made to the Inland Rail route, but bypass options should be investigated in the future should rail traffic significantly increase.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I can confirm that the NSW Government has requested the Australian Rail Track Corporation (ARTC) prepare a Preferred Infrastructure Report (PIR) to address concerns raised in submissions following the public exhibition of the draft Albury to Illabo Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The NSW Government has specifically directed ARTC to undertake further noise, vibration and traffic assessments in relation to Wagga Wagga to ensure that its proposed mitigations will address any such impacts to the town. Once completed, the PIR will be submitted to the NSW Government for acceptance as part of the regulated EIS approval process.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts will engage with the Department of Finance and ARTC to put in place oversight and monitoring oftrain movements, forecasts and impacts on communities as Inland Rail is delivered. This will inform decisions on future transport corridors.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I thank the Wagga Wagga community for bringing their concerns to my attention. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 8 November 2022 regarding Petition EN4468 which requests that the Australian Government establish a national public holiday to honour the late Queen Elizabeth II's memory. I understand there was an administrative error in the distribution of your letter. I sincerely apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The declaration of public holidays is the responsibility of the states and territories. Where a public holiday has been recognised nationally this has been agreed between the Prime Minister, State Premiers and Territory Chief Ministers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Many Australians share the view that Her Late Majesty Queen Elizabeth II was an extraordinary woman, not only for her 70 year service to the Commonwealth, but for the significant charitable work she carried out during her reign. Through her steadfast support for charities, Queen Elizabeth served as a role model for the whole Commonwealth and leaves a formidable legacy for the positive impact she had on Australia and the Commonwealth.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A National Memorial Service was held at Australian Parliament House on 22 September 2022, and broadcast to the nation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The day of the National Memorial Service was observed as a National Day of Mourning, and a one-off public holiday was held to allow the nation to view or attend the service, and provide an opportunity for all Australians to reflect on the life and service of Queen Elizabeth.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is not pursuing further public holidays to commemorate the life of Her Late Majesty.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing this petition to the Australian Government's attention.</span>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Australian Taxation Office</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN4657 regarding the Australian Taxation Office's (ATO) handling of Goods and Services Tax (GST) liabilities. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The GST is a consumption tax, which means, in economic terms, that the tax is charged on consumption transactions of households. GST is collected on the value added by each business in the production and distribution chain and then remitted to the ATO by businesses. This is achieved by taxing the full value of a business' sales and allowing the business a credit (called an input tax credit) for GST incurred on its acquisitions, with only the net amount being remitted. Input tax credits ensure GST is only collected on the value added by each business in the production and distribution chain and effectively reduces the GST on business inputs to zero. Under this framework, GST liabilities reflect tax that has been charged by businesses to households.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">GST liabilities generally reflect what has been reported by the business through self-assessment. However, the ATO may make amendments where it becomes aware that the information reported in the Business Activity Statement (BAS) may be incorrect. Businesses can also review, and correct information previously reported on a BAS, provided it falls within a four-year period of review. Where businesses think that the ATO has made an error in processing their BAS, they can contact the ATO to raise the issue and seek an amendment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If businesses are dissatisfied with the ATO's assessment resulting in a GST liability, they can exercise their review rights under Part IVC of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tax Administration Act 1953. </span>This includes lodging an objection to 'the ATO, as well as seeking external review rights with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or Federal Court of Australia where the taxpayer has already lodged an objection.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The ATO also provides taxpayers with assistance when addressing their tax liabilities, particularly when taxpayers find it difficult to repay their tax debts in full and on time. Where a GST liability arises, businesses may enter a payment arrangement which allows businesses to make repayments by instalments, including interest for late payments, over a fixed period until the balance is cleared. Businesses can contact the ATO to find out more about how the payment arrangements and other assistance available to their individual circumstances.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The ATO administers GST on behalf of the States and Territories. As the ATO 1s an independent statutory body that regulates taxes, the Government is not able to influence its administrative decisions. This extends to the ATO's communications to businesses and other taxpayers as well as the ATO's resourcing decisions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The ATO communicates the outcome of all small business compliance activities in writing. These finalisation letters include the contact details of the relevant compliance area and provide information on available objection and review rights to the decision. Where the compliance action results in a debt, specific information is included outlining this and the options available to the taxpayer to address the outstanding amount.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Generally, small businesses will also receive a notice of assessment which will include any amounts owing and a statement of account.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition raises concerns regarding the ATO's complaints processes. The ATO's website indicates that they aim to resolve complaints within fifteen business days. However, due to current increased volumes of work, the ATO has acknowledged that complaints may take up to thirty business days to resolve. Where taxpayers are not satisfied with the ATO's handling of their complaint or complaint outcome, taxpayers can contact the Inspector-General of Taxation and Taxation Ombudsman.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Neither the House nor Parliament conduct audits on the ATO. The Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) undertakes audits and provides independent reports and advice to Parliament, the Australian Government, and the community. The ANAO receives requests for audit from members and senators of the Parliament which may assist in considering what to include in the ANAO's audit work program. More information may need to be obtained before such a request can be made.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be of assistance to you.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence to the Minister for Communications, the Hon Michelle Rowland MP, concerning Petition EN4697 on introducing legislation for companies to enable consumers to unsubscribe to their services by the most simple and accessible means reasonably practicable. As this falls within my portfolio responsibilities, your correspondence was referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In February 2020 the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) was directed to conduct an inquiry into markets for the supply of digital platform services. Multiple reports published as part of the inquiry have highlighted the potential for an unfair trading prohibition to address concerns outlined in the petition, for example, by prohibiting unfair subscription trap behaviours which make it significantly more difficult for a consumer to end a subscription than to sign up.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At a meeting of Commonwealth, State and Territory Consumer Affairs Ministers in Adelaide in September 2022, Consumer Ministers agreed that Commonwealth Treasury would lead public consultation on options to combat unfair trading practices. I have released a Consultation Regulation Impact Statement for public consultation on this matter, and look forward to progressing this important work.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 18 May 2023 regarding petition EN4968 which relates to the retention and protection of personal information by companies. I welcome the opportunity to respond to this petition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to protecting Australians' personal information and to further strengthening privacy laws.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Privacy Act 1988 </span>(Privacy Act) regulates the handling of personal information about individuals. Relevant entities are required to take reasonable steps to protect personal info1mation they hold from misuse, interference and loss, as well as unauthorised access, modification or disclosure (Australian Privacy Principle 11). Where an entity no longer needs personal information for any purpose for which the information may be used or disclosed, under the Australian Privacy Principles the entity must take reasonable steps to destroy the information or ensure that it is de-identified.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Recent large-scale data breaches have highlighted the need to update and strengthen our laws to manage the immense amounts of personal info1mation collected about Australians. That is why the Government passed the <span style="font-style:italic;">Privacy Legislation Amendment (Enforcement and Other Measures) Act 2022 </span>which significantly increases maximum penalties under the Privacy Act, and provides the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) with enhanced enforcement powers. The passage of this law sends a clear message that entities must take privacy, security and data protection seriously.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government released the Attorney-General's Department's Review of the Privacy Act earlier this year, which will info1m future reforms to ensure the Act remains fit-for-purpose, supports an innovative economy and responds to new challenges in the digital age. The review included extensive consultation over a two-year period across industry, government and the general public.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet"> reinforce the existing requirement for entities to only collect what is reasonably necessary and to destroy personal information when it is no longer required.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further to this, the Review proposes significant reforms to strengthen the enforcement of the Privacy Act including new civil penalties and new powers for the lnfo1mation Commissioner in relation to investigations, public inquiries and determinations.

              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to privacy reforms, the Australian Government recognises the need to improve our national resilience to cyber threats and properly address the consequences of cyber incidents. The Australian Government will lead a nationally coordinated approach to building Australia's cyber security and resilience and lifting Australia's capability to meet the evolving challenges of cyberspace. To achieve this, the Minister for Cyber Security, the Hon. Clare O'Neil MP, has announced the development of the <span style="font-style:italic;">2023-2030 Australian Cyber Security Strategy </span>(the Strategy) which will outline the Australian Government's long-term vision for the future of Australian cyber security and the steps required to get there.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 22 May 2023 regarding Petition EN4998.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The signatories of this petition have expressed concern regarding the levels of gambling losses and harm experienced by Australians and are calling for the House of Representatives to ban gambling advertising on all Australian media.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Advertising regulation in Australia is intended to strike a balance between legitimate commercial interests and appropriate community safeguards. The Government recognises the imp01iance of gambling promotions being presented in a responsible manner.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to guaranteeing online gambling takes place under a robust legislative framework with strong consumer protections.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 28 June 2023, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs released the final report from its inquiry into online gambling and its impacts on those experience gambling harm. The comprehensive report makes 31 recommendations around consistent national consumer protections, online gambling regulation, and gambling adve1iising.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I have been clear in saying that the status quo of gambling advertising cannot continue and that any reform will need to address all platforms. The Government is currently considering the report and will respond to the recommendations in due course. More information about the inquiry, including the Committee's final report, can be found at:    <br clear="all">.</br>aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/House/Social_Policy_and_Legal_Affairs/Onlinegamblingimpacts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Reforms taken forward from the inqui1y will complement work the Government has already put in place to reduce gambling harms, including committing to ban credit cards for online wagering, progressing classification reform to protect children from simulated gambling in computer games, and implementing new evidence-based taglines to replace 'gamble responsibly' that convey the risks and potential harm from online wagering.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 21 August 2023, the Government launched BetStop, the national self-exclusion register for online wagering. The register allows individuals to self-exclude from Australian licensed wagering services (online and telephone) for a period of 3 months to a lifetime. BetStop is the tenth and final element of the National Consumer Protection Framework for online wagering to be implemented.</span>

For example, no gambling advertising or promotion of odds is allowed during play and no promotion of odds is allowed during breaks in play (such as halftime).

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Employment: Remuneration</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 22 May 2023 regarding a petition for an amendment to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fair Work Act 2009 </span>(Fair Work Act) to regulate job advertisements (EN5030), presented to the Standing Petitions Committee on the same date. I have considered the issues raised through the petition and the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations has consulted the Treasury, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Job advertisements provide businesses the opportunity to promote the benefits of their jobs to attract the right candidates. The current regulatory framework allows businesses the freedom to so while also preventing potential candidates from being misled.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, under Section 31 of the Australian Consumer Law (ACL), misleading conduct relating to offering employment is prohibited. This means that employers must not mislead those seeking employment about any matter relating to employment, including the availability, nature, terms or conditions of employment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The ACL is enforced by the ACCC, and state and territory consumer law regulators, under a 'one law, multiple regulators' model. Consumers and businesses can report misleading conduct relating to employment to the ACCC or to their local consumer protection agency.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">However only a court can decide whether Section 31 of the ACL has been breached. If a court determines there has been a contravention, it can impose pecuniary penalties or make other orders, such as remedial orders or an injunction.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Affected consumers also have a private right of action under the ACL. They can apply to a court to seek damages against a business that engages in misleading conduct in relation to employment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Employers also have an ongoing responsibility to classify and pay their workers correctly or risk being non-compliant with their workplace obligations. The FWO is the independent regulator responsible for providing advice, education and assistance about Australian workplace laws and impartially enforcing those laws. The FWO's guidance on job advertisements provides useful information on prohibited job advertisements and can be found at www.fairwork.gov.au/starting-employment/job-ads. In2022 the Government amended the Fair Work Act to ensure that job advertisements cannot include pay rates that would breach the Fair Work Act or a fair work instrument such as an award or enterprise agreement. This means that job advertisements cannot include pay rates that undercut employees' minimum entitlements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As highlighted by the petition, the Government amended the Fair Work Act to prohibit pay secrecy clauses in employment contracts, improving transparency in workplaces. Pay secrecy clauses included in new employment contracts since 7 December2022 will have no effect. Furthermore, from 7 June2023 these clauses became prohibited and their inclusion in employment contracts will attract penalties. The key aim of this reform is to improve gender pay equity and reduce the risk of discrimination, such as where two people are paid differently for doing the same job, by removing legal prohibitions on workers discussing their own pay. This gives employees the right to disclose their pay to others if they want to, as well ask other employees about their remuneration.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Through these laws as enforced by the ACCC, the courts and the FWO, the Australian Government is striving to strike the right balance to ensure job advertisements are fair, without misleading potential candidates, while providing businesses with the opportunity to promote their place of work.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing to me regarding these important issues and the petition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Yours sincerely</span>

            <p class="HPS-SubDebate" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Central West New South Wales: Floods</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 20 June 2023, enclosing Petition EN5065, with 9 signatures, proposing a resilience package is legislated for Cabonne, New South Wales (NSW).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I know first-hand from my visits to flood-impacted communities across NSW and Queensland—including communities in Cabonne and across the Central West—that the flooding events that began in November 2021 and continued through the first half of last year have had devastating effects on people. That is why the Commonwealth has committed a significant amount of support across both states.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">State and territory governments have primary responsibility for responding to disasters and providing immediate assistance to impacted communities. The Australian Government supports the states with the costs of providing relief and recovery assistance to communitie5 through the jointly-funded Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements (DRFA).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the DRFA, states and territories determine the type and level of assistance to make available following a disaster. Importantly, these jurisdictions are not bound by the DRFA, and can make available whatever assistance they deem necessary, regardless of whether it is eligible for cost sharing under the DRFA. This recognises that states and territories are best placed to identify the type and level of assistance to make available following a disaster, in accordance with their responsibility for disaster management.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In response to the severe weather and flooding from September 2022 onwards, the Australian and New South Wales (NSW) Governments made a range of recovery assistance available under the DRFA across impacted Local Government Areas, including Cabonne. Information on available recovery assistance can be found at www.disasterassist.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Extraordinary recovery measures under the DRFA, beyond the immediate supports provided like emergency payments and support for council clean ups, must be requested by a state premier or chief minister. These packages are considered by the Prime Minister for agreement.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Resilient Homes funds in the Northern Rivers ofNSW and in Queensland were both approved by the Prime Minister following a request from the respective state governmen:s. This included an agreement by both states to equally cost share the assistance. These measures are not legislated by the Australian Parliament.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The NSW Reconstruction Authority (NSWRA) is the body responsible for disaster recovery in NSW. Officials from the National Emergency Management Agency have relayed the terms ofPetition EN5065 to the NSWRA for consideration.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth recognises the importance in investing in disaster resilience and mitigation, to ensure communities are better prepared for the natural disasters they will face in the future. That's why we have also committed up to $1 billion in Commonwealth funding over five years for our flagship Disaster Ready Fund, to fund disaster resilience and mitigation projects across the country. The first round ofthe Disaster Ready Fund, announced earlier this year, included funding for the Cabonne Council to help deliver risk reduction equipment, a critical evacuation centre and early warning systems for improved disaster response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government continues to work closely with the NSW Government to ensure necessary assistance and additional support is provided to affected communities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for bringing Petition EN5065 to my attention. </span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 1 August 2023 to the Hon Tony Burke MP, Minister for the Arts, about petition EN5113 regarding the request from petitioners to review and limit the proliferation of Indian Hindutva films, such as <span style="font-style:italic;">The Kerala Story </span>and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Kashmir Files. </span>Your email was referred to me, as classification policy falls within my portfolio responsibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The National Classification Scheme (the Scheme) regulates the classification and availability of films, computer games and certain publications within Australia. The Scheme is a co-operative scheme between the federal, state and territory governments. Under the Scheme, classification is a federal government responsibility, and enforcement of the Scheme is a state and territory responsibility.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the Scheme, the Classification Board (the Board) makes decisions about films, computer games and certain publications. The Board is a statutory body, independent of government. When making decisions, the Board applies the <span style="font-style:italic;">Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 </span>(the Act), the National Classification Code (the Code) and the relevant classification guidelines. The Act, the Code and the guidelines can be found at www.classification.gov.au. The guidelines are jointly agreed to by the Commonwealth and state and territory governments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Act states that, when classifying content, the Board is to consider:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">(a) the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults; and</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">(b) the literary, artistic or educational merit (if any) of the publication, film or computer game; and</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">(c) the general character of the publication, film or computer game, including whether it is of a medical, legal or scientific character; and</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">(d) the persons or class of persons to or amongst whom it is published or is intended or likely to be published.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Code provides that classification decisions should give effect, as far as possible, to the principles that adults should be able to read, hear and see what they want, while recognising that minors should be protected from material likely to harm them, and all Australians should be protected from offensive, unsolicited material as well as the need to take account of community concerns about depictions that condone or incite violence, particularly sexual violence, and the portrayal of persons in a demeaning manner.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The classification categories for film are: G (General), PG (Parental Guidance), M (Mature), MA 15+ (Mature Accompanied), R 18+ (Restricted), X 18+ (Restricted) and RC (Refused Classification). The type of content permissible in each classification is described in the Guidelines for the Classification of Films (Film Guidelines) and the consideration of impact and context are essential principles in the use of the Film Guidelines. When classifying a film, the Board assesses the impact of six classifiable elements: themes, violence, sex, language, drug use, and nudity.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 10 March 2022, the Board classified <span style="font-style:italic;">The Kashmir Files, </span>R 18+ with consumer advice of 'High Impact themes and violence'. The Board noted that <span style="font-style:italic;">The Kashmir Files </span>contains high impact themes and violence, including themes of brutal repression, which are, at times, inextricably linked within the narrative of the film. A film classified R18+ may not be sold or exhibited to persons under 18 years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 9 May 2023, the Board classified <span style="font-style:italic;">The Kera/a Story, </span>MA 15+ with consumer advice of 'Strong themes, violence and sexual violence'. The Board noted that <span style="font-style:italic;">The Kera/a Story </span>contains strong themes and violence, including sexual violence, which are justified by context and inextricably linked through the narrative of the film. A film classified MA 15+ is considered unsuitable for persons under 15 years and is a legally restricted category.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In certain circumstances, a person may apply to the Classification Review Board for a review of a classification decision.

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 1 August 2023 regarding Petition EN5150—Wages linked to the Consumer Price Index or Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cash rate.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government understands that many households are doing it tough from cost-of-living pressures and higher interest rates. Inflation peaked at the end of last year and has begun to moderate, with the RBA signalling higher wages growth for the rest of the year.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Minimum and award wages are set each year by the independent Fair Work Commission's Expert Panel for Annual Wage Reviews. In making its decision, the Expert Panel is required to take into account the performance and competitiveness of the economy, the likely impact on business, and relative living standards and the needs of the low paid. In this year's Annual Wage Review, the Expert Panel awarded an above-inflation increase to the National Minimum Wage of 8.6 per cent and increased award wages by 5.75 per cent. These increases, the highest on record, took effect from 1 July 2023.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to this guaranteed minimum wage for all employees, wages may be set under enterprise agreements or individual arrangements. The Government is working to ensure workers have access to a stronger workplace bargaining system that will help lift wages and improve job security. For instance, the recent Secure Jobs, Better Pay reforms removed barriers to single-enterprise bargaining and provide more options for business and employees to make multi-enterprise agreements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Government understands access to safe and affordable housing is central to the security and dignity of all Australians.

There are dwellings remaining in the Scheme which will continue to offer reduced rents until 2026. It was announced in the 2014-15 Budget, there will be no further funding rounds or new allocations of NRAS incentives beyond those currently allocated in the Scheme and held by approved participants.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">At the conclusion of the Scheme, NRAS dwellings will remain subject to all relevant state and territory government tenancy laws, with respect to lease agreements and rental increases. Some NRAS allocations are held by endorsed charities, which includes Community Housing Providers (CHPs). Some CHPs may continue to offer reduced rents.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">At National Cabinet in August this year the Commonwealth, state and territory governments committed to <span style="font-weight:bold;">A Better Deal for Renters </span>to harmonise and strengthen renters' rights across Australia. This included developing a nationally consistent framework including a requirement for genuine reasonable grounds for eviction, moving towards limiting rental increases to once a year and phasing in minimum rental standards.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is concerned about the disruptions to access to Nagorno-Karabakh via the Lachin Corridor and humanitarian impacts on the people of that region. Australia supports the UN Secretary General's position of 2 August 2023, when he called for urgent steps to facilitate access for delivery of humanitarian assistance to people in need. Australia supports the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross and calls on all parties to ensure that humanitarian aid is provided to all in need without obstruction.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We support the provisional measures order issued by the International Court of Justice on 22 February 2023, which was reaffirmed by the Court on 6 July 2023. The Court ordered Azerbaijan to "take all measures at its disposal to ensure unimpeded movement of persons, vehicles and cargo along the Lachin Corridor in both directions."</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia values our relations with both Armenia and Azerbaijan. We monitor the situation in the South Caucasus and acknowledge the positions of the respective parties. We actively convey our views and concerns to both parties through diplomatic channels, including that we support international mediation efforts to bring their leaders together around the table. We also encourage both countries to grasp the opportunity to reach an agreement that guarantees the rights and security of the inhabitants of Nagorno-Karabakh and recognises the sovereignty and territorial integrity of both Armenia and Azerbaijan.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 1 August 2023 concerning Petition EN5214 requesting the House to remove the biosecurity levy for Australian farmers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Government understands the vital importance of biosecurity in protecting our economy and our way of life. That is why we committed, and delivered, long-term sustainable funding that will go directly to strengthening Australia's biosecurity system. This includes new funding of over $1 billion over four years and $267 million per year ongoing from 2027-28. This ongoing increase in funding for biosecurity is permanent.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Everyone has a role to play in strengthening Australia's biosecurity system, including contributing to its cost. To complement the permanent increases in biosecurity funding, we are making changes to ensure the way biosecurity is funded is more equitable.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We have committed more taxpayer funding to biosecurity than ever before and we are asking risk creators, as well as those who benefit from strong biosecurity protection to make additional contributions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To help meet the cost of sustainably funding the biosecurity system, a new biosecurity protection levy on agriculture, fisheries and forestry producers will commence from 1 July 2024. The funds raised through the new biosecurity protection levy will form part of consolidated revenue and will be provided back to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry as part of the committed ongoing appropriation. This will help maintain the department's policy, operational and technical functions on a sustainable basis.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Importers will also be paying more, with a new cost recovery charge on low value ($1,000 or less) goods imported into Australia, also commencing on 1 July 2024. The Passenger Movement Charge is also being increased from $60 to $70 per person from 1 July 2024.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, from 1 July 2023 the government increased its cost recovery for delivering biosecurity activities for risk creators and importers. An average price increase of 28 per cent across biosecurity fee and charge points commenced this year and now fully reflect costs for the first time since 2015.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This means that in 2024-25, 44 per cent (or around $350.9 million) of Commonwealth biosecurity funding will be covered by the government through ongoing taxpayer funding. Importers will be paying 48 per cent or around $390.7 million, primary producers will contribute 6 per cent or around $47.5 million and Australia Post will contribute 2 per cent or around $15.4 million.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I appreciate that farming is a tough and often an unpredictable business. However, primary producers, whether growing for the domestic market or exporting into premium overseas markets, benefit considerably from our favourable biosecurity status. Due in part to the considerable prevention efforts at the border we continue to be one of the few countries in the world that remains free from the world's most invasive pests and diseases. This gives us access to markets that other countries cannot export to, or need to undergo expensive pest and disease treatments before they are able to export.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge that many producers invest in on-farm biosecurity as well as indirectly through industry-led agricultural levies supporting research and development, marketing, residue testing, and levies received by Animal Health Australia and Plant Health Australia. However, producers do not contribute directly to the cost of the Commonwealth biosecurity effort to prevent pests and diseases entering Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth has a legislative responsibility, primarily at the border, to manage biosecurity risks to protect Australia's animal, plant and human health status and to maintain market access for our food and other agricultural exports. In addition to frontline biosecurity services, the funding will help deliver:</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 24 November 2022 in relation to the petition presented to the House on 23 November 2022 by Ms Lisa Chesters MP, Member for Bendigo, regarding wages and conditions for early childhood educators and teachers. Unfortunately, due to a technical error, your correspondence was not received by my office until 16 August 2023. I regret the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I would like to thank Ms Chesters for presenting this petition to the House on the behalf of 3,923 constituents. Supporting the early childhood education and care (ECEC) workforce to provide children with access to high quality ECEC is a priority for the Australian Government. Central to this is the need to ensure ECEC educators and teachers are valued as professionals, with rewarding career opportunities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has strengthened the ability and capacity of the FWC to order pay increases for workers in low paid, female-dominated industries through the <span style="font-style:italic;">Secure Jobs, Better Pay Act 2022. </span>The Government has also modernised the bargaining system by expanding access to collective bargaining for lower-paid sectors (including ECEC) through the supported bargaining stream, which commenced on 6 June 2023. The Government will assist with the Fair Work Commission's processes as required.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The FWC also delivered their Annual Wage Review for 2022-23 recently, which included a 5.75 per cent increase to awards from 1 July 2023. This was a historic pay rise, which included awards covering ECEC educators and teachers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The ECEC sector will also benefit from the Government's commitment to improve workforce supply through Fee Free TAFE, additional university places, teacher bursaries, expanding the migration program and the establishment of Jobs and Skills Australia to support workforce planning.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the 2023-24 Budget, the Government also announced three new measures, representing a total investment of $72.4 million, to greater support the skills and training of the ECEC workforce. This includes supporting ECEC educators, teachers and centre managers to undertake professional development training and supporting teachers to undertake paid practicum placements or participate in a practicum exchange program.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, all governments and the sector have co-designed the IO-year National Children's Education and Care Workforce Strategy (the Strategy), which was released in October 2021. The Strategy includes 21 practical actions that aim to address the long-term and persistent issues impacting attraction, retention, and quality of the ECEC workforce. Action 1-1 of the Strategy involves research to investigate options to improve pay and conditions in the ECEC sector, with key findings to be discussed at the ECEC Biennial National Workforce Forum in late 2023. Further information on the Strategy is available at www.education.gov.au/early-childhood-workforce/national-childrens-education-and-care-workforce-strategy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I will continue to meet with key stakeholders to understand the issues facing the sector and the role the Government can play to support the ECEC workforce.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information is of assistance.</span>

As you know, once a petition is presented in the House, the committee may refer it to the minister responsible for the administration of the matters raised in the petition. Under the standing orders, a minister is then expected to provide a written response to the petition within 90 days. While most petitions are responded to within this time frame, certain obstacles may cause a delay, including petitions where responsibility could sit with more than one minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The secretariat has been working with ministers' offices to arrange for overdue responses to be provided as soon as possible. On behalf of the committee, I'd like to express our appreciation at their positive and cooperative response, and I look forward to presenting a bumper crop of ministerial responses on the next sitting Monday.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a related note, the committee is continuing to consider whether a petition should have a minimum number of signatures before it is referred to a minister for a response. Following the public survey hosted on the parliament's website in August, the committee wrote to all members seeking their views on the matter. The committee will consider feedback received at our meeting this week. Of course, any changes made to the petitions process will be reported to the House and clearly explained to the public on the website.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now, thousands of Brisbanites are affected by constant, unrelenting flight noise. All they're asking for is a decent night's sleep, a simple request met with utter disdain and hostility from Brisbane Airport Corporation, from Airservices Australia, from the political establishment and from this Labor government.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Airservices Australia have wasted countless hours and resources, giving false hope to residents with their fake consultation processes. Brisbane Airport Corporation runs attack stories in the media against anyone who dares to question their right to make enormous profits at the expense of residents. The reaction of the transport minister was to simply dare the affected residents to go out and protest. Be careful what you wish for, Minister! </span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The contemptuous treatment of affected residents was exemplified a few weeks ago by Queensland Deputy Premier Steven Miles labelling those affected 'inner city elites'. The irony of someone on $380,000 a year speaking to a room full of aviation CEOs and lobbyists calling everyday people 'elites' is breathtaking, and it was not lost on residents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If Steven Miles and the Queensland Labor government are more interested in the profits of Brisbane Airport Corporation and the airline companies than they are in the wellbeing of everyday residents in these areas, their seats will be in grave danger at the 2024 state election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The latest spin from Brisbane Airport Corporation is that somehow regional Queenslanders would lose out if caps and curfews were implemented. Dividing Queenslanders between those who live in the city and those who live in the regions—a pretty hackneyed political strategy that everyday people see right through. They know regional flights get cut when privately run airlines and airports are willing to sacrifice regional Queenslanders to corporate profits. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The solution to this? Simple! Take the profit motive out of the equation. We need to reconsider public ownership in this sector. It's clear that the current system—in which monopolies like that of Qantas and its subsidiaries control around 60 per cent of the domestic aviation market—is not working. Another monopoly, Airport Coordination Australia, controls airport slot management at most of Australia's major airports, and, extraordinarily, ACA is majority owned by Qantas and Virgin. They are effectively selling slots to themselves! And the monopoly Brisbane Airport Corporation, who are determined to double flights through Brisbane, exacerbating flight noise, all in the relentless pursuit of profit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the medium to long term, publicly owned high-speed rail also needs to be part of the conversation. This has obvious benefits not just in flight noise reduction but also in the decarbonisation of the transport sector more broadly. Sadly, this opportunity is being squandered under the Labor government's plan. It is unlikely that high-speed rail connecting Brisbane to Melbourne via Sydney and Canberra would be completed before the mid-2060s; this is despite a comprehensive report written by research institute Beyond Zero Emissions in 2014 that shows that such a route could be built in just 10 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fundamentally, all this demonstrates the absolute corporate capture of what should be essential public services: airlines, airports and regulators. This is a consequence of the sell-off of public assets primarily by the Hawke-Keating Labor government in the eighties and nineties. Qantas and airports have been privatised. Airservices Australia, tasked with regulating our airspace to prioritise safety and reduce impacts on communities, is similarly 'corporatised' and relies on airline revenue to function.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This needs to be fixed. The residents of Brisbane should have the same rights as other Australians: the right to a good night's sleep.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:10</span>):  I second the bill. Brisbane now suffers from the worst flight noise in Australia. The opening of the second runway in 2020 has been having an enormously detrimental impact on people's sleep, health and wellbeing across Brisbane suburbs. Airservices Australia's last annual report showed more complaints for Brisbane Airport than all other major Australian airports combined. Despite thousands of residents' participation in official government processes, complaints and reviews, the government has only offered token consultation and window-dressing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Brisbane Airport Curfew and Demand Management Bill 2023 will force real change to curb flight noise; introduce reasonable restrictions, including implementing a night-time curfew on flights from 10 pm to 6 am so that residents can get a good night's sleep; a total cap on flights at 45 flights per hour to manage relentless noise throughout the day; and a new long-term operating plan to prioritise more flights over the water. Noise reduction mechanisms like this are already in place and providing relief for other communities near airports across Australia, including at Sydney airport, which has had both a cap and a curfew since 1997. Obviously, it hasn't stopped Sydney from being a thriving world city—and with some of the cheapest flights in the country. The Prime Minister himself was a strong advocate for noise reduction when it was affecting his own inner Sydney seat. If a cap and curfew on flights is good enough for Sydney, then it should be good enough for residents of Brisbane.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It can be hard, I think, for people not living directly under the flight paths to appreciate how severely impacted residents are by this issue, particularly while the airport and government are working overtime to tell people there's no problem. As one constituent in Griffith, Erin, told me: 'The constant waking through the night from the noise is affecting our health and wellbeing. We have a small two-bedroom Queensland cottage and the noise from the planes rattles our entire house when a plane goes over, and we are struggling to even hear each other talk. My toddler is absolutely terrified and now constantly waking all through the night from the ridiculously loud planes at all hours.' Megan, who lives in Dutton Park, told me: 'Each night I am constantly woken by airplanes over our home, particularly around 2 am to 3 am. Then from 5.50 am to 7 am we have a constant stream of low-flying aircraft over our home—almost every three minutes. In the evenings, the aircraft fly over constantly between 7.30 pm to almost midnight. The planes rattle our windows and we cannot hear each other speak, nor the television—particularly for my four-year-old who enjoys a bit of ABC Kids. The disrupted sleep every night is unbearable. When we purchased our home there was next to no aircraft noise. One day it was like a switch: the aircraft noise started and it has never stopped.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are thousands of stories like this across the community. That the minister for infrastructure and transport is now refusing to meet with the community campaigners advocating for change is shameful; I am certain that the airport corporation has no trouble getting access. We know that Brisbane Airport Corporation's ambition is to double flights over the city by 2035. What's worse is that the government's own aviation green paper predicts a tripling of flight movements by 2050. This is just madness when we consider the impacts of noise, air pollution and CO2 emissions. You would think that instead of tripling flight movements by 2050, we might instead be finally building high-speed rail in this country, connecting three of the busiest air routes in the world and decarbonising our travel. But since the sell-off of our major airports and the national carrier in the nineties, we've now created a powerful corporate lobby group who have fought to protect any threats, like noise protections or high-speed rail, from growing their profits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of the day, this is a fight led by everybody: by people standing up against the greed of big corporations and against Labor and the coalition, who are held captive by the airline corporations. The Greens will always stand with the people in that fight. The community is tired of playing by airports rules, tired of being lied to and tired of giving up their lives to participate in endless technical reviews and sham consultations that go nowhere.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The robodebt royal commission resulted in 57 recommendations, as well as endorsements of other inquiry recommendations, to strengthen the Public Service and ensure robodebt cannot be repeated. The government has expressed some willingness to implement reform to prevent robodebt from happening again, but we need oversight of that implementation program by a parliamentary committee to hold the government to account and ensure that our Public Service is reformed as needed. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent years we've seen the consequences of the hollowing out and politicisation of the Australian Public Service. We've been appalled to see the impact of this in the robodebt debacle. The royal commission into robodebt found that robodebt was a crude and cruel mechanism, neither fair nor legal, and that it made many people feel like criminals. In essence, people were traumatised on the off-chance they might owe money. It was a costly failure of public administration in both human and economic terms. The report highlighted the venality, incompetence and cowardice that characterised the scheme. So how did this happen? In short, the government of the day agreed to robodebt with no regard for its impact on disadvantaged Australians, and the Public Service, in its desire to please ministers, suggested it, implemented it and defended it, despite knowing of its unlawfulness. We must respond to this in two ways. Firstly, the people responsible for robodebt must be held to account. This should be happening through the referrals that came out of the royal commission. Secondly, we must ensure that our system is reformed so this cannot happen again. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under our system of government, the Public Service is meant to provide frank and fearless advice to the government of the day. This failed. We've known for a long time that our Public Service is not equipped to do its job. In 2019, the Thodey review confirmed that APS capability is no longer fit for purpose. That report said:</span>

We invest taxpayers' money in doing the work and deciding what's needed through parliamentary committees, royal commissions and external reviews; then we just ignore them.

But, in a noisy world of competing priorities, greater accountability may not remain a key priority now that they are the ones to be held accountable.</span>

While its introduction shows that the government has some intention to begin reform, the bill does not represent substantive change. It doesn't begin to address fundamental roles, structures, hierarchies and practices that need reform.

It would report parliament every six months on the progress in implementing those recommendations.</span>

Without some direct and regular accountability, it will be too easy for a busy government to reject the hard parts and make only cosmetic changes. Australians need to know that the work invested in the royal commission will not go to waste and that the government is committed to and accountable for Public Service reform.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Public Service is a fundamental pillar of our democracy. Its values, its integrity and its core principle of providing impartial and independent advice are things that we cannot and must not take for granted. However, our faith in the independence and integrity of the Public Service has been rocked in recent years, with scandals such as the illegal robodebt scheme and, more recently, the ugly revelations of the politically and personally motivated machinations of one of the most powerful public servants in the country, Michael Pezzullo.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the last election, trust in our political institutions and politicians was at an all-time low. The implementation of the National Anti-Corruption Commission earlier this year has been a positive step forward, but it's been just that: a first step in rebuilding trust in our democracy. The National Anti-Corruption Commission is limited by the fact that it can only investigate alleged corruption or political malfeasance after it has occurred. It does not prevent corruption from occurring in the first place. We must build integrity infrastructure into every corner, nook and cranny of our democracy, including the mighty Australian Public Service. Implementing the robodebt royal commission recommendations in full will further this goal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's constituents in the electorate of Mackellar were horrified and deeply saddened by the evidence presented to and the findings of the robodebt royal commission. Royal commissioner Catherine Holmes SC concluded that 'robodebt was a crude and cruel mechanism, neither fair nor legal', and the CEO of the Australian Council of Social Service decried the scheme as an 'aggressive abuse of government power'. Of particular note are the comments by Commissioner Holmes, who described in her reports as 'remarkable' 'the lengths to which public servants were prepared to go to oblige ministers on a quest for savings'. Even if the failings were driven largely by a few rogue actors, such as the former head of the Department of Human Services, it is nevertheless clear that the APS as an institution failed Australians in a most devastating way. Add to that the more recent example of the scandal involving the Secretary of the Department of Home Affairs, Michael Pezzullo. Cultural issues run very deep when a secretary of a department thinks he has the right to influence who is appointed as his minister, works against ministers not to his liking, pushes to supress media freedoms and generally inserts himself into the political process over a five-year period. In both cases the culture of providing frank and fearless advice dismally failed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In light of these two egregious examples it is clear it will not be easy or a simple thing to fix the culture in the Public Service, but it is critical that we get it done and we get it done well. The integrity of our democracy depends on it. It is the duty of each one of us as parliamentarians to actively ensure that an occurrence such as robodebt never happens again and that our Public Service is as robust as possible and functioning in accordance to its values. Therefore, the implementation of the royal commission's recommendations must be done as transparently as possible so that we as parliamentarians have the information required to hold the government and the process to account. To be able to do that, federal parliamentarians need to be informed and kept up to date on the progress of the implementation of the commission's recommendations. To that end, as the member for Curtin has proposed, there must be both a joint select committee overseeing the implementation process and regular reporting to parliament every six months on progress. Explanations must be provided if the implementation is not proceeding as expected or is delayed. This is how we guarantee that the royal commission recommendations are implemented in full and in a timely manner. This is how we help rebuild the public's trust in our political system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The future integrity and strength of our Public Service and hence our democracy depend on the fulsome incorporation of the royal commission's recommendations, so I urge the government and all members of this House to support the member for Curtin's motion to establish a joint select committee to oversee the implementation of the robodebt royal commission's recommendations and six monthly reporting on the progress to parliament. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:26</span>):  I thank the member for Curtin for bringing this important matter. The income compliance programs, collectively known as robodebt, was one of most shameful chapters in the history of the previous government. Starting in 2015 the former Liberal-National government deliberately targeted the most vulnerable in our community. They raised debts against them—debts that never existed—and then they pursued those debts, pursued vulnerable Australians, despite advice that there was no legal nor logical basis for them. Think of the power imbalance: the government upon whom you depend for your income to survive is pursuing you for a debt, and you are required to prove the debt doesn't exist, even though it might go back many years and you may not have records anymore, but the government has no onus on it to prove the debt actually existed in the first place. For Australians already doing it tough, already on the margins, this additional stress—the marginalisation that goes with being labelled a 'welfare cheat'—we know pushed some of them over the edge. The impact of this shameful period on the lives of individual Australians—over 434,000 Australians had debts raised against them that have since been refunded or zeroed—and the stress cannot be undone, and robodebt was only ceased as a result of a class action. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Commissioner Holmes has said the disastrous effects of robodebt became apparent in September 2016, and the beginning of 2017 was the point at which robodebt's unfairness, probable illegality and cruelty became apparent. Instead the path was taken to double-down, to go on the attack in the media against those who complained and to maintain the falsehood that in fact the system had not changed at all. It took a class action that meant vulnerable Australians who had been targeted had to take the government to court in order for it to be ceased. Justice Murphy, the judge presiding over the case, approved the largest class action settlement in Australian history, and he described the robodebt scheme as 'a shameful chapter and massive failure in public administration'. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government established the royal commission into robodebt as part of our election commitments. The evidence from the royal commission was shocking: the evidence both from those affected and from the various Liberal ministers responsible for robodebt and the senior public servants who enabled it. Commissioner Catherine Holmes handed down the final report in July 2023, and it has since been tabled and is publicly available. It was important that there be an independent process, separate from the politics of this place, in order to examine what really happened; who knew what, and when; and to hear from the Australians who'd been targeted, vilified and pursued without cause by their own government. The report is the summary of 46 days of public hearings and over a hundred witnesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite efforts to dismiss the royal commission as a witch hunt, by the Leader of the Opposition, Peter Dutton—himself a part of the former coalition cabinet that ticked off the major decisions that enabled robodebt—the evidence is harrowing. It was important that this evidence see the light of day and not remain hidden away to protect those who oversaw it. Australians deserve justice. They deserve to know that their government is there to protect them, not to use them unlawfully to try and balance their budget or score political points through anti-welfare populism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission report contains 57 recommendations. The way forward on these is currently being considered by the minister. Such shameful and illegal schemes must never happen again. Australians deserve better.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is remarkable how little interest there seems to have been in ensuring the scheme's legality … Truly dismaying was the revelation of dishonesty and collusion to prevent the scheme's lack of legal foundation coming to light.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Robodebt was a crude and cruel mechanism, neither fair nor legal, and it made many people feel like criminals.

I'm always prepared to speak in this place on the disgrace that was robodebt. Shortly after my own election in 2016, I labelled it a 'criminal enterprise'. I said that it was government sponsored, government authorised theft, and I've been proven right. Money was stolen from Australians. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For four years, under the previous Liberal government, robodebt unfairly and illegally mounted debts against innocent Australians who deserve help and support from their government but got anything but. They were humiliated, vilified and made to feel like criminals. From early 2015 to November 2019, robodebt unlawfully raised $1.8 billion of debt against around 435,000 Australians. These Australians received illegal and unfounded debts during a time that they should have been receiving support from the government through our social safety net. Instead of that support, they were demonised and forced to pay back debts, many of which turned out to be nothing more than fictitious, unfounded and ultimately illegal.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This campaign against welfare recipients did not end until November 2019. Remember, I'd been elected in July 2016. We'd been warning for two years about this scheme. They didn't end it until November 2019, on the very day that ministers and senior public servants would have had to give evidence in the class action against the Commonwealth. It was only at this point that the previous government finally admitted it had no legal basis for raising those debts against those 435,000 Australians. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Coming into government, Labor was determined to end and make right this disgraceful chapter in Australia's history. We took a royal commission into robodebt to the 2022 federal election as a commitment, and on 25 August last year the Albanese government delivered on the pledge. The royal commission exposed the terrible truths of the campaign against welfare recipients by the Liberals via robodebt. The complacency and the willingness of cabinet ministers and senior public officials to turn a blind eye to this heinous scheme was also brought to light with the final, scarifying report handed down by Commissioner Holmes on 7 July 2023. It's important to remember at this time that the royal commission was an independent process overseen very ably by Commissioner Holmes. Following the royal commission and the handing down of Commissioner Holmes's final report, the government is taking time to consider the 57 recommendations that were made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important we acknowledge and implement recommendations with the victims of robodebt in mind. The evidence given throughout the royal commission was incredibly disturbing, especially that regarding the conduct of former Liberal ministers who implemented and oversaw the scheme for more 4½ years with the knowledge and reservations that the scheme was illegal and certainly immoral. Over 46 days of public hearings, Australia heard from more than 100 witnesses who gave heartbreaking and infuriating accounts of their experiences of robodebt—vulnerable people hounded by their government, with no way of defending themselves or fighting back. To those Australians, I'm sorry. To the 11,269 Tasmanians—2,505 of which are constituents of mine in Lyons—I'm sorry that you experienced that heartlessness from the former government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite all we have learned and now know, many in the Liberal Party appear to feel that nothing was wrong. The Leader of the Opposition said, when the royal commission was announced, that it was nothing more than a political 'witch-hunt'—this from a man who wants to lead our country and once again exert control over the welfare system and the lives of the people who dependent upon it. Robodebt is a shameful part, perhaps one of the most shameful parts, of Australia's history and the darkest of all marks against the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments. It's something I, and the 435,000 victims of robodebt, will never let the Liberals forget. They caused this mess, and vulnerable Australians have paid the price. The government is now considering the royal commission's recommendations, and it will ensure that such an atrocity never happens again.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to move this motion. Australia's free trade agreement with the United Kingdom is one of our most comprehensive, innovative and ambitious trade agreements, and it has ushered in a new era in our economic relationship with the UK. The United Kingdom is one of Australia's major trading partners, with two-way trade worth $10 billion in 2022 and two-way services trade worth over $11 billion in 2021-22, making it our second-largest services trading partner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this agreement, over 99 per cent of Australia's products will enter the United Kingdom duty free, and these include some of our key exports such as wine, rice, sugar, honey, nuts, olive oil and food supplements. The UK tariffs on Australia industrial goods are eliminated, including on auto parts, electrical and fashion items. Australia's agricultural products will have duty-free transition quotas, with the eventual elimination of all tariffs, and this includes on beef and sheep meat, and sugar and dairy products. For Australian consumers, tariffs on 98 per cent of UK imports to Australia are eliminated, with the rest to be removed within six years. By reducing tariffs, the agreement is increasing the choice of everyday household items and driving down the cost-of-living pressures, and that's passed on to consumers both in Australia and in the UK. This trade agreement makes it easier and cheaper for Australian businesses to export our homegrown products to the UK. In the first month that the trade agreement entered into force, Australia's exports to the United Kingdom increased by almost 200 per cent from the same time last year. After a short transition period, all of Australia's imports from the UK will be tariff free.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1879, during colonial times, the first ever export of frozen red meat travelled from Australia to the United Kingdom—obviously by boat. Since then our global red meat exports have grown to nearly A$14 billion per year. Under this trade agreement, increasing volumes of Australian red meat can be exported to the UK tariff free, and this will see us grow the value of Australian red meat by exporting it to where the demand is, making it more affordable for people in the UK to buy Australia's high-quality meat product.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, in my electorate of Blair, JBS Australia announced it would create 500 new jobs at its Dinmore processing facility to support local employment and increased demand for Aussie beef. JBS Dinmore is one of the leading exporters of red meat in the country, with approximately 10 per cent of Australia's total beef processing capacity. It produces a wide range of beef brands that are supplied to overseas markets. JBS Dinmore, in my electorate, stands to benefit from this deal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The removal of tariffs on sugar reopens what was a thriving market for us before the UK joined the European Economic Community in 1973. When I was in the UK a few years ago they were very keen, in the post-Brexit era, to return to their old friends, including Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just tariffs that are removed under this agreement. This agreement makes it easier for Australian professionals, service providers and investors to do business in the UK market. Australian businesses can access skilled workers from the UK, including innovators and early career professionals, to meet local demand, thanks to new mobility pathways. The agreement strengthens our people-to-people links with the UK. Australian professionals will have the same access to UK job markets as nationals from the European Union, except those from Ireland. This agreement includes measures designed to improve the mobility of skilled workers and young people in both directions. From 31 January next year, Australians up to the age of 35—up from the current age of 30—will be able to apply for working holidays in the UK and stay for a maximum of three years instead of two.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's financial services sector stands to benefit from preferential access to the UK's vibrant fintech ecosystem. Under this trade agreement the removal of localised data-hosting requirements is a game changer which will allow businesses to plan their growth, knowing they can collect, process and transfer data between the UK and Australia without facing unnecessary hurdles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just through the bottom line that Australia and the UK benefit from this agreement; it's also through the exchange and transfer of world-class skills, ideas, innovations and inventions, which will make our lives better. The implementation of this trade diversification agenda under Minister Don Farrell is a very important one, and I commend him for his work, particularly the work in the EU.</span>

I note that at the end he acknowledged the current minister, Don Farrell. I commend the current government for ratifying this deal, because it was important that it went through the parliamentary processes to be brought into force.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm somewhat disappointed, though, that the member for Blair couldn't mention the previous government, who actually negotiated and signed the deal. We can be bipartisan here when we know there were certain factual things that happened. Well done to the member for Blair for mentioning the deal. I agree with everything he said about the importance of this deal and everything that was done with this deal. I'm disappointed that he couldn't bring himself to acknowledge the previous government—in fact, the minister at the time, Dan Tehan, who negotiated this deal, signed it before we left government—but what he said was correct: this was an exceptionally important deal for Australia. In fact, I think it's the template for a free trade agreement. The liberalisation we got across a whole range of products was really important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remind the chamber that one of the great achievements of the previous three governments, from 2013 to 22, was in the free trade area. When we came to government in 2013, around 25 per cent of goods and services that we exported were covered by a free trade agreement. By the time we left it was close to 80 per cent, with the last two of those being significant. One of those deals was the deal with the UK and the other one was the preliminary deal with India. Both were really important deals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge what the member for Blair said. He mentioned the EU deal, and I say that the template they need to use for the deal that the current government is trying to negotiate is the UK deal. We will be measuring the achievements of the new government, in this free trade agreement they do with the EU, against what we achieved with the UK. There are some great things there, and with all due respect—I actually have great personal admiration for the current minister for trade—he does have his work cut out because we know there are elements of the Labor Party that do not like free trade agreements, and I say this respectfully; I respect their opinion. The CFMEU are on the record for having criticised the UK deal. They appeared before a parliamentary committee on the deal, when it was going through ratification, and spoke against the deal. So I know the minister has his work cut out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the deal that the current minister is negotiating with the EU, measuring it against the deal we did with the UK, I'll look for some of the products the member previously brought up—the complete liberalisation of sugar, the complete liberalisation of beef and the complete liberalisation of sheep meat. Let's look at those as the starting point. Again, the deal we did with the UK is the template.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I get the sensitivity around all this in the ag sector. The ag sector is very important to us, Deputy Speaker Freelander. To give you some figures on trade, the four biggest trading commodities in our economy—not necessarily large exports to the UK—are coal, gas, iron ore and ag. Those are the four sectors that drive our trading performance. I'm going to use ballpark figures here: ag is a bit under $100 billion, while coal and iron ore, depending on prices, can be well over $100 billion, but let's say the four of them generate about $400 billion of exports in our country. Again, the trade deals that we did from 2013 to 2022 have helped that. We have a lot of investment into export areas. Those four sectors drive a lot of economic activity. When you look at royalties, when you look at company taxes and when you look at the personal income taxes of the people who work in those sectors, we're probably talking over $100 billion from those four sectors alone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous minister for trade has just walked in, the member for Wannon. To the previous minister, I acknowledge you for doing this deal. The member for Blair, who moved this motion, couldn't quite bring himself to do it, but I will. This is the template that we should be using; the deal that the member for Wannon did with the UK is the template that we need to use for the deal that the new government is doing with the EU. You've raised a bar in the deal that you got, and it's a high bar. We look forward to the current government getting the same types of results.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will end here by reiterating the importance of trade and the importance of being a low tariff and low taxing economy. That's what drives this economy. I commend the previous minister for doing this wonderful deal.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="276714" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DAVID SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bean</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:47</span>):  I rise today to also speak in favour of the member for Blair's motion about the Australia-United Kingdom Free Trade Agreement that came into effect earlier this year. I particularly congratulate the member for Blair for his advocacy in this space, and I congratulate all in this parliament who've done important work in this space.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're already seeing significant benefits flowing from the UK free trade agreement. In the first month since the agreement entered into force, the value of Australia's exports to the UK increased by almost 200 per cent from the same time a year earlier. Australian farmers and agricultural exporters of beef, sheep meat and wine are reaping benefits that have not been experienced since the UK joined the European Economic Community, as it was known then, in 1973.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Both sides of the House agree that the UK FTA is a strong free trade agreement. The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties noted earlier this year that the agreement reflected the longstanding importance, quality and depth of the political, cultural and economic relationship between Australia and the United Kingdom, while looking to set a framework for future trade and co-operation. The joint standing committee also stated that the UK FTA would contribute to diversifying Australia's trade, and it addresses traditional free trade agreement concerns while incorporating a wider range of social and economic principles. At the same time, the UK FTA preserves policy and regulatory space for parties in rapidly evolving sectors, such as digital trade and financial services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This deal includes strong commitments on the environment, including climate change and labour. This agreement will preserve the right of the Australian government to regulate in the public interest, including for the environment, education and health. It represents one of the most comprehensive, innovative and ambitious free trade agreements entered into by Australia to date, and strengthens an already close relationship between Australia and the UK. The agreement supports the government's trade diversification strategy, delivering unprecedented benefits to Australian businesses and creating new, well-paying jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to the Australian government implementing Australia's trade agreement with the UK, Australian exports, particularly in the agriculture sector, faced extremely high barriers. But the agreement now also facilitates the two-way flow of professionals and helps to address the skills shortage in Australia by providing an overdue framework for professional bodies to agree to streamlined licensing and qualification processes for qualified professionals. This is something that I used to run into a fair bit when I represented engineers. It provides greater certainty in digital trade rules and facilitates trade for Australian businesses looking to grow their digital footprint in the UK. This agreement underpins and deepens our already strong bilateral investment relationship with the UK, which is the second-largest source of foreign direct investment in Australia—valued at around $138 billion in 2022.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But trade is more than just the exchange of products and services; it also boosts the exchange of ideas. This free trade agreement establishes procedures for artists, including First Nations people, to receive royalties when their artworks are resold in the UK. The Australian government has sought high-quality commitments on key sustainability issues, such as environmental protection and labour rights, that align with internationally agreed principles, standards and rules. We have already prioritised the establishment of strong regulatory practice and compliance provisions that create a more predictable business environment for Australian companies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has tilted the playing field to become level again, allowing innovative and hardworking Australian farmers and businesses to compete fairly in the British market. Importantly, an investor-state dispute settlement mechanism is not part of the agreement. This means that Australia's sovereign right to develop and implement legitimate policy measures in areas such as public health and the environment is preserved. But this agreement creates new opportunities to deepen and expand trade investment with one of Australia's most important and longstanding trading partners. It's consistent with our approach to ease the cost of living in Australia by removing tariffs on UK-made goods, which will see Australians pay less at the shops for imported goods from the United Kingdom.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I again commend the member for Blair for this motion, and the Minister for Trade, Senator Farrell, for his hard work in delivering this free-trade agreement.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="210911" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TEHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:52</span>):  I'll just have to pick up on the previous speaker's conclusion there because this wonderful UK-Australia free trade agreement was negotiated and signed by the previous government! I had the great honour of being Australia's trade minister at that time, and it's why I was very keen to speak on this motion. The member for Blair may or may not be aware that when we were negotiating this free trade agreement I went to the Tate and Lyle Sugar factory, which is on the Thames. In the very early seventies or late sixties, sugar boats used to sail from Australia. They would sail up the Thames and drop the sugar off there. It would then be manufactured by Tate and Lyle into golden syrup and other things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the UK went into the EU that all stopped. One of the things I was very determined to do in negotiating the agreement was to make sure that we got an outcome on sugar. I particularly want to thank Australia's High Commissioner at the time, George Brandis, a Queenslander, who was also very determined to get an outcome on sugar. We were able to get a fantastic outcome on sugar, and my hope is that we will all be able to celebrate when that boat arrives, goes up the Thames and delivers sugar back to Tate and Lyle again. It will be a fantastic outcome for Australia because it will give us diversity in markets; that's what free-trade agreements are all about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The great thing about the Australia-UK Free Trade Agreement is that it's the most comprehensive free trade agreement we've done outside the one we've got with New Zealand, which has closer economic relations and is the global gold standard when it comes to free trade agreements. The Australia-UK Free Trade Agreement is as good as the New Zealand one in almost all aspects but isn't quite as comprehensive. Hopefully, over time we might be able to continue to negotiate to add to it even more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we were able to do in the UK free trade agreement was deliver greater access not only when it comes to sugar but also right across the board: lamb, beef, dairy—you name it. It is the most comprehensive agricultural access that we've got in any agreement since the one we negotiated with New Zealand. One of the great things about a charity run I just did to raise awareness for a disease called CJD—along with 11 other runners, I ran from Canberra to Warrnambool, over 950 kilometres. Along the way, we went through the heartland of rural Australia, including along the Murray, where we bumped into some citrus growers. It was fantastic to hear about the first shipment of oranges that will be going to the UK since the early seventies. Not only have we managed to get sugar back into the UK market; we're also getting citrus back to the UK market as well as our beef, lamb, dairy products and wine. All these things have benefited, and regional and rural Australia, where one in four jobs come as a result of trade, has particularly benefited from this outcome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will draw on some remarks that were made by the shadow minister for trade which I think were important remarks for all of us to remember. Currently the new government is negotiating the Australia-EU free trade agreement. We did 12 rounds of that when we were in government. We were setting it up for a big finish, and now the baton has been passed to the new government to conclude. One of the keys to that agreement is that we have to get access for agricultural producers from that agreement, because you only get one chance in a free trade agreement to get your ag sector looked after. The World Trade Organisation has great difficulties getting an outcome for agriculture, so we have to do it in free trade agreements. We did it in this agreement, and that's why we're here celebrating what we've been able to do on sugar, but, when it comes to the EU agreement, we've got to make sure we can get exactly the same agricultural outcomes.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="300129" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:57</span>):  I'm delighted to rise in support of the motion moved by the member for Blair. I also commend the contribution made earlier by the member for Bean, who I know is a very proud chair of the United Kingdom parliamentary group. This is a motion for which all sides of the chamber can come together to both support and celebrate just as much as both sides of this trade agreement can too. Despite our differences at times, we can certainly come together in support of free, fair and open trade, and I know that this is something the Albanese Labor government both believes in and supports wholeheartedly. This is particularly the case with the Australia-UK Free Trade Agreement. When a deal is this good, how can you be silent?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The process involved with the agreement was one several years in the making. It's seen a change of government on our side. It's seen three prime ministers and three secretaries of state for international trade in the UK. It's proof that our countries' relationship and our commitment to work together towards common goals and mutually beneficial outcomes will stand the test of time beyond slight changes in the headwinds in our respective nations. Whilst the United Kingdom may not presently be our largest trading partner, they are certainly Australia's oldest trading partner. It goes without saying that many things do change somewhat over those long years too, with the United Kingdom turning its gaze more toward its own doorstep, to Europe. As for Australia too, over those years, we diverted our gaze quite intently toward Asia and toward our Pacific neighbours both in respect of trade and also by forging strong bilateral relations within our own corner of the world. However, this has definitely not dimmed the close bonds and friendships shared between our nations—except, perhaps, during the Ashes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1973, when the United Kingdom first joined the European Economic Community, the forebear to the European Union, we experienced sharp decreases in trade, which can largely be attributed to high tariffs and quotas that were particularly punitive to our agricultural exports to the UK. As someone who grew up on his family's farm and now sits on the House's Standing Committee on Agriculture—from farm to table would be an elegant way to put it—I know that many farmers across Australia would be the first to cheer on this trade agreement, given it is one that effectively scraps 99 per cent of tariffs on a giant list of goods that I don't have close to enough time to list.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In tribute to the member for Blair's home state, I'll give an honourable mention to sugar in particular. To those farmers and those involved in this industry, many from Queensland, it is the first time in 50 years that they have tariff-free access to the UK market. Prior to this agreement, sugar had a tariff of 62 per cent placed on it. Is this the sweetest part of agreement? No, not by far, and after a brief interlude to talk about Queensland sugar, my one-track mind will once again proudly turn to my state of South Australia. It is one that is set to benefit greatly from this agreement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whether it be the world-renowned honey produced by Ligurian bees on Kangaroo Island or wines produced across many regions in South Australia and consumed across the globe, viticulture and many other industries will have further and fairer access to a market of 68 million people. Decreasing trade barriers means increasing consumer choice. I know that the things we grow and the things we make here can stand on their merit on the world stage and we will prosper in a market that allows us to compete on a level playing field. Soon we can start seeing less wine from Bordeaux and more from the Barossa being consumed in restaurants, bars and homes across the UK.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I opened in a bipartisan spirit. I intend to close on that same note—a rarity at times, I know. Free trade agreements are, after all, a long process, and I would like to end by acknowledging the tireless work that our trade minister has done in order to bring this deal home. I also acknowledge the former trade ministers for their efforts along the way, particularly the efforts of the initial minister, Senator Birmingham, along with the member for Wannon. I am sure that over the years we will continue to see the benefits amplify, when tariffs and quotas are further reduced and abolished on our exports, seeing both our economies and our peoples enriched as a result. I'm pleased to see Australia become a stronger trade partner with the UK, though it would be difficult to find a closer ally or friend. I thank the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flynn</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:02</span>):  The Flynn electorate is made up of diverse industries that contribute an incredible amount to the Australian economy exporting abroad. Thanks to the coalition, there will be more opportunities for industries in Flynn to expand into the UK market. The UK's trade agreement with Australia was the very first trade agreement that it reached following its exit from the EU. It was signed on 17 December 2021 and came into force on 31 May 2023. It is a highly ambitious agreement, commenced and negotiated by the Liberals and Nationals in government. Farmers and producers will have improved access to more than 65 million UK consumers who value safe, sustainably produced foods and beverages with a strong origin in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a few benefits for the industries in my electorate of Flynn. Roughly half of Australia's cattle population lives in Queensland, and roughly one-third of that is in Central Queensland. For beef, a tariff-free quota of 35,000 tonnes at entry into force will expand to 110,000 tonnes in year 10. Tariffs on beef will be eliminated after 10 years. Bundaberg and the North Burnett's rich red soil, abundant rivers and surrounding seas are the source of never-ending seasonal and varied produce, growing 25 per cent of Australia's fresh food produce. For horticulture, tariffs were eliminated on most fruits and vegetables at EIF, with tariffs on other products of Australian export interest to be eliminated over three years and all remaining tariffs to be eliminated over the next seven years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2021 the sugar industry spent and generated $72 million and employed 520 people in the Flynn electorate, according to the Australian Sugar Milling Council. In my neighbouring seat of Hinkler, over the same period, the sugar industry had a total impact of $615 million and employed over 3,000 people. For sugar, the current tariff-free quota of 80,000 tonnes at entry into force will expand to 220 tonnes by October 2030 and will then be eliminated. According to the Queensland Farmers Federation:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Queensland milks 150,000 cows on approximately 430 farms located throughout southeast Queensland, Darling Downs, Wide Bay, Central Queensland around Monto, Rockhampton, and Eungella, and in Far North Queensland near the Atherton Tableland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For dairy, there will be an elimination of tariffs over five years, with immediate access to duty-free quotas for dairy products during the transition period. According to the Queensland Department of Agriculture, Queensland commercial fisheries have produced an average of approximately 17,000 tonnes of seafood per year since 2015. For seafood, there will be an elimination of tariffs on most products on EIF and remaining tariffs over three years. Tariffs eliminated on EIF include those on all finfish and the 12 per cent tariff on fresh and frozen rock lobster. Chickpeas, sorghum, wheat and mung beans are the most significant commodities produced in the Central Highlands, with barley, corn, peanuts, sunflowers and forage crops also grown. For wheat, barley and other cereals, there will be an elimination of tariffs over four years, immediate access to a duty-free quota of 80,000 tonnes per year for wheat and a duty-free quota of 7,000 tonnes a year for barley.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian households and businesses will save around $200 million a year, with tariffs on almost all UK goods being eliminated on entry into force. Professionals will have the same access to the UK's lucrative jobs market as their European competitors, except from the Republic of Ireland. This means that Australian jobseekers can compete on an equal footing with EU nationals in the UK for the first time in more than 40 years. Young people will have more time to travel the UK for a working holiday and will be able to stay longer, with the age of eligibility to participate in working holiday opportunities raised from 30 to 35 years of age and stays allowed for up to three years in each country. Australian businesses will have a guaranteed right to bid for a greater variety of UK government contracts in a procurement market worth an estimated half a trillion dollars annually. UK businesses will be encouraged to invest in Australia thanks to the best investment practice rules, including to set up regional headquarters in Australia to leverage our network of free trade agreements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Free trade agreement will deliver more for Australian jobs and businesses and opportunities for exporters. Australian producers and farmers will receive a significant boost by getting greater access to the UK market, which is welcome in the electorate of Flynn.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion relates particularly to the $60 billion black hole in the government's energy plan, as exposed by independent analysis from a leading Australian energy economist. It's not the coalition putting this; this is coming from an independent economist. Independent analysis has revealed that more than $60 billion of mega energy projects, which the government is seeking to build by 2030, are unaccounted for in the government's logic, despite their significant impact on the energy prices paid by households. The concerns that are being raised pertain to the Commonwealth's Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation's GenCost study, which evaluates the levelised cost of electricity for different energy-generating technologies. The GenCost study provides a central justification for the government's radical energy experiment and the repeated mantra that renewables are the cheapest form of energy. We hear this over and over again from Minister Bowen. But Australians are not convinced. Australian families paying their energy bills are not convinced. Australian companies and Australian industry are not convinced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The GenCost report fails to account for the true cost of various energy generation technologies by excluding the cost of integrating them into the electricity network. This includes projects such as Snowy 2.0, the Kurri Kurri gas plant, significant integrated system plan transmission projects, Tasmania Battery of the Nation and the Illawarra gas peaking plant. The $60 billion price tag excludes household batteries and the distribution network. This government has wilfully misrepresented the study to blind Australians to the true cost of the government's plan. We need a total system cost assessment for energy, including integration costs, because this will be paid for in the energy bills of Australian households and businesses. Therefore, the government is called upon to immediately stop misrepresenting the price of various energy generation technologies so that a complete assessment can be done to determine the true optimum investment pathway for Australia's energy market. The government must also adopt an 'all of the above' approach to energy, as the opposition has done, which allows for a mix of different technologies to be considered. This includes renewables.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition is supportive of a transformation to net zero technologies, but it can't be done on an ideological basis of refusing to look at any other technologies except for renewable energy. We are now starting to see the exact cost of this government's failed energy policy, including the failure to consider keeping gas until we've got sufficient levels of base load power and the failure also to even consider looking at modern nuclear, which has been embraced by many countries throughout the world and will continue to be. There is no country in the world that has successfully moved to renewables only to power its energy supply. We are now seeing the massive cost to our country through the government's zealotry in only looking at renewable energies. This has been seen, particularly, with a $60 billion blackhole now exposed in the Albanese Labor government's radical energy experiment. The government needs to stop now, have a look at its policy, have a look at its costing and provide the Australian people with some honesty and real costing on this policy.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:13</span>):  A year ago, a little after sunrise on 25 October 2022, the member for Fairfax was happy to stand in this place and try to take credit for the rollout of solar and wind power in Australia, almost all of which, to that date, was supported by state government policies. He then suggested that the Albanese government's targets were too ambitious. Then, of course, he also voted against the climate change bill, and, in December, he voted against the price cap and so voted against lower energy bills for all Australians, just as other members of the opposition did. It is beyond bewildering that anyone has bothered to show up to debate this motion—although it can't be said for the member for Fairfax, who is not here to debate his own motion, with the member for Hughes standing there on shaky ground trying to take his place. I hope my speaking on this odd coalition motion doesn't lend any semblance of credibility to it, but I feel obliged to do so as a member of the government committed to tackling carbon emissions and the massive task of transitioning away from reliance on fossil fuels and towards cheap and reliable renewable sources of energy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After a decade on the Treasury benches, the coalition have amassed a string of best hits in relation to energy policy. In the wake of Prime Minister Tony Abbott tearing up the most effective carbon abatement policy this country has had to date, we had direct action followed by, 'This is coal,' when under Turnbull's prime ministership the soon-to-be next prime minister and now member for Cook implored us not to be scared of a lump of coal. That is the coalition, always wishing it was the mid-20th century. We then saw a rejection of the clean energy target and the introduction of the National Energy Guarantee followed by the scrapping of the renewable energy targets. Then those opposite went all Soviet on us and threatened to use taxpayer dollars to build a coal-fired power plant. We were assured we would make our Paris targets in a canter. Then we saw huge investments in hydro and batteries, but that made a few of those opposite uncomfortable so we then got the gas-led recovery. Over the last decade the coalition have presided over four gigawatts of dispatchable energy, leaving the national energy market with only one gigawatt coming back in. Now they pretend to form policy while only flirting with the nuclear industry. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like most areas of policy and government this means Australia has a lot of catching up to do, but that catching up has begun under the Albanese Labor government and will continue. In the less than 18 months of Albanese government we have already provided business and investors with the certainty that they crave by legislating emission reduction targets and setting new renewable energy targets. We have capped gas prices to keep electricity prices from spiralling out of control after the coalition kept Australians in the dark in relation to how bad the energy crisis was in the dying days of their government. We have put in place proper incentives for industry to reduce their emissions output through the legislated safeguards mechanism. We have reinvigorated ARENA and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. We're investing in hydrogen, solar, on and offshore wind, transmission and the training required to ensure skilled workers are there to keep the lights on for all of us. Australia under Prime Minister Albanese, Minister Bowen and Minister Plibersek is once more being taken seriously on the international stage. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The GenCost report by the CSIRO and AEMO does include the cost of transmission and storage for renewables. It is not uncommon for the coalition to undervalue the CSIRO. Some members opposite may well find it confronting to learn that governments and legislators are always obliged to accept and act on the best scientific advice available. In relation to nuclear energy, the member for Fairfax appears to favour that the GenCost report indicates the nuclear path would be five times more expensive than renewables. The SMRs also promise to be dirtier, creating more nuclear waste. Feasibility is a live issue, and the time frame within which such reactors might be able to be constructed means they would only start to provide energy next decade, by which time the march of renewables will be so progressed as to make the coalition's nuclear thought bubble more farcical than it is now. The sun will rise in the morning, and it's not a metaphor. The sun will rise each and every day in this country, and each and every day it will shine on more solar panels and push wind through more turbines than it did the day before. The member for Fairfax and the opposition need to catch up. The world is turning without them. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PEARCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:18</span>):  Prime Minister Albanese made several promises in the lead-up to the last election. One of course  was the infamous promise to reduce household power bills by $275 during their first term. Fast-forward 18 months and today we are a country in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis. Instead of power prices going down, families are paying some of the highest prices in the developed world. Small businesses are being asked to do more with less and brought to their knees by the cost of energy. Eighteen months on and Labor's promise of cheaper power bills is in tatters, but on this side we have always known that this was an empty promise because misrepresentation and deception were at the very heart of this promise. Labor has always maintained that a balance of technologies isn't needed because renewables alone will deliver the cheapest energy for Australian businesses and households. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this position by the minister and by the government is founded principally on one document: the CSIRO's GenCost report. This report evaluates the levelled cost of electricity for different energy-generating technologies. An independent analysis has exposed significant flaws in the way Labor is representing its claim to Australians. This is not what some may call a 'slip of the pen' error. Labor has deliberately excluded $60 billion of integration costs from its renewable energy calculations. This includes in excess of 10,000 kilometres of transmission lines that will be required; 15 gigawatts of storage capacity; Snowy Hydro 2.0; and Tasmania's Battery of the Nation project. Tasmania, of course, has less than one per cent of Australia's land mass. However, we receive 9½ per cent of Australia's rainfall and we have 26½ per cent of Australia's fresh water in storage across 54 hydro dams. That's 54 hydro dams turning 30 power stations, some of which are more than 100 years old. These 30 power stations are producing around 9,000 gigawatt hours of clean electricity from hydro power created in Tasmania. That's enough to power 900,000 Australian homes and small businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side, we firmly believe that in order to achieve our net zero target an all-of-the-above approach is needed—in fact, it is absolutely mandatory—where a mix of technologies is investigated rather than Labor's single-minded, ideological solution. We are led by economics on this side, and by engineering and science—not by bubbles and deception. I therefore call on this minister to reveal the true cost of Labor's energy transition plan and to admit to Australians—to look down the camera and tell them—that this can only be the result if every single household and business pays more for their electricity.</span>

                  </a>  Actually, it applies to just about every policy! We know that the coalition's nuclear ideology is founded on fantasies from the past and fuelled by the suspicion of sunlight and wind, the cheapest, cleanest and most abundant forms of energy that our continent has. They want to fill their black hole with nuclear power stations. In 2007, during the dying days of the Howard government, the coalition were falling apart on the issue of nuclear power. The Liberals were flirting with the idea of building nuclear power stations, while members of the National Party—remember those guys that used to be connected with farmers before they were taken over by economists, bankers and journalists?—were calling on the Liberals not to build nuclear power stations in Australia. At the time, the Howard government couldn't tell Australians where these plants would be located or where the nuclear waste would be stored. Without that detail, Australians felt insecure and worried about whether a nuclear plant or waste storage would be plonked in their suburb. It's now 2023 and the coalition's current claim is that nuclear energy is the lowest form of low carbon. Where is this fantasy coming from? I was just up in the Federation Chamber, where I heard two speakers talk about energy. There was no mention of nuclear until right at the end.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that nuclear is around three times more expensive than firm renewables. New analysis by the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water shows that Australians will be lumped with a $387 billion cost burden if nuclear power is used to replace our current fleet of coal-fired power stations. The member for Dickson and his climate-denying coalition colleagues like to talk up their record on the economy, but this figure, $387 billion, is proof that their nuclear energy plan flies in the face of economics and reason. The coalition's $387 billion plan is 20 times the cost of the government's Rewiring the Nation Fund. Through already agreed state deals, it will support unlocking over 26 gigawatts of new renewable generation capacity and over 30 gigawatts of transmission capacity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">World nuclear industry status report</span> tells us that nuclear costs rose 36 per cent between 2009 and 2021, whilst solar costs fell 90 per cent and wind fell by 72 per cent. So I'd like to hear the explanation by those opposite of why they want to hit Australians with a $387 billion cost burden for a nuclear energy plan that flies in the face of economics and reason. The fact is that power generated from solar and wind is cheaper, cleaner and puts downward pressure on electricity bills. And, of course, nuclear is slow to build. If we went down the track proposed by those opposite, it would take decades before they could even flick on a single light bulb. And what would we do in the meantime? Nothing, probably—as, when it comes to dealing with climate and energy, the opposition have proved themselves to be masters of nothingness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nuclear energy is not flexible to use. You can't turn a nuclear plant on and off easily. They're even worse than the boilers in a coal-fired power station. So they're very ineffective when it comes to peaking on that superhot day in Queensland, on that cold day in Melbourne or at half-time at the State of Origin game, when there's a great demand for electricity. We need storage batteries, pumped solar et cetera to ramp up and down as needs vary. The opposition have shared no plan or detail on where these nuclear plants would be built. I remember that—</span>

                  </a>  Mr Speaker, the evil committed by Hamas in Israel has chilled every Australian heart. We have all been profoundly shocked by the scale and wantonness of these attacks. What has happened affects both Israelis and Palestinians, so it's important to note that this motion deals with the situation that both now confront. And I will speak to both. We must face what has happened and what is now unfolding with complete moral clarity. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hamas terrorists committed mass murder on a horrific scale. Jewish families here and across the world are mourning the greatest loss of Jewish life in a single day since the Holocaust. This was no act of war against the army of an enemy. It was the slaughter of innocent people. It was an act of terror—calculated, pitiless, brutality—compounded by a rain of rockets designed to kill and to terrify without mercy and without discrimination. We have learned of acts of violation and humiliation so grotesque they should be beyond imagination but have been made reality by Hamas. They targeted young people at a music festival and hunted them down. They preyed on families, on children, on parents trying to protect their babies in what often proved to be their desperate final act. And Hamas celebrated. They wanted the world to see. They rejoiced in suffering and death. It is so difficult to contemplate. It is so confronting. But we cannot turn away from the truth. We must call these atrocities for what they are. We must condemn them together, and today this motion does just that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As hard as it is for any of us to bear, we know that it is hardest on Australia's Jewish community. Australia has the largest per capita Holocaust survivor population outside Israel. Our Jewish Australian community is made up of Holocaust survivors, their children and grandchildren. The branches of their family trees are heavy with loss and suffering, with acts of survival in the face of overwhelming odds. It is nearly 80 years since that darkest of chapters closed, nearly eight decades of the world saying: never again. It is shocking and wrong that in 2023 Jewish people are having to draw on their courage and resilience again, enduring such loss, enduring the weight of not knowing and, for those with relatives who are missing, enduring the weight of hope. I want to repeat the message that I've given to all Jewish Australians since the outset: you are not alone; your fellow Australians stand with you.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was not just an attack on Israel. This was an attack on Jewish people. Let us be clear: Hamas is an enemy, but not just of Israel. Hamas is an enemy of all peace-loving Palestinian people who are left to pay a devastating price for this terrorism. Hamas honours no faith. It serves no cause but terror. It is no better than any other group in history that has clung to the twisted belief that victory can be built on the blood of the innocent. In the words of President Joe Biden:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Hamas does not stand for the Palestinian people's right to dignity and self-determination. Its stated purpose is the annihilation of the State of Israel and the murder of Jewish people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">They use Palestinian civilians as human shields. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Hamas offers nothing but terror and bloodshed with no regard to who pays the price.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should be very clear that it is Hamas that is the enemy, not the Palestinian people. The Palestinian people are suffering greatly, and this suffering has impacted on generations of Palestinians. The humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, which is home to two million people, is deteriorating rapidly. We are monitoring the situation closely and we support the work of the United Nations, the United States, Israel and Egypt to establish safe passage for Gaza civilians. There is no question that Israel has the right to defend itself against a terrorist organisation and to take strong action against it, but we join the calls of President Biden and other partners for Israel to operate by the rules of war.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As French President Emmanuel Macron has said, preserving civilian populations is the duty of democracies. Protecting innocent people is not a show of weakness; it is a measure of strength because true strength never turns its back on humanity. We care about the lives of everyone caught in this conflict—that is who we are as Australians. We believe all people have the right to live in peace within secure borders. The people of Israel have that right, the people of Palestine have that right and the best path to that reality is a negotiated two-state solution within internationally recognised borders. As Foreign Minister Penny Wong told the Australia-Israel Chamber of Commerce last week, one of the many tragic consequences of Hamas's abhorrent attack is that it's pushed that two-state solution further out of reach, and that also makes this an unconscionable crime perpetrated by Hamas against the Palestinian people.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Amidst this depravity, we can never let go of our own humanity because there is no greater weapon against inhumanity. As Ministers Wong and Conroy announced on Saturday, Australia is providing an initial $10 million in humanitarian assistance for civilians affected by the conflict in Gaza. We will provide $3 million to the International Committee of the Red Cross to fund urgent needs, like restoring essential services and providing medical support to victims of the conflict. Through United Nations agencies, we will provide $7 million to deliver critical support, including emergency water, nutrition, sanitation and hygiene services, as well as child protection. We will continue to monitor and assess the humanitarian situation and stand ready to provide further support.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are moving quickly in pursuing all options to get out Australians who want to leave Israel or the occupied Palestinian territories. The first Australian government assisted departure flight landed in London on Saturday morning, with 238 Australians and their family members on board. I know we are all relieved those Australians are on their way home, and I thank the Australian officials who helped assist. We thank Qantas for the support it provided. Overnight we provided a further three flights: two operated by the ADF, and one government charter. But the situation on the ground is challenging and rapidly deteriorating. For Australians who want to leave, I can't emphasise this enough: I strongly encourage you to take the first option you can. Please do not wait for another option. We have secured flights for onward travel to Australia from London and Dubai. Information about those flights will be provided directly to passengers, and further details will be released soon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are assessing the situation very closely and working as fast as possible to help Australians. We know not everyone can get to the airport and that the security situation is very dangerous in some areas. We're supporting Australians who have registered with DFAT's consular emergency centre and are updating them with all the details directly. DFAT's crisis centre in Canberra is operating on a 24-hour basis. Officials from DFAT and other agencies have been deployed to the region, including Tel Aviv, to support assisted departures. If they have not done so already, Australians in Israel or the occupied Palestinian territories who want to leave and don't already have plans to depart should register via DFAT's crisis portal.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just as Hamas stands in the way of a peaceful future for Israelis and Palestinians alike, they try to drive division in every peace-loving democratic society and they seek to fan the embers of antisemitism. We cannot allow that. We will not allow that. I know I speak for every member of this House when I say that this kind of hateful prejudice has no place in Australia. The awful antisemitism chanted by some of the protesters at the Sydney Opera House is beyond offensive; it is a betrayal of our Australian values. We reject it and we condemn it. Our country is better than that and our country is a better place because of our Jewish community. Our government is committed to keeping the community safe.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just as we join in this place to condemn Hamas, the message we should be sending loudly and clearly from this place to all Australians is to avoid the traps set by such forces of division. Anyone seeking to exploit people's suffering for political purposes should consider the damage they risk doing. Anyone tempted by the lazy but corrosive option of false equivalence should shun that temptation. This is a time for compassion, not cynicism. Something that very much bears repeating is the advice of Mike Burgess, the Director-General of ASIO:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… it is important that all parties consider the implications for social cohesion when making public statements. As I have said previously, words matter. ASIO has seen direct connections between inflamed language and inflamed community tensions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Small">As always, ASIO is not interested in those who are engaged in lawful protest, but rather the small subset of protesters who may wish to escalate protest to violence. This includes religiously motivated and ideologically motivated extremists, or anyone who believes that violence is a means to further their own interests.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have no room for antisemitism in this nation just as we have no room for Islamophobia. We have no room for hatred—not against Jews, not against Muslims. Our nation has been made better by generations of both. An important part of our strength as a nation is the breadth of our society, and it is such a great and vibrant strength, but, even in a country as stable and open as ours, social cohesion cannot be taken for granted. It must be nourished and protected. My government is committed to preventing discrimination against people of faith, including through anti-vilification protections. We have established a new, $40 million grants program to improve safety and security at places of worship, religious schools and community groups. I can announce that today the cabinet has agreed to $10 million from the confiscated assets program to be added to that $40 million and to fast-track the processing of what were many hundreds of applications just this week. We expect to have an announcement of funding in days.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In June the government introduced the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Prohibited Hate Symbols and Other Measures) Bill to criminalise public displays of hate symbols. In addition to the important measures that seek to protect the community from symbols of hate, the bill will ensure that glorifying and praising acts of terrorism are criminal offences under Commonwealth law. The bill will also increase the penalties for those seeking to glorify these atrocities.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is continuing to implement a strengths based approach to build on the successes of Australia's cohesive and inclusive multicultural society. Those successes are considerable. As Australians, we should all take pride in what we have built together as an open-hearted, welcoming country driven by compassion and an instinctive sense of fairness. We showed it in 1948, when Australia played a role in the foundation of the modern state of Israel. It was a moment of light after the darkness of the Holocaust.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the House another source of pride is the fact that it was a Labor minister and future Labor leader, Doc Evatt, who was there at the heart of it all at the United Nations as President of the General Assembly. With Evatt presiding over the UN and supported by Prime Minister Chifley, Australia was the first country to vote for Israel to be made a member.</span>

I commend the motion to the House.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DUTTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dickson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:47</span>):  I want to thank the Prime Minister for his words and for discussions that we've been involved in this morning in relation to the substance of the motion. It's remarkable that this attack on 7 October was just a total act of sheer barbarity. The images, the shocking betrayal and the interpretation of what took place mean that no longer can the sympathisers of these murderous terrorists call them freedom fighters. No longer can the apologists of this death cult claim they have a just and noble cause. What occurred nine days ago was the embodiment of evil, and the abhorrent acts of Hamas's inhumanity have been evident for the world to see: missiles raining down on Israeli cities; militants invading Israeli territory; a massacre of young people at a music festival; civilians gunned down in their cars, fired upon while fleeing and executed in the streets after surrendering; women being raped and being stripped naked, dragged and displayed through the streets; lifeless and mutilated bodies being paraded on the backs of utilities; mothers and fathers riddled with bullets as they used their bodies to cover their children in a final act of bravery; jihadists cheering over the dead bodies of Israeli soldiers; babies being beheaded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We pray for all of those innocent people who have been abducted and are currently being held as hostages, having been taken to Gaza, especially the elderly and the children. The monsters of Hamas will continue to use them as human shields. We saw images over the weekend of a Hamas militant nursing toddlers who had been abducted from Israel. If we needed any more convincing of Hamas's unashamed sadism, it's the glee that they have displayed in stating that they will film and post online the execution of those little boys and girls, those men and women, those survivors of the Holocaust.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that more than 1,000 Israelis are dead and thousands more are wounded. As others have observed, 7 October was Israel's September 11. It was, with great shame, the greatest loss of Jewish life on a single day since the end of the Holocaust. It was the most major attack on Israel since the Yom Kippur War of 1973. Let us be under no misapprehension about the nature of the attack: like Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Hamas's invasion of Israel was unprovoked, it was unjust and it was absolutely unacceptable. And let us be under no misapprehension about Hamas's intent from this point: it has no desire for a peaceful two-state solution. Its actions were designed to derail the peace process. Hamas wants to remove Israel from the map and drive people of Jewish faith into the sea.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition joins with every other person of decent humanity in condemning this attack by Hamas militants on Israel. Israel has every right to exist. Israel has every right to defend itself and its people. Israel has every right to deter future attacks and other acts of aggression, of coercion and of interference. The coalition supports, and proudly supports, Israel's right to do what is necessary and needed in the circumstances, with every asset available to safeguard its sovereignty, to bolster its borders, to protect its people and to thwart the threats it now faces—the existential threats. There must be no restraint shown to those who have shown no restraint themselves in committing these vicious and vile acts of terrorism.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the honour of speaking the other day to the Australian resident ambassador of Israel, His Excellency Amir Maimon. I say to him and to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and to the people of Israel in their darkest hours: the coalition wishes you swift success in a war you did not choose but a war which you are compelled to fight.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The events unfolding abroad are disturbing for the many Australians who have close ties to Israel and Palestine. Some Australians will have family and friends caught up on both sides of this horrible conflict. Let me make this important point: events abroad must be no justification for rising tensions within our own communities. It's particularly repugnant that some Australians have decided to take to the streets to celebrate Hamas's attack on Israel and the slaughter of innocent Israeli children, women and men. We heard an odious barrage of comments on the attacks, describing them—in our country!—as a day of pride and a day of victory. Moreover, the rally which occurred on the evening of Monday 9 October at the Sydney Opera House was an abomination and a day of shame for our nation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's Jewish community were unable to gather at our iconic landmark, which, to the credit of the NSW government, had been illuminated in blue and white as a sign of support. They wanted to be there to mourn loved ones who have been lost and to express their solidarity. The anti-Israel protesters fired flares, burnt an Israeli flag and shouted words that we should never here in our country or anywhere else in the civilised world, including 'Gas the Jews', 'F the Jews' and 'F Israel.' That was the depth of the sentiment, and that is the reason we gather here today to condemn those comments. Such behaviour—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr DUTTON:</span>
                  </a>  I won't stop saying it. I'll take the interjection. I won't stop saying it, because it should be condemned. The words should never have been said in the first place. Shame on you for condoning those words or suggesting that those words shouldn't be condemned in this place. I won't stop saying them, and the Jewish community here in Australia deserves to hear you condemn them as well. That behaviour is a stain on the Australian character and a flagrant disregard of human decency. The Australians who watched the footage of those seething mobs and their sordid behaviour did not recognise their fellow countrymen.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I joined with great pride 10,000 Australians at Dover Heights last Wednesday for a Jewish community vigil. The pain of events abroad was palpable as you looked at the audience of people of Jewish faith, people of other faiths, people of no faith, there to provide support to Australians. It was raw, the tears from young girls, from grandmothers, striking. But, most concerning, those Australians of Jewish faith were gathered, and I could see the anxiety in their eyes. I could see that they were frightened. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is not without its antisemitic elements. Both sides of politics have fought back against it, as we have every other form of politically motivated violence. But the rally at the Sydney Opera House escalated that antisemitism to another level. We have to recognise that because the impact it has had on the Jewish community here in Australia will take a lot to undo. We need to understand that level of anxiety in the Jewish community at present. Jewish parents are concerned about their children wearing their Jewish school uniform in public. In our country Jewish people are apprehensive about their safety when visiting a Jewish supermarket or practising their faith at a synagogue, not because of something they've done or said but because of who they are, because of their faith, because of their heritage, because of their belief. That's the reason they are worried about their children being targeted in indiscriminate attacks, that they might be identified by their school uniform that they wear. That is the sentiment running deep within the Jewish community here in our country today. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of this statement on this motion before the House is to recognise those dreadful attacks and the impact they're having psychologically on people in our country. Our wonderful Jewish community needs to know that their security is being taken seriously, both at a federal level and at state levels. I support in the strongest possible terms the Prime Minister's announcement during the course of his remarks today of funding to provide support, particularly to the Jewish community, to bolster security, to make sure that those children can go to school safely and that people in places of gathering can do so with safety first and foremost, and the sanctity of their activities is preserved. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Australians are passionate about the events abroad because of their past, because of their history, because of existing ties to the Middle East, and we respect every view. But we're Australians first and foremost, and the reason for the success of Australia's social cohesion is our social contract as Australians. Under that social contract we do not allow the problems of other parts of the world to manifest in our communities. We keep resentment and anger at bay through the self-command of our character. Many protesters in recent days have undermined our social contract. I encourage faith and multicultural leaders in Australia to call for calm and especially to condemn any abuse or acts which are an incitement to violence, and many of them, to their great credit, have done exactly that. Some leaders, though, have chosen to remain silent, instead of voicing their disapproval, and their silence is, frankly, contemptible. To any Australian who incites or chooses violence, know that you will face the full force of the law. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me reiterate the sentiments I made last week without any hesitation or reservation: people who are non-citizens here in our country on visas and who engaged in vile antisemitic behaviour, who are inciting violence or who choose violence, should have their visas cancelled and be properly deported from our country. Had those comments been made abroad, it is clear that a decision-maker within the Department of Home Affairs would not have granted a visa to come to our country in the first place. Why would there be contention about cancelling a visa of a non-citizen conducting themselves in making public commentary about antisemitic conduct or behaviour or inciting violence or choosing violence? There should be no doubt about the swift course of action required, and I encourage the Minister for Home Affairs to not hesitate in exercising her powers as needed in our national interest. If we are to maintain the social cohesion for which we are known, then we must have zero tolerance of behaviours which are frankly intolerable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With Israel undertaking military operations in Gaza in response to Hamas's acts of terrorism, there have been and will continue to be civilian casualties, tragically, on the Palestinian side, and Hamas know that. They knew that there would be retaliation for these grotesque acts of terrorism. They knew that the Israelis would respond and they knew, through their actions, that it would result directly in the loss of the lives of people on the Gaza Strip and elsewhere. Hamas's tactic of using civilian infrastructure as military headquarters, as storage facilities for weapons and as part of battlefield operations speaks to who they are. If we're looking for an equivalence to Hamas, to their culture and to their conduct, we should look no further than ISIS. This parliament's joined together over a long period of time and we've committed troops to parts of the world, including Afghanistan, to fight back against the depravity of ISIS, their treatment of women and young girls and the way in which they have slaughtered people without a single hesitation. Hamas is the equivalence of ISIS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Israel, of course, is doing its utmost to forewarn civilians and minimise casualties. As the Prime Minister wisely said before, Australians who are in the region should depart if that's appropriate for them in the circumstances. Take the offer if you've asked for it and it's available to you. The situation will clearly deteriorate further. We know that there are some commentators who continue to try and find moral equivalence in the actions of the Israel Defence Forces and Hamas's terrorism. It should be utterly condemned. Australia stood with Ukraine when it was subjected to the barbarity of an invader. Let us today, as a parliament, demonstrate that Australia stands with our longstanding ally, our dedicated partner and our dear friend Israel in the fight against terrorism and in its hour of need. Let us show the Israeli people and Jewish communities here in Australia that they have our support and our solidarity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Seventy-five years ago, the nation of Israel was born. The Jewish people finally had a place which was theirs. The Jewish story, as we know, is one of every trial and tribulation—of privation, of enslavement, of wandering, of subjugation, persecution and exile, of dispersion, of massacre, of Holocaust, the gassing of six million people. But, most importantly, the Jewish story today is one of survival, and it always will be. It's a story of achievement against adversity and of triumph from tragedy. It's a story which is committed to the collective Jewish memory. It is the Jewish memory of prevailing over tragedy and that Jewish spirit we know so well in many of our friends and fellow Australians which will see Israel again succeed through these darkest of days.</span>

We've stood in this place and we've condemned the terrorist attacks in France, in Germany and elsewhere, and we do that again today.</span>

                  <a href="HWQ" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MARLES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corio</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:04</span>):  The last nine days have borne witness to the most desperately sad tragedy—a tragedy for Jews, a tragedy for Muslims, a tragedy for Israel and a tragedy for Palestinians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The unfolding disaster has been a matter of precise calculation by Hamas. Hamas stands in absolute condemnation. The very nature of terrorism is shocking. It invades normality—such as simply attending to a knock on the front door, leaving your kids at child care or going to a music festival, just as thousands of young people—my kids—do in Australia all the time to have fun, to dance, to enjoy youth. In fact the motivation for those who went to the Supernova festival the weekend before last, to experience friendship and joy and community, could not be further removed from what they then encountered in the face of Hamas: evil, extreme violence and death.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Against the backdrop of the anticipated normal, the reality was so shocking that it robbed everyone, no matter what they are doing, of the ability to feel safe. Of course that is the point. These were innocents, they were not combatants and their deaths are murder. So today we stand with Israel and its people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Israel is a Liberal democracy. The values of human rights and freedom of speech form the founding ethos of this country. In that, Israel and Australia are alike. But our connection with Israel runs much deeper than that. It was an Australian foreign minister who chaired—who drove—the UN Special Committee on Palestine in 1947 which gave rise to the very creation of Israel. Doc Evatt regarded this as his signature achievement in public life. He was inspired and supported by the Australian Jewish community of the time. Subsequent to these events his role was acknowledged in the naming of the Doc Evatt Room at the National Library of Israel in Jerusalem this week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What this says is that, from the very beginning of Israel's remarkable journey, Australia was there. This history makes all the more significant the statements of solidarity that we make now in respect of Israel. At the heart of the relationship between Australia and Israel is the Australian Jewish community. Over the course of the last nine days that community—the 10,000 Australians who call Israel home—has been filled with a sense of deep anxiety about the safety and welfare of their family and their friends. We are with them in hoping that those people are alright. We weep for the more than 1,400 innocent Israelis who have lost their lives. Our thoughts are with the thousands who have been injured, and we fervently pray for those who now find themselves in the unspeakable position of being held hostage by Hamas in Gaza.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we also weep for innocent Palestinians. There are more than two million Palestinians who live in Gaza, and the vast bulk of them have absolutely nothing to do with Hamas. They have been born into a life of trying to fashion a version of happiness, of joy, of hope and aspirations for their children—all compromised by being caught in an enduring conflict which is measured in decades. Hamas does not speak for these people. Hamas has completely undermined the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people. Now we are watching Palestinians, in their innocence, die in significant numbers, and we are holding our breath and watching how the coming days and weeks will unfold. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For all of this, we condemn Hamas in the strongest possible terms. Hamas has an ideology of terror, and its acts over the course of the last nine days have been of the most profound evil. Israelis and Palestinians have a right to exist in peace and security. Israel has a right to act in its defence. It has a right to seek the protection and indeed the liberation of its citizens and it has a right to move against Hamas. In that Australia stands with Israel. In the same breath, we add our voice to the international call that the rules of war be respected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The events in the Middle East are reverberating around the world. They are also reverberating here in Australia. At this moment, it is essential that we are vigilant about the cohesion of our own society. We understand that there is a context in the Middle East. We understand that, over a long period of time, these issues have been complex and that there are people in our country who hold passionate views about them. But there was no excuse for the scenes and the chants that we heard outside the Sydney Opera House last Monday. That was nothing other than ugly antisemitism, and it completely diminishes any attempt to advocate on the part of the innocent. There is no place in this country today for antisemitism, and there is no place for Islamophobia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this moment it is absolutely essential that, as we walk the path forward, we do so with respect for each other as Australians. In doing so, we can find illumination from the Islamic faith itself. When Muslims refer to the prophet Mohammed, they attach a phrase 'Peace be upon him'. They do this to accord the highest respect to the prophet by attaching his name to the word 'peace'. In 2:208 of the holy Koran the prophet Mohammed says, 'Enter absolutely into peace'. Indeed the very word 'Islam' is derived from the word 'peace' in Arabic. Peace is at the heart of Islamic theology, as it is at the heart of Judaism and Christianity. As we watch this misery unfold from afar, peace must be the bedrock of our actions here, and, as we walk the road ahead, peace must be our guiding star.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Nationals</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:13</span>):  On behalf of the Nationals, I stand here united with the government on their important motion. Nine days ago Hamas terrorists unleashed a savage, barbaric, murderous assault on Israel. It was an assault that targeted civilians. It was an assault that has left a scene of unimaginable horror and devastation. It was an assault on the world's only Jewish nation. It was an assault which, in all its twisted and evil depravity, was designed to scar and to traumatise. The scenes were sickening—hundreds of young revellers gunned down in a hailstorm of bullets at a music concert; Israeli children and babies slaughtered, some decapitated, in their beds and cots; grandmothers murdered in their gardens; entire families massacred. It was an attack that left 1,400 Israelis dead, murdered in cold blood by a terrorist movement that is renowned for its violent extremism and poisonous and antisemitic ideology. Compounding this sheer horror was the sight of more than 150 civilians who were taken hostage, kidnapped and taken into the Gaza Strip. Through its repugnant beliefs and appalling violence, Hamas presents an existential threat to the state of Israel. Their attack on Israel was a deliberate provocation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The nightmare unfolded in the early morning of last Saturday as Israelis were wrapping up the seven-day-long Jewish festival of Sukkot. Under the cover of a barrage of more than 2,200 rockets fired indiscriminately at Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, hundreds of Hamas terrorists rampaged into southern Israel. They marched into communities and into kibbutz after kibbutz, opening fire on homes and killing women, children, the elderly and any Israeli they came across. Innocent people were slaughtered in the most atrocious of circumstances imaginable. At the Nova music festival, 260 young people were shot as they fled for their lives. At the Be'eri kibbutz, a small Jewish community, more than 100 residents were killed in their homes, including scores of children. Tragically, it was here that we also lost 66-year-old Gilat Carbone, an Australian grandmother. So the federal National Party condemns in the strongest possible terms this abhorrent terrorist attack by Hamas. Our party stands in unity and in solidarity with the nation of Israel and its people. We always have and we always will.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must be clear: Israel has every right to defend itself against the appalling threats presented by an ISIS-like organisation like Hamas, which has no regard at all for human life. We know that the recovery and healing process will be long and traumatic for the families who have lost loved ones and the Jewish communities that were destroyed. Shamefully, this atrocity was the biggest mass murder of Jewish civilians since the Holocaust. Savagery of this magnitude must be confronted. As political leaders, all of us in this place must stand on the side of humanity over evil. The National Party is proud to stand with Israel in their battle against terrorism, and once again we extend our sincere sympathies and condolences to our close friend and ally and its people during this difficult time.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Attorney-General and Cabinet Secretary</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:17</span>):  Today we mourn the greatest loss of Jewish life in a single day since the Holocaust. Today we mourn more than 1,300 people who have been murdered by Hamas terrorists: hundreds of young Israelis, mercilessly hunted down at a music festival; Israelis murdered in their homes, shot as they answered their front doors; Israelis butchered in their beds; entire families slaughtered in their cars, their kitchens and their living rooms; men, women and children; Jewish men, Jewish women and Jewish children. I am the son of a Holocaust survivor who, as a young boy, was forced to flee his home in 1939 and travel to the other side of the world. His life was at risk because—and only because—he is Jewish. My father and my grandparents escaped. More than six million Jewish men, women and children did not escape. They were murdered by the Nazis and their allies and collaborators for being Jewish.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Antisemitism has been called 'the longest hatred'. The Nazis did not invent it. As the events of the last week have demonstrated all too tragically, antisemitism did not end when the Nazis were defeated. Make no mistake: this was not just an attack on the State of Israel and on the people of Israel. This was an attack on the Jewish people. Over thousands of years, the Jewish community—my community—has survived only because of our unbreakable spirit in the face of horrific prejudice. On many occasions, we have had to face that prejudice alone, but not this time, because this time, unlike so many times in our past, the Jewish community is not alone. As this motion makes clear, Israel is not alone. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's support for Israel is deep and enduring. It is a bond of true friendship which goes back to the founding of modern Israel, when Doc Evatt helped to introduce UN resolution 181, and to when, under Prime Minister Ben Chifley, Australia was the first country to cast a vote in favour of creating the modern state of Israel. In the shadow of the Holocaust, Australia supported the legitimate right and aspiration of the Jewish people to establish a Jewish homeland. Australia unambiguously supports the right of Israel to defend itself today. At the same time the Australian government will continue to support the legitimate rights and aspirations of the Palestinian people. To that end it is the policy of this government, as it has been for Australian governments for many years now, to support a just and enduring two-state solution in which Israel and a future Palestinian state coexist in peace and security within internationally recognised borders. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an aspiration shared by many Israelis and by many Palestinian. But let's be clear about something: Hamas does not share this aspiration; Hamas has never shared this aspiration. Hamas has always worked to undermine those who strive for peace, whether they be Israeli or Palestinian, because Hamas has no interest in making peace with Israel. As the founding charter of Hamas declares, its aim is to obliterate Israel. Today, more than 75 years since Australia supported the creation of the modern state of Israel, my message is simple: the Australian government stands as one with Israel and the people of Israel against Hamas and its supporters. Australia stands as one with the Jewish community, and we always will. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:21</span>):  There is no place for antisemitism  in Australia or in this parliament. I think I speak on behalf of everyone in saying that the vile antisemitic comments that we have heard from some in the community and also the attacks of Hamas on innocent civilians which constitute war crimes are to be condemned. It is also contemptible to hear an attempt in this chamber early today from the Leader of the Opposition to try and weaponise it by suggesting that somehow someone in the government condoned any of those remarks. That is beneath contempt. It is beneath contempt on what should be a motion that is about expressing support for people who are on the receiving end of hate, and there is no place for antisemitism  and no place for Islamophobia in this country. We can have a debate in this place about the looming invasion and the need to fight for peace without the Leader of the Opposition falsely accusing people I might have a difference of opinion with, but I can bet my bottom dollar none of them back the vile antisemitic comments that we have heard. It is beneath contempt for the Leader of the Opposition to try and use this motion to prosecute that agenda. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were some other people who gathered over the weekend in their thousands across the country to say that not only is there no place for antisemitism in Australia but there is no place for Islamophobia and that the war on Gaza must stop. Thousands of people gathered together peacefully across the country to make the point that we are on the verge of a humanitarian disaster becoming a humanitarian catastrophe. With a ground invasion of Gaza looming, it is disappointing to say the least that this motion moved by the government backs that invasion. There is much to be supported in this motion. The Greens join in condemning the attacks on innocent civilians and call for the hostages to be freed and for the perpetrators of these war crimes to be held to account. We join with everyone in this place and say there is no place for antisemitism  and Islamophobia. There is much that we could support, but, on the eve of a looming invasion that is likely to be not just a humanitarian catastrophe but a war crime, Australia cannot stay silent and back that invasion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are about 2.3 million people in Gaza crammed into an area about half the size of the ACT. In many respects, Gaza is a walled-in primary school, with 40 per cent of the population under 15 years old. Their area has been blockaded now for many years, but, in the heartbreaking words of the United Nations Refugee Agency:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Not one drop of water, not one grain of wheat, not a liter of fuel has been allowed in the Gaza Strip for the last eight days.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Raise the alarm that as of today, my UNRWA colleagues in Gaza can no longer provide humanitarian assistance as I speak.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The UN has also said that the directions being given by the Israeli military for evacuation orders in hospitals in northern Gaza are 'a death sentence' for everyone within them, because there is nowhere for these people to go. It has also been pointed out by Amnesty and the UN and others that these orders to evacuate are not in compliance with international law. The Red Cross has been reportedly saying that there has been deliberate shelling of health facilities, and that amounts to a collective punishment of the Palestinian people for something that they are not responsible for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This looming humanitarian catastrophe is something that Australia should be joining other countries in trying everything we can to stop. We join with everyone in this parliament in mourning the 1,300 Israelis who have lost their lives, but on today's count there are also between 2,300 and 2,600 Palestinians who have lost their lives, many of who are children. And we mourn them as well. This is now moving beyond self-defence into an invasion, and it is up to Australia as a peace-loving country to join the push to stop it. No to antisemitism, no to Islamophobia and no to the war on Gaza. We stand with all of those people in Australia and around the world who want just and lasting peace and security for everyone in Israel and Palestine. And that means ending the occupation and developing a just and lasting peace, but it also means putting our efforts into an immediate cease fire of all parties and a stopping of the war and the invasion. Not only will it bring about a humanitarian catastrophe and be a likely war crime; we've got to think about what the consequences will be for the region of an invasion of an area that's occupied territory in breach of international law when we know what the other actors in that area are like. We have to push for peace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is really only paragraph (2) in the government's motion that stands in the way of us supporting it. It reads, in part, like a motion that was drafted some time ago and does not take account of the fact that we are on the eve of an invasion of this territory that not only is going to create a humanitarian catastrophe but is going to make life less safe for people living in Israel and people living in Palestine. So I move that the motion be amended as follows:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Omit paragraph (2), substitute: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(2) condemns war crimes perpetrated by the state of Israel, including the bombing of Palestinian civilians, and calls for an immediate ceasefire between all parties and an end to the war on Gaza, recognising also that for there to be peace there must be an end to the state of Israel's illegal occupation of the Palestinian Territories;</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to be standing with those Jews, Palestinians and supporters in Australia who are saying it is time to push for a just and lasting peace. We can condemn atrocities and war crimes, but that does not justify an invasion where there are 2.2 million people, 40 per cent of whom are children, who have nowhere to go. The direction for them to leave their homes so that bombing can take place is unlawful, the United Nations has said, and there is nowhere for them to go. They are walled in. That, amongst other reasons, is why an invasion is not only wrong; it is going to lead to humanitarian catastrophe. So I urge the government to reconsider that part of their motion that gives tacit support to that invasion and instead to adopt a pathway forward for peace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are millions of people around this country and around the world who want that and who know that this is the opportunity not to call for escalation of the conflict and to back an invasion but instead to call for peace so that we can mourn those who've died and, hopefully, not add to their numbers in the thousands, as an invasion is going to lead to.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Watson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Minister for the Arts and Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:31</span>):  None of us wanted to be in a parliament for a resolution in a moment in history like this. I join with all members in the condemnation of the actions of Hamas, condemnation of indiscriminate killing, condemnation of the targeting of civilians, condemnation of the taking of hostages and condemnation of what has been described accurately as the greatest loss of Jewish life in a single day since the Holocaust. I add to the view which I think the first time I saw put in these terms was by the joint statement from President Biden and a number of other world leaders, where they referred to the actions of Hamas not only as being horrific in their immediacy and as being tragic in the outcome for everybody they came near but also as being contrary to the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are legitimate aspirations for the Palestinian people. It's legitimate to want to live freely: free of occupation, free of endless checkpoints, free of a legal system which differs in the different ways that military courts do. All of that is further away now—further away than it was two weeks ago It is much, much further. The actions of Hamas have caused carnage across the Israeli community and, similarly, have provided no assistance whatsoever to Palestinians. It's important, when we talk about actions, that we don't fall into games of false equivalence. It's also important, though, that, when innocent life is lost, we mourn innocent life regardless of who it is. We mourn deaths of families wiped out, mourn grandparents brutally slain, mourn babies who had decades of life ahead of them that have been taken, and there are examples of those both Israeli and Palestinian. We need to mourn all of them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are Australians grieving for people on either side of the border, and all of those Australians who are grieving the loss of innocent life have a right to know that the parliament grieves with them, grieves for the deaths: the deaths that are known, the deaths where people are still waiting for confirmation and inevitably the deaths where confirmation will never come, where a life that was known is just never reported back again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also the ongoing grief for loss which is not loss of life but is the permanent loss to people through all the fear which lies ahead. There is the fear of something as joyous as a music festival being something where people will feel they cannot relax; the fear of something as routine as attendance at a pizza shop; the fear of being confronted at a checkpoint; and the fear of sleeping and not knowing whether, by the time morning comes, a bomb may have struck or a knock on the door may have come saying that your home is to be demolished. There is the base fear of the constant risk of terrorism and the base fear of living with a seemingly endless occupation. All of those fears are something now that will last longer as a result of what has just occurred.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The resolution in front of us calls for the upholding of international law. It is calling for the upholding of all international law: international law against the targeting of civilians; international law against the taking of hostages; and international law against collective punishment. But I want to say something quite specific about hate speech. A few people, not many, were aware of the state of my health last week, which meant that my public commentary was very limited and that when comments were eventually given to the media late in the week they were not published. Allow me to take this chance to be quite unequivocal: statements of hate speech, some of which were given in my part of Sydney and some of which were given elsewhere, are all unacceptable and are all to be condemned. There is no place for hate speech in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was particularly devastated that one of those comments was made along the pathway where my community had conducted the Walk for Respect. My community has actually been at the centre—at the absolute centre—of opposing any weakening of our hate speech laws. In my community, Jews, Muslims, Christians, Buddhists, Hindus and people of no faith at all walked together against hate speech—against all forms of hate speech. They were against racist hate speech, against antisemitism and against Islamophobia. Anyone who in years gone past has argued that we should weaken our laws against hate speech was wrong then, and anyone now who engages in hate speech, thinking that it's only words, is wrong!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must not pretend, though, that the minority engaging in hate speech is somehow representative of us as a nation or of any group as a community. It is incredibly important in how we respect and debate each other, and how we regard which words are truly representative of communities and which words are not, that we don't pretend that the sections of hate are bigger in Australia than they are. But, to the extent that they are there, we must fight them and fight them hard. When our fellow Australians mourn, when our fellow Australians fear and when our fellow Australians hope, we need to stand with them.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Farrer</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:38</span>):  I rise to support this bipartisan motion on Israel, and I commend the fine words of both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Saturday 7 October, the Jewish people suffered their worst day since the Holocaust. The merciless killing of more than 1,300 people at the hands of Hamas was barbaric. The atrocities committed were war crimes: elderly women with dementia taken hostage, soldiers beheaded and babies burned alive. These sick acts of depravity have no place in our world, but take place they did.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So today as a country and a parliament we unequivocally say two things: we stand with people of Jewish faith in this country and abroad, side by side, as you experience the most difficult period of your lives, and we stand against these acts of terror perpetrated by Hamas and support Israel taking the strongest possible action to ensure this can never happen again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After the Holocaust, the world said to the Jewish people, 'Never again'—never again would people of Jewish faith be murdered because of their religious beliefs, never again would the scale of that suffering be repeated and never again would the world stand by and allow such atrocities to occur. But on Saturday 7 October, 'never again' did happen again, and it is on that basis that we stand as one in this parliament in support of the United States and with the rest of our allies to pledge our full support to the people of Israel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I attended a vigil in the Sydney's eastern suburbs, joining with 7,000 people to pay respects and mourn with the Jewish community. I was pleased to stand with colleagues from across parties and parliaments. It's important we speak with one voice on this. At the vigil, I met Itsik Sabug. Itsik is a proud Australian of Israeli descent. Like so many people of the Jewish faith in our country, he migrated to Australia from Israel. Itsik's nephew, Ziv Shapira, who's still in Israel, went to that now infamous music festival. All Ziv wanted to do was have a good time; all he wanted to do was catch up with his friends. He wanted to enjoy the party, have a dance and have fun. Ziv was only 26 years old. Ziv never came home from that music festival—lost to his parents, lost to Itsik and lost to his friends forever. This is just one story of thousands, just one anecdote of so many in our Jewish community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is unimaginable pain for so many people in our country—pain we seek to soothe as a united parliament, pain we seek to soothe as a united people but pain that for many was compounded as a result of the disgraceful scenes we saw at Sydney's Opera House last week. We should never be in a situation in our great country where we rightly make a significant symbolic gesture to support a group of people facing trauma, only to then have such a failure in administration that this gesture backfires and further upsets them. I pay tribute to the New South Wales Premier, Chris Minns, for apologising to the Jewish community. He gave a fine speech at the vigil in Dover Heights.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is a timely reminder of just how deeply antisemitism does run across the world and even in sections of our country. We must wrap our arms around the Jewish community. We must remind them that we condemn and reject these abhorrent views. Seeing a mob chant 'gas the Jews' and 'burn the Jews' days after the Jewish people experienced their worst tragedy since the Holocaust is one of the worst things I have seen in this country. We must learn from this as national leaders. We must understand the depth of hatred that Jews face and commit to addressing it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the coming days and weeks I look forward to visiting more Jewish communities around the country. It's important that they know their national leaders support them, are listening and will act. If the Jewish community needs more funding for security upgrades, then that is what governments must deliver. If the Jewish community is telling us that some parents don't feel it's safe to send kids to school, then we need to listen, act and assure them of that safety. It's important they know where we stand locally and internationally in support of them. Every parliamentarian must denounce all acts of hate speech and antisemitism towards the Jewish people in Australia and around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course we condemn the barbaric, violent and unprovoked terrorist attack by Hamas on the people of Israel. Of course we condemn the murder, rape and hostage-taking of innocent civilians, including babies, children, women and the elderly. Of course we support the state of Israel's right to self-defence in taking action to respond to these terror attacks by Hamas, including eradicating Hamas from Gaza and dismantling the capability of Hamas to conduct terrorist attacks on the people of Israel in the future. And of course we will support the work of recognised international aid agencies to provide humanitarian assistance and protection wherever possible to all innocent civilians caught in any ensuing conflict.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Less than a year ago I travelled to Israel and the UAE with the member for Berowra as part of a study tour. Less than a year ago I was standing on those same streets in Sderot where, just last week, so many civilians were gunned down in cold blood. As I said a few weeks ago before these atrocities occurred: 'Seeing bomb shelters in the middle of kids' playgrounds is terrifying; it is sobering. It gives us pause to try to reflect on how we would feel if we had to deal with that reality in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Seeing the Hezbollah flag flying high mere metres from the Israeli border; reaching to the top of the Golan Heights, and being guided through the areas so many hostile forces routinely occupy; learning how, in Sderot, communities are surrounded by makeshift bomb shelters because of what they face so frequently. This is the only way someone can properly appreciate the real and pressing threat the people of Israel face every single day.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Israel faces these threats directly because of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Iran is funding, training and arming a whole ecosystem of terrorist organisations, including Hamas. The sole desire of Iran is to destroy the Jewish State of Israel. There's no deal to be done here. They unashamedly want to see Jewish people die and the State of Israel cease to exist. There can be no accommodation here and no compromise with Iran. They are the biggest threat to peace and order in the Middle East. The landmark Abraham Accords were changing, and can continue to change, the Middle East region for the better, and that's why Iran is so hell-bent on destroying them and stopping further agreements. The coalition stands in complete unity with the United States of America in warning Iran of the consequences should they seek any further involvement in this war. We must acknowledge that the acts of barbarity perpetrated by Hamas and the terror group's ongoing use of more than 100 innocent Israelis, including babies and children, as human shields have irrevocably changed the region. We must also reassure the Palestinians that condemning this terrorist group and its terrorist activities—the worst the world has seen since 9/11—should not, and cannot, be taken as any negative expression against the Palestinian people, with whom I have had a long and enduring friendship and connection.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make one final point. In the days and weeks ahead, Israel has rightly stated they will have no choice but to launch a very forceful response, seeking to ensure these atrocities can never occur again. Unfortunately for Hamas, civilians are always collateral damage in their quest to advance their terrorism. As civilians suffer, we must remember that this is because of one thing and one thing only: the actions of Hamas. We must stand resolutely with Israel as they respond forcibly, because the Hamas-Iran joint propaganda machine will be seeking to persuade the world that they are the victims. We must ignore that propaganda and stay strident in our support for the Jewish people, and we must all remember that their actions in the coming days and weeks are in self-defence of their people and their country. For decades now, whenever Israel has been forced to respond in situations such as these, some have been very quick to hold Israel to a standard they themselves would never meet. It forced former Israeli prime minister Golda Meir to once remark:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If we have to have a choice between being dead and pitied, and being alive with a bad image, we'd rather be alive and have the bad image.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say clearly: Israel have a good image, and they are alive. They have a good image because they are a good people and a good country. They are alive because, as we have seen for literally thousands of years of history, no matter what tragedy befalls the Jewish people, the Jewish people live and the Jewish state lives. Israel lives.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="278522" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:48</span>):  On Simhath Torah, a Jewish festival of celebration on Saturday 7 October 2023, more Jewish lives were taken on that single day than any other since 1945. It was a day of disbelief, of devastation and of panic for loved ones. My community were frantically messaging their family and friends, writing messages like: 'Are you safe? Are you okay?' The bonds between Australia's Jewish people and the people of Israel run deep. They are bonds of family and friendship. My community is feeling the devastation of seeing their brothers and sisters being terrorised in the most graphic and gruesome fashion. Yet, in all of the carnage, I witnessed humanity rise to surface. I witnessed people light up the darkness. The community came together in prayer, in solidarity and in immense sadness. We mourned with each other. We sought to comfort each other and to love one another, to help get through the collective grief that each and every single person is carrying. In that spirit of humanity, I extend my deepest sympathies to the families of those who were brutally murdered just over one week ago: to the Israelis, the Americans, the Thais, the Australians, the Kiwis, the Germans, the French, the Italians, the Bedouins and many more families who lost loved ones on that day. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me also take this moment to extend my deepest sympathies to the families of innocent Palestinians. I recognise your grief and I see your heartache. The humanity we share cannot be lost. We witnessed what happens when humanity is lost. It looks like the heinous acts of terror perpetrated by Hamas. These attacks were barbaric, abhorrent and totally unjustifiable. They were carried out by terrorists who have shown complete disregard for human life: the children, the women, the elderly people, just going about their day. I dream of seeing peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. I dream of two peoples living side by side, and that dream feels further away than ever. The true tragedy of Hamas's terror is that it was specifically designed to further divide our two peoples and to fuel this conflict. Hamas sought to indiscriminately terrorise civilians, only then to cower behind them, putting innocent people in harm's way. They are the instigator, and they continue to fire indiscriminate rockets towards civilians. Up to 150 innocent civilians have been kidnapped and taken into Gaza. The violence and terror continue. The extent of the death toll is hard to comprehend. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of us remember with horror the Bali bombings of 2002 when terrorists killed 202 people, of which 88 were Australians. Yet the rising death toll of this terror attack is more than 1,300 people. Australia has consistently stood against terrorism, and today we reaffirm our unwavering commitment to that cause. If these were Australians, what would we do? If Australian kids had been gunned down at a music festival, what would we do? If Australian babies and women and elderly people were brutally butchered in their own homes, what would we do? I know this conflict is complex—the deep history—but this week the world has seen the enormous threat to the Israeli people. Israel does not just have a right to exist; it has an obligation to protect its citizens, just as Australia does. If this attack had happened to Australia, Australians would be demanding this parliament act in a way that ensured this terror could not happen again. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The story of the Jewish people is one of extraordinary courage and resilience, but this week my community has faced a reality beyond our worst nightmares. We witnessed devastation in Israel only to be confronted with scenes at home in support of the perpetrators. Less than 24 hours after the attack, as the body count was rising, people gathered at our country's most iconic landmark, the Sydney Opera House, and chanted antisemitic slurs echoing the worst of the Holocaust. We have seen flags burnt, Nazi salutes on Melbourne trains and a stream of online abuse with justifications of the murder of innocent Jewish lives. My community is heartbroken; my people are suffering. Trying to reconcile the atrocities overseas and the scenes at home, it makes the resolute support that I and the Jewish community have received from colleagues in this parliament so meaningful. On Wednesday the Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke at the Australia Israel Chamber of Commerce. She made a speech in support of Israel that was strong and heartfelt. On Thursday the Prime Minister came to my electorate, to the St Kilda synagogue, where he met with leaders and members of the Jewish community. He spoke movingly of his support for Israel and our community. I can tell the House that the Jewish community deeply appreciated his words, just as they've deeply appreciated the words of people right across the political aisle. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the leaders of this place for their unwavering support and solidarity. I want to acknowledge people across the parliament who are hurting, including my friend the member for Berowra. I also acknowledge my state Liberal colleague David Southwick, who has stood united with me as we work to support our people in this time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We gather today to stand in solidarity with the people of Israel from within the Australian parliament, just as we stood with them as we cast the first vote in 1947 to help establish the state of Israel after witnessing the darkest chapter in human history. We must stand against terrorism, against antisemitism and against hatred in all its forms. The people of Israel, the Palestinian people and indeed all humanity deserve nothing less.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will finish with a prayer that is said by Jewish people during the daily prayers. Its underlying translation asks for one thing above all: that, for Israel, for the Jewish people and for the entire world, there should be peace. Oseh shalom bimromav, hu ya-aseh shalom aleinu, v-al kol Yisrael, v-imru amen.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:55</span>):  After a week that saw the greatest loss of Jewish lives since the Holocaust, Jews gathered at the Central Synagogue in Bondi Junction for Shabbat services, just as Jews have gathered for Shabbat services for centuries. On this particular evening, though, there was a special poignancy to their gathering, as they came together to console, support and encourage others. As the women lit their candles in hope and we gathered for the Shabbat service, which Jenny and I were pleased to attend along with the current member for Wentworth and the former member for Wentworth Dave Sharma, Rabbi Levi said, 'Am Yisrael Chai.' The people of Israel live on. It was a statement of resilience. It was a statement of faith. It was a statement of hope. If there's one thing I have learnt in my long association with the Jewish community, it is that they are a people of endurance, resilience and hope, even in the most awful circumstances, which they have experienced this past week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to stand in support of this bipartisan motion and to stand here in support of the people of Israel and the state of Israel. I stand here and condemn the barbaric, violent and unprovoked terrorist attack by Hamas on the people of Israel on 7 October and the murder, the beheading, the rape and the hostage-taking of innocent civilians, including babies, children, women and the elderly. We express our deepest sympathy and deep condolences to members of this place, to people all around our country, to the state of Israel, Prime Minister Netanyahu and all of his people and to the Jewish community here in Australia through Ambassador Amir Maimon, who I spoke to, as we denounce these terrible acts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These terrorist acts have been rightly identified as terrorist acts. To speak of this as a war is to somehow risk legitimising the other combatant for which there can be no legitimacy whatsoever. They are terrorists. As Prime Minister I was pleased that we listed in full Hamas as a terrorist organisation as well as Hezbollah and many others, because that is indeed what they are. As we gather in this place and rightly denounce and condemn these acts, I hope it will not fade from our memory quickly or ever, because that is too often the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember, as the member for Berowra will remember, back in December 2018, the UN General Assembly considered a resolution condemning Hamas for repeatedly firing rockets into Israel and for inciting violence, thereby putting civilians at risk, and for its use of resources in Gaza to construct military infrastructure, including tunnels to infiltrate Israel and equipment to launch rockets into civilian areas. It specified that further engagement by the UN Secretary-General and the UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, in efforts to de-escalate the situation in Gaza, was also needed. I instructed that we would support that motion in condemning Hamas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A procedural vote was held before that main vote on the resolution, calling for the main resolution to be decided on a two-thirds majority. It was passed in that chamber, narrowing the odds of the resolution passing successfully. Although 87 voted in favour, including Australia, a majority either voted against or abstained, meaning that the resolution failed under the ruling. Before the vote, the US permanent representative to the UN said that, despite more than 500 General Assembly resolutions condemning Israel at the United Nations, not one had condemned Hamas—not one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we stand in this place, appalled, aggrieved and with our hearts breaking, we should not be surprised by this barbarous violence from such a group. They should never have been given the leave pass of legitimacy that they experienced for so long from the international community. They should have always been condemned, and may they forever be condemned. So we stand here and say we will support the State of Israel's right to self-defence—as we should in this motion—in taking action to respond to these terror acts, but let us know that this should and must include all efforts to eradicate Hamas from Gaza and dismantling the capability of Hamas to conduct terrorist attacks on the people and State of Israel in the future. In the weeks and the months ahead, let our resolve not diminish. Let our eyes not turn away from what we say today, as we continue to support the State of Israel's legitimate right to defend itself and remove that ever-present threat that has stood there each and every day, threatening their citizens as they go about their peaceful lives. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I join the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in saying that we as Australia should call on the Islamic Republic of Iran to cease its funding, training and arming of terrorist organisations that include Hamas. We cannot look away from the support that Hamas has received from Iran. It is an abomination. They are the funders of this terrible violence. If they approved it, we will not know. Hamas, of its own accord, is capable of engaging in such violent barbarism all of its own making, but its ability to do so could not have occurred without the training, funding and assistance provided by Iran. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we say in the motion, we must also support the work of humanitarian assistance and the humanitarian corridors to call for the immediate and unconditional release of the hostages, to enable safe passage and to prevent innocent civilians being further caught in what will be an ensuing conflict, which I fear will be quite awful. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I particularly commend the consular work being undertaken by DFAT officials and the bravery they've shown on so many occasions. I recall the bravery they showed as they went into Wuhan at the outset of the COVID crisis, and here they are again, assisting Australians. I thank Qantas for their work, once again, coming to Australians' aid. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should also be looking ahead and working to support other international organisations in dialogue so that, once order is restored to Gaza, there be the transfer of administrative authority over the Gaza Strip to a credible and competent Palestinian led authority. We must acknowledge and continue to encourage and support the progress being made towards peace in the Middle East through the establishment of the Abraham Accords, whose work should not be frustrated or delayed by these actions. Of course, we reaffirm our support for the establishment of a viable and sustainable two-state solution in Israel and the Palestinian territories, behind recognised international borders. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this day, as we stand in this place, let us be clear. Let us say, with Rabbi Levi and all the people of the Jewish community here in Australia and around the world, 'Am Yisrael chai.'</span>

                  <a href="91219" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUSIC</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Industry and Science</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:04</span>):  Anyone with a surname like mine carries a legacy, genetic and historic. They come from a part of the world—it once had a name, Yugoslavia—where people of different faiths and ethnicities were as tight as brothers and sisters. They shared all the special religious and personal events and they sang songs together about a country that was outside of an anthem. It was truly a special bond. Then, in a matter of years, that bond disappeared and the most depraved acts occurred between people who had said that they loved each other like brothers and sisters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the impact of hate and the way it tears apart societies; I've carried that since my 20s. There are a lot of people who have seen similar episodes in different parts of the world. It comes to the fore at moments like this and hate drives people to do the most barbaric of actions. That hate-propelling violence is something that we all must not only recoil from; we have to act against it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like many people the world over, we've been aghast at what we saw in Israel on 7 October. It was an absolute abomination. Hamas must be, and is rightly being, condemned. The way in which they targeted infants, women and the elderly was on the basis of their faith, and so many Jewish people lost their lives in a way that was completely and utterly unacceptable. We feel deeply for them and we grieve with Israelis the world over who are feeling this deeply. All the hostages must absolutely be released without condition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also acknowledge that any government that is confronted with these acts within its own borders will respond. They have to respond. They have to hold Hamas to account, and that will happen. Too many Israelis and Palestinians have, since 7 October, paid an utterly horrific price, and I'm deeply concerned about what will happen from here. I also think deeply about what will happen in Gaza, where two million people are crammed in. There'll be a lot of innocent Palestinians who will pay a price for the actions of Hamas. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I restate this: Hamas must absolutely be held to account. Innocent Palestinians should be protected. They should be given passage. They should be able to get out of harm's way. They should be preserved as well, in the sense of not being targeted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think about what we can do in regard to something that is so far away. A simple and powerful proposition is to always be conscious of the humanity of others. I recognise—I think any student of history recognises—that there have been moments in time where the violent refusal to recognise the humanity of others has written the worst chapters of humanity. Specifically, in those moments when I think of my friends in the Jewish community and the intergenerational trauma created by the Holocaust, I remember what has driven that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think of many shared meals, from Shabbat to iftar, and I think of the bonds that are being created through those moments. I know it's very hard. Those warm memories will be pressed to the deepest recesses of minds. They will be moved out by the memories that are being created or may be made in the coming weeks. But being conscious of humanity will be an important way in which we preserve what we value most in this country. It should be at the front line of our fight against antisemitism and Islamophobia. It has been at the heart of the work of people like the member for Cowan, who sits behind me. I thank her deeply for what she has done in taking up the fight against extremism and the way in which it tears communities apart.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On these points—and I'm very grateful to have been able to express a few remarks in this very important debate we are having—not all Israelis are Jewish and not all Palestinians are Muslim, but everyone is feeling a dread at the moment. Regardless of your faith or ethnicity, all Israelis and Palestinians are absolutely entitled to the right to a future, free from the weight of fear. They should be able to build better lives for themselves and do what everyone of us who are parents want: to build a better life for the ones that follow. They should be able to do it within the state of Israel, and they should be able to do it in a state of Palestine. I thank the House.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="109556" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LEESER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:10</span>):  Members of the House have visited Jewish community centres and synagogues and schools during their service in this place. Inevitably members have to pass through a security station and often wonder why there's security. After all, this is Australia. This is Australia. We're one of the few nations on earth that has never had any formal discrimination against Jewish people, and I honour that history. Yet, even with that history, Jewish Australians have felt the pain of the murder of Jews in Israel. Hamas attacks in Israel have reminded Jews across the world that in each generation we face those who seek to exterminate Jewish people from the face of the earth. Events in Israel have brought that long history that silently lives in our DNA and our memory as a people back to life. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst our own sense of decency and humanity instinctively turns us away from looking at the depravity, we must not turn away—depravity that saw whole families murdered together in their homes; babies captured, caged and killed; young women sexually assaulted in the streets; a grandmother murdered, and images of her body uploaded to her own social media page; hundreds of young people at a music festival to celebrate peace mowed down by terrorists in body armour and brandishing AK-47s. Not all were Israelis. The murdered and missing included people from 43 nations around the world. One hundred and fifty people were dragged from their homes and kidnapped, one of whom was an elderly Holocaust survivor. With 1,300 dead, in a matter of hours there was the greatest loss of Jewish life in a single day since the Holocaust. History repeats itself again—another time and another evil group who seek nothing less than the extermination of the Jewish people from Israel and, if they could have their way, from the entire earth. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I appreciate the serious work being undertaken to bring home the Australians who want to come home. I commend all who are burning the midnight oil to get this done safely and quickly. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also believe we must use this moment to reconsider our diplomatic relationship with Iran. Iran oppresses its people. Iran exports terror and has aided and supported terrorist organisations such as Hamas for far too long. I do not believe it is in our national interest to have diplomatic relations with a country that seeks to export terror throughout the world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">May I say a few words about the response in our country. It has been simultaneously wonderful and troubling. We have an expression in Hebrew: Kol Yisrael Arevim Zeh bah Zeh. Loosely translated it means 'All the people of Israel take care of each other'. But, in this instance, we've seen not just the people of Israel taking care of each other but the people of goodwill of Australia taking care of each other. I want to put on record my thanks to the people who've sent emails, reached out with messages of goodwill, and the social media posts of people standing with Israel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like many people in this House, over the last few weeks I've been occupied with prepoll. What was lovely at the prepoll is that it didn't matter what side of the debate people were on; volunteers, members of the community, came up to me and shook my hand and hugged me and said: 'We stand with you, Julian. We stand with the people of Israel and the Jewish people at this time.' There was the beautiful gesture from Susan and the people of St Stephen's Normanhurst, who dropped flowers at my office, not sure of what to do or how to express their support and their feelings about the actions in Israel. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were other actions that troubled me and troubled Jewish Australians and Australians of goodwill, and that was the public emergence of an awful form of antisemitism. What happened in our greatest city, Sydney, was nothing short of appalling. I never could have imagined a day when Jewish people in Sydney would be told by the police that the streets were not safe, nor indeed that the same police would arrest a man carrying an Israeli flag while giving an escort to the steps of the Opera House to antisemites celebrating the work of a listed terrorist organisation—which we in Australia have listed—murdering Jewish innocents. Nor could I have imagined that antisemites would light flares and chant, 'Gas the Jews!' on the steps of Australia's greatest cultural symbol while the police watched on—'Gas the Jews! Kill the Jews!' at the Sydney Opera House in 2023! These people should be prosecuted for inciting the murder of their fellow Australians and, if possible, removed from our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More broadly, we need a serious debate about antisemitism. Antisemitism is always accompanied by an indifference to antisemitism. In too many places in the political sphere and the social sphere, the brutal terrorist acts were met with statements of false equivalence—as if innocent Jewish people had brought these murders on themselves. We've all heard this script before: so many of these people lecture us incessantly about tolerance and hate speech; inclusion and racism; and indifference to violence against women. But they've shown that none of their beliefs apply to Jews: the Jewish people are the asterisk where it doesn't apply. This moral equivalence is a failure of moral compass. The indifference of these people and their disregard for their fellow Australians has been on display over the past week, and I have to say that it has been particularly evident in some of the statements by members of the Greens party at the state and federal level.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, antisemitism in Australia is not uncommon: unfortunately, I experience it regularly. The member for Wentworth, the member for Macnamara and I co-chair the Parliamentary Friends of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, opposing antisemitism. Let me let the House in on our work. Unfortunately, the places where antisemitism is alive and well are on the many campuses of our country. There are too many Quisling leaders on our campuses who do not have the strength to stop antisemitism and who refuse to adopt the IHRA definition of antisemitism. Many refuse to define antisemitism and they think we're making it up! It's festering, and we saw it on the streets of Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a trying time for Jewish people around the world and here in Australia. I draw strength from the many non-Jewish people around the country who are reaching out to stand with the Jewish people at this time. And I draw strength from the broad primary support for this motion. I believe in what we call the vast middle of this country: good, fair, decent people who stand against evil. I draw strength from what Rabbi Jonathan Sacks said of the Jewish people, 'They are the voice of hope in the conversation of humankind.' He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Our ability to survive some of the worst tragedies any people has known without losing our faith in life itself; to suffer and yet rebuild; to lose and yet recreate; to honour the past without being held captive by the past—all of which are embodied today in the State of Israel, living symbol of the power of hope—are vitally important not just to ourselves but to the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East. It's a country that shares the values of Australia: a belief in the rule of law and democracy, and respect for human rights. It's one of the few places in the Middle East where not only Jews but Christians and Muslims can practice their faith freely. Australia and Israel share values and an outlook on the world. Australia must stand with the people of Israel and it is right that Australia does so.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  Swan Hill Rural City Council mayor Les McPhee is a proud advocate for his community. He was on the front page of the local paper last week, supporting my call for answers from the minister for infrastructure about the Swan Hill Bridge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For 50 years the people of Swan Hill and their New South Wales neighbours have been calling for a new bridge. In 2019 the coalition provided $60 million in funding for the project. Sadly since then the project has been held up by two state heritage and planning departments. Now the minister has put this priority project into her 90-day infrastructure review. It is now 169 days since the minister announced this 90-day review, while Mayor McPhee and the good people of Swan Hill still don't have an answer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister says she is consulting with her state and territory counterparts, but Mayor McPhee rightly pointed out that the minister should be consulting with me, as the local representative. Labor politicians seem to only know where regional Victorian seats like Mallee are when they want to swan in and claim the credit for coalition projects. They shun any other advice, particularly when it comes from electorates where the people see right through the usual city-centric policies Labor are well-known for. I say this to the minister: my door is open for you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  Over the weekend, the Illawarra's biggest celebration of music, arts and culture, the Yours and Owls Festival, took place at its new home at the University of Wollongong. The two-day annual music festival has been running for almost 10 years, having battled through the pandemic, which ended with them hosting the first COVID-safe festival in New South Wales, in 2021. Yours and Owls was co-founded by proud UOW alumni Adam Smith, Ben Tillman, and Balunn Jones. Turning a small cafe into one of Australia's most respected music brands is not ordinary journey, but it's one that is now ingrained in the Illawarra's culture. The trio are passionate about sustainability, keeping this front of mind when planning their events and festivals, which feature reusable cups and an entire sustainability team on the ground.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year saw nearly 20,000 attendees enjoy local, national and international acts across five stages spread across the university campus. A big shout-out to the UOW Vice Chancellor, Professor Patricia Davidson, for welcoming Wollongong's favourite festival with open arms. To Adam, Ben and Bal, thank you so much for cultivating a festival and brand that the Illawarra is so proud of. After nearly 10 years of operating in our region, you are a vital part of the Illawarra, bringing economic opportunity, support for local artists and a sense of community—where people from all walks of life come together to enjoy live music. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It is well known that young people living in rural and regional areas have a higher rate of mental health issues than their peers in the big cities. We see it in the news all the time, and it's no different for the people living in my electorate of Dawson. Back in 2013, the coalition government secured the funding to open this facility. Since then, headspace Mackay has provided invaluable and often life-saving support for our 12 to 25-year-olds who are facing the turbulent reality of adolescence. For that reason, I would like to celebrate and thank the staff of headspace Mackay for everything that they have done for our region in the last 10 years.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Being able to access critical healthcare services is a basic human need. Early intervention is critical to ensure our youth grow up to reach their full potential and live long, happy, healthy and adventurous lives. Again, thank you, headspace Mackay, for all you have done and will continue to do for our young people of Dawson. You are the unsung heroes and you should be incredibly proud of what you do, because I certainly am.</span>

Emily is a nurse at Gosford Hospital on the New South Wales Central Coast. She has been nominated for this recognition because of her outstanding contribution in providing and coordinating safe, quality and compassionate patient care and in consistently displaying the values of commitment, compassion, resilience, professionalism and collaboration. Emily has shown commitment to, and passion for, the nursing profession by going the extra mile and demonstrating a can-do positive attitude throughout her patient care.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia there are around half a million registered nurses and midwives, making the profession one of the largest clinical workforces in the country. As an emergency doctor, I see how hard our nurses and midwives work in ensuring our community receives the best patient care in our hospitals when they need it. Nurses have had a tough past few years battling the COVID-19 pandemic and caring for the vulnerable members of our community. We owe so much to our empathetic and diligent nurses, and I thank all the nurses on the Central Coast for their work, as well as all nurses right across the country. To Emily, I give my congratulations again on your recognition and I wish you all the best at the upcoming excellence in nursing and midwifery award ceremony in mid-November—keep shining.</span>

The purpose of the group was to stand with our First Nations people to inform and deliver a 'yes' vote at the Voice referendum, while celebrating the values of respect, fairness and unity. Solid campaigning over 16 weeks across the Goldstein electorate saw over 500 volunteers—ranging in age from Harrison, who's 10, to Martin, who's in his 90s—deliver 285 community engagement events and activities, including street meets, leafletting at train stations and markets, doorknocking and kitchen table conversations. In addition to this there were more than 1,500 'yes' fence signs on display, and over one five-day period 62,000 leaflets were letterboxed by our volunteers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the campaign, Bunurong and Boonwurrung elders of the Kulin nations, which take in the lands and waters of Goldstein, told me they wanted me and us to vote yes. On the weekend, the people of Goldstein accepted that respectful request. The national result differs—and that's democracy—but in Goldstein, even when our views and votes have differed, we've come out stronger and better as a community for having actively participated in this important moment in history together.</span>

There are a lot of things in this place that we can't agree on or don't agree on, but there is one thing that we do agree on. I'm co-chair of the 'parliamentary friends of the Collingwood Football Club'—Go the Pies!—and I've got my colleague Aaron Violi and the member for Aston, who's a co-chair, here as well. Congratulations to Craig McRae, the coach, for a wonderful year; Darcy Moore, the captain; and all the Collingwood players as a team. It was a marvellous day at the MCG, with Bobby Hill; the goal by Jordan de Goey to get us back in front; and Nick Daicos. It was a beautiful day for Collingwood supporters and for neutral supporters around the country. We all agree on this: we love our football. Congratulations, Collingwood Football Club. Over to you, member for Casey.</span>

Congratulations to the president, Jeff Browne; CEO, Craig Kelly; coach, Craig McRae; and captain, Darcy Moore. It was a wonderful result on that Saturday. It was a great game and I'm glad to be co-chair, with the member for Wills, and to see Collingwood get up. It was a great opportunity for families to come together and celebrate. I will finish by giving a shout-out to my uncle Sam. I know he enjoyed the day; he was the man that got me in love with the Collingwood Football Club. It was a great day. As the member for Wills said, there's a lot we can't agree on but we can definitely agree on how great the Collingwood Football Club being premiers for 2023 is.</span>

Mortgages are harder to pay and rents are rising. Some people are facing homelessness for the first time. Others wonder how their children or their grandchildren will ever be able to afford to buy a home. Everywhere I go, people want the government to stop tinkering around the edges and instead take bold, decisive action to fix the housing crisis. That's why I'm doing something that federal politicians rarely do: I am urging the state government to build more homes in my local community.</span>

This is a golden opportunity to build more social and affordable homes in our area. More social housing in our community will help the most vulnerable in our community to avoid homelessness and to deal with the current crisis in housing and in the cost of living, while at the same time taking pressure off the Victorian rental market.</span>

With communities like mine, the community of Kooyong, ready to welcome more homes, the federal government should lead from the front. It should work with the states, and I call on the federal government and the Victorian state government to get more homes built and to get this housing crisis under control.</span>

The students of the college have had much to celebrate this year. The talented years 7, 8 and 9 dance academy students who participated in the School to Stage dance competition achieved outstanding results, and four years 11 and 12 girls had their artwork displayed at exhibitions during the year.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the House record its deep sadness at the deaths on 28 July 2023 of Captain Danniel Lyon, Lieutenant Maxwell Nugent, Warrant Officer Class 2 Joseph Phillip Laycock and Corporal Alexander Naggs in Queensland while taking part in Exercise Talisman Sabre, place on record its appreciation of their service to their country, and tender its profound sympathy to their families and colleagues in their bereavement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of our most solemn duties in this place is to speak the names of those who have fallen in our nation's name, those who have stepped up for their homeland but have been unable to return home to their families. Today, we speak the names of four brave Australians: Captain Danniel Lyon, Lieutenant Maxwell Nugent, Warrant Officer Class 2 Joseph Phil Laycock and Corporal Alexander Naggs—four names eternally joined in the final moment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been nearly three months since the tragic accident that cut short their lives. While our shock has slowly retreated, sorrow is a tide that never goes out. We say their names because each name holds within it the entirety of a lifetime. I say to their families, their loved ones and their mates: I did not share your privilege of knowing them—your husbands, your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your friends. I never saw Captain Lyons' smile light up a room, I never saw the way that Warrant Officer Laycock treated his workplace and his kitchen as equally worthy avenues for his precision, and I did not know Lieutenant Nugent's wicked sense of humour or his love of dogs, nor did I have the pleasure of experiencing Corporal Nagg's kindness and generosity. But I have had the honour of speaking with their families. The most difficult thing that I have had to do as the 31st Prime Minister of Australia is ring and speak with their families in the days which followed this tragedy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also had the great honour of meeting them, along with the Deputy Prime Minister and defence minister and the representative of the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Petrie, at the 6th Aviation Regiment memorial service that was held at Holsworthy Barracks. At that solemn occasion, we also had the opportunity to talk with their comrades, who all felt, understandably, that they had also lost multiple members of their family. That is the nature of service—how the men and women who proudly wear our uniform and risk their lives in order to defend our democracy, our freedom and our way of life feel about each other. So, while I did not share in the joy of their lives, I share in the grief over their deaths. These men were four soldiers in a proud army. They were also the heart of four families—the centre of four universes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We speak of war's terrible toll, but, as this accident has so tragically reminded us, peace is also not without a price. There are no easy days for those who serve, no days without risk—or indeed for their families, for they also serve. We know each family feels such pride in the ADF member in their midst that they take on a burden for the rest of us. We cannot leave them to shoulder it alone. Our expressions of sympathy must contain the weight of our debt to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, as we remember these four fine Australians, we also remember the higher purpose that they served. Exercise Talisman Sabre brought together 13 nations and more than 30,000 service personnel. Captain Lyon, Lieutenant Nugent, Warrant Officer Laycock and Corporal Naggs were taking part because Australia was sending our very best. This was an exercise founded in a spirit of international cooperation, with the shared goal of a more secure and stable region and a more peaceful world. That is the noble ambition, the proud tradition and the high calling to which these four Australians were committed that day and every single day of their service. We honour them, we mourn them and, with their names held within our hearts, we will remember them. Lest we forget.</span>

                  <a href="00AKI" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DUTTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dickson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:07</span>):  I thank the Prime Minister for his fine words and I join him in reflecting on the terrible incident which occurred during Exercise Talisman Sabre on Friday 28 July. In that moment of disaster at 10.30 pm in the Whitsundays we lost four magnificent men of the Australian Army: Captain Danniel Lyon, Lieutenant Maxwell Nugent, Warrant Officer Class 2 Joseph Laycock and Corporal Alexander Naggs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ordeal of tragedy is to contend with loss most profound, heartache most intense and pain most enduring. Australians around the country can only imagine the ordeal which four families continue to endure. We grieve for them and we mourn for them. We think about the many people who were close to these four magnificent men: their friends, their communities, and their fellow service men and women, especially from Sydney's 6th Aviation Regiment in Holsworthy Barracks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the wake of a tragedy like this, it's the humble duty of those in this place, as the Prime Minister rightly pointed out before, to do the best to illuminate the meaning behind the tragedy, not because our words can diminish the sorrow—our words never can and never will—but because our words can cast a light on what made these fine Australians tick. In that appreciation we are reminded of the brilliance of our national character. In that recognition we look to the examples of these men to inspire the best in ourselves. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These four magnificent men were taking part in a training drill. The training drill was part of a broader 13-nation exercise. That exercise is one of many, many military activities which contribute to a critical mission: the mission to preserve peace and to deter aggression against our country and our friends in the region. These four magnificent men were not just doing their job. They chose to commit themselves to the most vital of endeavours during these most precarious times. They were duty driven, they were noble minded and they were brave beyond our imagination. And their sacrifice casts no doubt in the mind of any ally, or indeed any adversary, about Australia's commitment to preventing the horrors of history being repeated. This tragic event has rocked all our men and women in uniform. That's been the case for generations past wherever there has been a loss of life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of those men and women in uniform, of course, have young children themselves. Many of those children at a time like this may themselves be asking, 'Will my mum or dad be safe when they're training or when they're away on deployment?' As parliamentarians we'd be dishonest if we were to make that guarantee to those children, as much as it might provide some reassurance. Instead may we say to those children that their mum or their dad, or in some cases their mum and their dad, do dangerous work to keep the rest of us safe. They are the few who protect the many. Their dad's or their mum's service is the definitive expression of love, the love of everything worth defending: their family, their country, freedom and peace. There is nothing more honourable. There is nothing more necessary. There is no-one we owe a greater debt to than our soldiers, sailors and aviators. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two years ago I spoke at a 25th anniversary of the Black Hawk disaster, which claimed the lives of 18 Australians. That fateful night in June 1996, just like the fateful night on 28 July this year, reinforced the risks our service men and women face even when they're just training. We cannot eliminate tragedy in life, but it is our tragic sensibility which will see Australians provide the families of the fallen with the support, the strength and the solace they will need as they endure this terrible ordeal. It is our tragic sensibility which will see the Australian Defence Force carrying on doing what it has always done: serving Australia, safeguarding Australia, sacrificing for Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the Australian Defence Force, our partners, especially the United States, and the Queensland police and emergency services for their work in the initial search effort and the ongoing recovery operation. They've been doing delicate and difficult work in testing conditions. The black box has been recovered, and the investigation is ongoing. I hope Defence and the government will soon be in a position to release the findings for the sake of the families and colleagues of our deceased servicemen. Moreover I welcome the defence minister's decision on 29 September to permanently ground the entire Taipan fleet early, given the helicopter's chequered history. I also want to thank the member for Petrie, the shadow minister for defence personnel, who represented the coalition at the poignant memorial service on 27 September for our fallen soldiers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the coalition, I offer my heartfelt condolences and abiding gratitude to the families of Captain Lyon, Lieutenant Nugent, Warrant Officer Laycock and Corporal Naggs. May they rest in peace. Lest we forget.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corio</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:12</span>):  I thank the Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition for their words. Sudden tragedy is arresting. It is literally unbelievable. There is an almost tangible feeling that the person who walked through the door yesterday will walk through the door again tomorrow. This is all the more so when that tragedy is playing out in public, when unexpected and unfamiliar cameras and news reports, which are normally telling the story of the world, are suddenly telling a story about you and your pain. For the families of these four man, this has been a massive tear in the fabric of their lives. It's been a chasm, a moment which will define a before and an after, and it has been completely surreal. Yet there are four very real people involved. There is real tragedy and there is real loss. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Danniel Lyon was a born leader. He lit up a room when he entered. He had a rare ability to connect and he touched so many people in his life. Be it on the football field or in uniform, people looked to Danniel, and they followed him. Max Nugent, with a wicked sense of humour, tall and gangly, not really the physique to fly a helicopter, was so determined, in a way which characterised his life, to pursue his dream of aviation that when he did actually sit in the seat those around him discovered that he was a natural aviator. Phil Laycock was the oldest of the group, mature and a father of three. 'Serious' and 'dutiful' are words which have been used to describe him. In 2014 he was the Army Aviation Corps Soldier of the Year, a man to be admired. And Alex Naggs was a private person but a person who was generous, hardworking and caring, the kind of person you'd want on your team. What's really clear in speaking with the families and reading their words is the presence that each of these four men had in their lives and, correspondingly, the hole which has now been left.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the night of this accident, these four men were participating in Exercise Talisman Sabre. It is the biggest exercise of the Australian Defence Force, which occurs every two years. Obviously, in its exercise, the Defence Force seeks to replicate as much as possible what would happen in combat. Otherwise there's no point to the exercise. So this is dangerous. It carries necessary risk—on this occasion, flying a helicopter in the dark of night over water at very low altitude with stealth. We don't yet know what went wrong on that tragic night. We will find out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we do know is that this exercise was demonstrating Australia's capability and demonstrating it with our partners. As such, it had a strong deterrent effect and, accordingly, was playing its part in maintaining the peace and security of the region in which we live. On the night of this accident, those four men, in getting into that helicopter, were making a difference. Their sacrifice is as meaningful as that of any who have lost their life wearing our nation's uniform. So today our nation honours them. We honour them in the history of the Army Aviation Corps, we honour them in the history of the Australian Defence Force and we honour them for their service to our nation. Lest we forget.</span>

Our uniform men and women use helicopters to protect our forces over land and sea, and it is not without risk. Over the last 30 years we have lost too many people in helicopter crashes. In 1996 in Townsville we lost 18 fine Australians in the Black Hawk crashes. In 2005 in the Nias Island Sea King crash we lost nine fine Australians. In 2006 we lost two fine Australians off waters in Fiji when a Black Hawk crashed off HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Kanimbla</span><span style="font-style:italic;">.</span> In Afghanistan we lost six more fine Australians in helicopter crashes in 2010, 2011 and 2012. And today we remember the four men who perished in July of this year.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Helicopters are essential to our capability, but they are not without risks. Yet our ADF continue to fly them and embrace the challenges of protecting our country. That's what our four servicemen were doing on the night of 20 July—flying a special operations mission profile over water at night, because they knew our country needs men and women who can undertake the toughest missions we ask of them. They were part of the 6th Aviation Regiment, a unit that is directed for special operations tasking—short notice, complex missions in the national interest.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motto of the Australian Army Aviation Corps is vigilance. That night they were living the motto; they were being vigilant on our behalf. They died serving us. May we, in this House, be vigilant as we care for their loved ones and make good on their sacrifice by ensuring we do our job in protecting this country we all love. </span>

Australians are questioning the competence of this Prime Minister, knowing he's clearly not across the detail of decisions which he's making which adversely affect the lives of Australians. The economic decisions have resulted in prices going up and up. Energy policy is a disaster with power prices going up and up. The $450 million referendum was against advice and resulted in our country being divided. Will the Prime Minister apologise to the Australian people?</span>

The Leader of the Opposition has never seen a policy that he doesn't oppose. He's opposed all of the measures that we've put in place, and we've put in place a few. In recent times we passed the Housing Australia Future Fund through the parliament, unlocking $10 billion in investments in social and affordable housing—opposed by those opposite. The government committed a further billion dollars for public and community housing—opposed by those opposite. I went to Whyalla looking at the transition which is occurring in the steel industry there, moving towards green hydrogen producing green steel. I, along with the South Australian government, announced the upgrade of Port Bonython to assist in that process.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We hosted the National Disaster Preparedness Summit here, contrasting with what occurred in the lead-up to 2019 where the attitude was: 'Nothing to see here.' It was the first time the summit has ever been hosted here in this parliament, bringing together key stakeholders including from federal, state and territory emergency services, logistics, food and groceries, utilities and the non-government sector. We've released the employment white paper, mapping the future for good jobs, skills and training in Australia. We'll have more to say about that later today. We announced projects from the $2 billion Social Housing Accelerator with the Victorian and New South Wales governments.</span>

During recent times, we attended the ASEAN and the East Asia Summit in Indonesia with our most important of friends, promoting prosperity and stability in our region. I was the first Prime Minister in two decades to visit the Philippines and elevate our relationship and the strategic partnership. At the G20 in India, we advocated for Australia's interests in clean energy and economic resilience. Australia is once again around the chamber.</span>

The referendum on Saturday did not return the result that I'd hoped for, but I respect the decision and the democratic process that produced it. In this country, we can make the big decisions peacefully and as equals. We know that referendums are hard. That's why only eight of 45 have passed, none without bipartisan support. I certainly accept responsibility for the decisions that I have taken.</span>

No-one can say that just keeping doing the same thing is good enough for Australia. What has occurred in recent times is a much greater national awareness. We need to channel that into a national purpose to find the answers. The referendum was about listening to people and about getting better outcomes, and these principles will continue to guide me.</span>

We will address them with hope in our heart, with faith in each other and with kindness towards one another, walking together in a spirit of unity and healing. The great Australian story goes back some 65,000 years. We have an opportunity as parliamentarians to write the next chapter. As a government, we have a responsibility to write the next chapter as well, a chapter that sees the gap closing because we know that only four out of 19 targets are on track as we speak. Australians know that that is not good enough, and that is why we must seek to achieve that change. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, out of courtesy, will have her question read again.</span>

                  </a>  My question is to the Prime Minister and concerns his divisive and incompetently managed referendum. Why did the Prime Minister, in the words of the member for Macarthur, focus on 'inner-city elites'? Why did he refuse to hold a constitutional convention? Why did he make no effort to achieve bipartisanship? Why did he waste $450 million of taxpayers' money? And why did he proceed when it was clear his vanity project was going so disastrously wrong?</span>

There was one established under the former government, in 2017, after a process, under Tony Abbott, to establish a working group who were charged with coming back to the Australian people about what form constitutional recognition should take. That was after John Howard, of course, and every other leader since, promised to promote constitutional recognition. In 2017—</span>

                  </a>  After a process in 2017, First Nations people, through the Uluru Statement from the Heart, those eloquent 440 words, issued an invitation to Australians to walk with them on the form of recognition they sought, which was recognition through a voice. There were then processes established, including, under the former government, the Calma-Langton report and other processes, such as the joint committee chaired by Patrick Dodson and Julian Leeser, to progress this issue. I said, before the election, on a range of occasions, as did both leaders—Scott Morrison and Bill Shorten—prior to 2019, that there would be advance on these issues. I was at Garma when the former Minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, said that there would be a referendum held. I was there in 2019.</span>

I believe that when you make a commitment, including a commitment to Indigenous people, it should be fulfilled. I'll make this point. Across remote areas dominated by Indigenous communities, 'yes' recorded massive support: Wadeye, 92 per cent; the Tiwis, 84 per cent; Maningrida, 88 per cent; Mornington Island, 78 per cent; Yarrabah, 76 per cent; Palm Island, 74 per cent; and Leonora, 79 per cent.

After a decade where those opposite neglected and hollowed out Australia's skills sector leaving us with shortages across the country, we've made investing in skills a national priority, making sure that Australians have the skills they need to get good jobs. It's good for Australians, good for the economy and good for our future. Prior to the election we committed to create Jobs and Skills Australia to identify what the jobs of the future would be and make sure Australians were skilled up for them, whether that be through TAFE or university or some other form of training. It's why arising from the Jobs and Skills Summit last year we have now committed to 480,000 fee-free TAFE places. We committed to 180,000 this year, and we have not only met that target but exceeded it substantially, with 214,000 places being taken up already. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are delivering on the employment white paper by investing in TAFE centres of excellence. These will increase the collaboration between universities and the VET sector and deliver the skills and knowledge our economy requires. We will make sure that we can deliver for the workforce needs of the future in aged care, clean energy, manufacturing and construction. We're improving foundation skills delivery because one in five adults have alarming gaps in literacy, numeracy and digital literacy. We are lifting apprenticeship completion rates and supporting more women, First Nations people and people from a range of backgrounds to access apprenticeships. We're working with the states because we know that, when it comes to TAFE and skills, we have to work with states and territories, and that is precisely what we're doing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This evening the National Cabinet will meet to progress the next stage in our new National Skills Agreement, something we've been working on over weeks and months and something that, over the past fortnight, I have had one-on-one discussions on with every premier and chief minister across the states and territories. I want to pay tribute as well to the minister, who has done such an extraordinary job in driving this agenda that will hopefully be completed this evening with a forward-looking agenda to take us years ahead. This is an essential component of economic growth and making sure we have an economy that works for people, not the other way around. </span>

The sad truth is that the former Liberal government was irresponsible in managing Australia's Antarctic Program. Because of that, we've had three inquiries into the Antarctic Division in just 18 months: the recent Senate inquiry and before that the Nash and Russell inquiries. Those inquiries uncovered the fact that there were very serious bullying and harassment in the Australian Antarctic Division, and we are working to clean up that mess. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also locked in significant long-term funding for the Australian Antarctic Program. In fact, its budget is going up every year, year after year, for the next three years, and it is higher every year than it would have been under those opposite. Fixing the Antarctic Program is a big job, but we are getting on with it. As Dr Brian Miller, a current employee of the division, told the Senate inquiry this month, 'I believe the ship is turning. I feel like things are getting better slowly. Twelve months ago I would not have appeared before this committee because I would have feared the repercussions.' He went on to say: 'We know the importance of the work. We need some help to get back on track, so we can do the important work we've been sent out to do.' </span>

                  </a>  She's very proud of it, she interjects. It can't sail under the bridge in Hobart, which means that it can't refuel in Hobart, currently. In fact, the ship, since it was delivered in 2021, has spent 18 months in dry dock. The budget overruns are because we've been having to rent vessels to replace the <span style="font-style:italic;">Nuyina</span>, because it's been in dry dock for the 18 months since it was delivered. I understand the concerns of the member for Clark. We're fixing up the mess that those opposite left us, but we are absolutely determined to make sure that world-class science stays in Hobart and that we continue our international obligations in Antarctica.</span>

Can I thank her for the question, because it is true to say, upon election, we were faced with a very broad and deep skills shortage across the economy and the labour market. In fact, we had many, many jobs that were in need of supply, skills and labour. The OECD had reported that we had the second-highest labour shortage, per capita, amongst OECD countries. We saw the occupations on the shortage list, in 12 months, go from 153 to 286, before election. We were bequeathed a very significant skills shortage on top of the Liberal Party debt. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">For that reason, we had to respond quickly. Can I thank the Prime Minister and the Treasurer for having the foresight to convene a jobs and skills summit, with very short notice, bringing together all governments, industry, unions, universities and the VET sector in order to ensure that we had a strategic plan to supply skills to our economy. That, of course, led to the first announcement in this sector to ensure that we had 180,000 fee-free TAFE places for 2023, and, as the Prime Minister just indicated, we've exceeded that target. It's now at 215,000 places and climbing. That is 215,000 Australians enrolled in courses in areas of skills demand. That is what is most critical. We understand that, because the states and territories have such an important role in the VET sector, you have to collaborate. You have to bring them together. </span>

If we're going to transform the energy sector, we need skills. If we're going to enliven manufacturing through the National Reconstruction Fund, we need skills. If we're going to supply the labour and skills for our care economy, we have to have the right investment, as advised by Jobs and Skills Australia. We'll continue to do more in ensuring that we supply skills to workers, students and businesses because, without doing that, we'll continue the failure by those opposite in leaving so many areas across our labour market in short supply.</span>

There's something else we've done to take pressure off inflation, and that is to turn around the $78 billion deficit that those opposite left and turn that into a $22 billion surplus.

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Dr CHALMERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:50</span>):  Thanks to the wonderful member for Werriwa for her question. Even as we campaigned in the referendum, even with everything that's going on around the world, this government has maintained a primary focus on jobs and wages and the cost of living, and the work that the skills minister has been doing with his state and territory colleagues and with the Prime Minister reflects that primary focus. The employment white paper that I released with a bunch of colleagues three weeks ago today reflects that primary focus as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The white paper and the work of the skills minister, the work of the Prime Minister and the work of the government are all about finding great jobs and great opportunities for more Australians and finding better trained workers for employers so that we can all prosper together. That's what the employment white paper was all about—helping Australians make the most of the big shifts underway in our economy and our society so that they can be beneficiaries and not victims of those changes. <span style="font-style:italic;">Working future</span>, which is the name of the white paper, presents a vision for a more dynamic and inclusive labour market where everyone has an opportunity for a job and where businesses and communities can be beneficiaries of change and can thrive. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We start this task from a strong position when it comes to the labour market. Since monthly records started being kept in 1978—a good year, Mr Speaker!—there have only been 18 months with an unemployment rate with a three in front of it, and 15 of those months have been under this Prime Minister. More than half a million jobs have been created under our government—a record for a new government in this country. It took those opposite more than three years to create more than half a million jobs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The white paper was about five things. It's about full employment, it's about job security and strong wages, it's about reigniting productivity growth after the failures of those opposite, it's about overcoming barriers to employment and broadening opportunity, and it's about building a skilled and adaptable workforce along the lines of the work of the Prime Minister and the skills minister over recent weeks and, indeed, over recent days as well. The white paper outlines not just what we're doing but what we intend to do, with 31 future reform directions and a bunch of new policies, including TAFE centres of excellence, the skills passport and more. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For those opposite, stagnant wages were a deliberate design feature of their approach to the economy. They oversaw the worst decade for productivity in the last half-century, and that's because they are long on nasty negativity but they are short on anything positive to say about the future of our economy, the future of our people or the future of our country. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things about this issue is that I have sought to grant agency to Indigenous Australians, to accept the invitation that they offered, that they worked through, that they had hundreds of meetings—involving thousands of people—about.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, the Voice, with constitutional recognition, was important. Makarrata is simply a Yolngu word for 'coming together after struggle'. I think it's a good thing that people come together, and I made it very clear on Saturday night that that is my position. I think that that is a reasonable thing to say and, in terms of where we go from here, I note that there has been a change of position again from the opposition when it comes to constitutional recognition. The Leader of the Opposition said during this process, in September:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">We went to the last election and a number of elections before that with that as our policy, and that will be our policy going into the next as well. I think it's right and respectful to recognise Indigenous Australians in the Constitution.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just think about that. They went to a number of elections with this as a promise. If only they'd been elected in 2016 and 2019, they might have fulfilled it!</span>

In January this year I asked former police chief commissioner Christine Nixon to undertake a rapid review into the exploitation of Australia's visa system. What this review found was utterly and truly shocking. Christine Nixon found that our migration system today has serious and systemic problems. She found that the system has been used to perpetrate some of the worst crimes that there are—sexual slavery, human trafficking—and that Australia, because of problems in our migration system, has actually become a target for organised crime around the world. Christine Nixon also found that the root causes of this problem were delay and dysfunction in our migration system and an almost complete lack of enforcement of the rules of that system. She said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">I have been appalled by the abuses of sexual exploitation, human trafficking and other organised crime that have been presented to me … It is clear that gaps and weaknesses in Australia's visa system are allowing this to happen.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We came to office with a migration system that was fundamentally broken and we don't have to look far to see the person who broke it. He's sitting opposite me in the Leader of the Opposition's chair. For almost all of the last decade the opposition leader oversaw our immigration system, first as Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and later as Minister for Home Affairs. What really makes me angry about these abuses and this exploitation is the fact that the opposition leader has styled himself as a tough man on borders. When we actually look at the facts, what he did was cut compliance officers in our department in half.</span>

                  </a>  It is not possible for anyone on the other side of politics to claim that they did not have great visibility of these problems. What we saw while they were in government was almost a report a year, including one done by one of the junior ministers in the portfolio during the time that they were in office, which detailed the different issues that Christine Nixon found in her report. Now, the evidence was there. The opposition leader did nothing. Instead, he cut funding and made the problem worse. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government has a very different approach. We take these issues extremely seriously. That is why just over a week ago we came forward with a comprehensive set of policies that will help the Australian government do a better job of doing this. What was the response from the opposition leader when we came forward with these policies? We didn't hear contrition. We didn't hear any taking of responsibility. What we heard instead was a bizarre array of the seven stages of grief. Then we heard that he was either being accused of being too tough or too soft. That's not what we're accusing you of, Leader of the Opposition. What we're accusing you of is incompetence.</span>

I do note, from the Leader of the Opposition, that he's spoken about it being a waste to have a referendum. There's a reason why the National Party perhaps have asked that rather than the Liberal Party, because the Leader of the Opposition committed during the recent referendum to hold another one. That's what he said. He stood up on multiple occasions—on 11 August, on 3 September, on 18 September—and said his plan, put out there for all to see, was he wanted people to vote no in this referendum, then to have an election in which he was successful and then to vote yes in another referendum. That's what he said, repeated times, before people voted. Before people voted on Saturday, he gave a solemn promise that he would support a second referendum being held.</span>

The last time there was a change in government, in December 2013, with this Leader of the Opposition as health minister, the first thing they did was cancel a $777 million national partnership agreement on closing the gap on Indigenous health. A $777 million closing the gap on Indigenous health national partnership agreement that was in place—ripped out as part of that budget. They then, in 2014, refused to provide ongoing funding for 38 Aboriginal children and family centres.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lilley</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Aged Care and Minister for Sport</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:05</span>):  I thank the member for Lalor for her question. I recently visited Manor Court Werribee Aged Care with the member for Lalor to talk with the aged-care workers and residents who live there—most of whom she could introduce herself, personally, such is her dedication as a local member—about the positive impact that our reforms in aged care are having on their day-to-day lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The election of the Albanese Labor government was a watershed and uniting moment for people who care about the state of aged care in this country. They were desperate to see it improved. Before the election older Australians were scared about the prospect of going into an aged-care home, with the royal commission exposing a shocking tale of neglect and incompetence. Workers were undervalued and underpaid. Labor heard these people, and we listened. We promised to build a better, fairer future for the aged-care sector and now we are delivering. We funded a meaningful pay rise for aged-care workers: a 15 per cent increase in the minimum award. Under the Albanese government, personal care workers are now taking home up to $141 a week more, or $7,300 a year more. Registered nurses are now taking home up to $196 a week more, which amounts to about $10,000 a year more. I have heard from workers who have related how that extra money means that they can now buy sports shoes for their kids and purchase long-needed hearing aids.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But stronger wages are not just helping our aged-care workers face the immense cost-of-living pressures; they are also leading to much better outcomes for the residents who they care for. I recently went for morning tea with the member for Higgins to Arcare Aged Care in Melbourne's east. There, one of the residents, Colleen, actually pulled me aside to tell me how much she respected and appreciated her nurse, Amanda. Colleen told me how good Amanda is at her job and how much happier she is now that Amanda has come to the aged-care sector and is caring for her. Maureen, from the Gold Coast, told me that her mum lives in aged care. She has noticed now that her mum is getting more one-to-one care because there are more workers on each shift that she is in there to see.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have data that shows that since the election of the Albanese Labor government older people in aged care are receiving an incredible additional 1.8 million minutes of care every single day. Let me state that again: 1.8 million additional care minutes every single day! The Albanese Labor government is delivering better outcomes for older people in aged care and for the very hardworking people that care for them.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the member for his question and I want to remind him of the strong new climate safeguard laws that we introduced on this side—that we negotiated with him and with others on the crossbench, and which this parliament passed some time ago—which say that coal and gas projects must comply with Australia's commitment to reaching net zero. We are approving more renewable energy projects than ever before. Just last week, our government approved the biggest battery project in Asia—one of the largest in the world. The week before that it was a massive new solar farm in Queensland that will produce enough power to power 200,000 homes—that's a city the size of Townsville. In fact, we have ticked off about 37 renewable energy projects since coming to government and we have about another 103 in the pipeline.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an enormous transformation of our energy sector. It is an enormous transformation, bigger than anything since the industrial revolution. I want to remind the member that you were part of designing this. Together we designed the safeguard mechanism. We voted for it, you voted for it, and we got it through the parliament because we are all committed to reaching—well, not all of us, sorry, but we are!—net zero. You want to do it, we want to do it, and that's why we are approving these renewable energy projects. It is also about, as well as our strong new climate laws, our target of net zero in law by 2050, our 43 per cent emissions reduction target by 2030, our 82 per cent renewable energy target by 2030. We've doubled renewable energy approvals. We've supported cheaper electric vehicles, higher fuel efficiency standards, massive upgrades to our energy transmission lines so that they can take the new solar, the new wind and the new hydro power. We've approved help for homes and businesses to get off gas and on to electricity and $2 billion for green hydrogen. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason we are doing all of this is that we know that we need to continue on a pathway to cheaper, cleaner renewable energy, powering homes and businesses. It is better for family budgets, it's better for the costs of businesses and, of course, it's also much better for the environment. </span>

He has a terrific record, after just 17 months as a local member, on delivering on the promises he made to his local community, particularly to strengthen Medicare and deliver cheaper medicines. In particular, the member for Hunter promised to reinstate the nation-leading after-hours GP service in the Hunter, and he along with his Hunter colleagues, the members for Paterson, Shortland and Newcastle, delivered it. He promised to reinstate the right of general practices to recruit overseas trained doctors, a right that had been stripped away by the former government, and he delivered on that promise as well. During the election campaign last May he stood with the Prime Minister and promised to deliver a Medicare urgent care clinic in Cessnock. Two weeks ago he was at the opening of that Medicare urgent care clinic, already making it easier to see a doctor in his area, already taking pressure off local emergency departments. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is one of 25 urgent care clinics around the country that are already up and running, and 58 will be up and running by the end of this calendar year. They're operating seven days a week on extended hours and are available for walk-ins by patients who need urgent care for non-life threatening emergencies. Of the 50,000 or so services already delivered by these clinics, around one-third have been delivered to kids under the age of15: kids who fall off their skateboard or get a deep cut and who otherwise would be sitting in the emergency department with their mums and dads for hour upon hour upon hour waiting for care. They're instead getting it quickly, and a third of the services have been delivered on the weekend, when it is just so difficult to get a GP, and, again people end up in the emergency department. Importantly, every one of the services up until now and from now will be fully free of charge, fully bulk-billed, because for Labor bulk-billing is the beating heart of Medicare. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm asked about neglect over the last decade. Australians who pay attention to health policy understand that the commitment to bulk-billing is not shared across this chamber. They remember when the Leader of the Opposition was the health minister. He said—and this is true—'There are too many free Medicare services'. They remember that he tried to abolish bulk-billing altogether and make every single Australian, every pensioner, every child, pay a fee for every single visit to the doctor. Then, when he couldn't get that through, he froze the Medicare rebate for six long years. Labor—the member for Hunter, everyone on this side—is committed to boosting bulling-billing, not abolishing it like the Leader of the Opposition tried to do.</span>

Now, we understand that inflation and interest rates were on the rise before we came to government, that the war in Ukraine has caused havoc on energy prices and that recent tensions in the Middle East have added to the uncertainty as well. Australians are not immune from these global factors. They feel the pinch every time they fill up at the bowser.</span>

                  </a>  For those opposite who are interjecting, I will tell them at least 10 different ways that we are helping to address the cost-of-living pressures in our economy. We are rolling out $23 billion in cost-of-living support targeted to where it's needed most—electricity bill relief, cheaper child care, increasing rent assistance, more Medicare bulk billing, cheaper medicines, boosting income support, fee-free TAFE training, building more affordable homes, expanding paid parental leave and getting wages moving again after a decade of wage stagnation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've done all of this at the same time as we've delivered the first budget surplus in 15 years. We've seen wages grow at their fastest rate in a decade and we've seen more than half a million jobs created in our economy, which is a record for a new government in this country. We are making vital investments in our people and in our economy. We are laying the foundations for the future, and our efforts to repair the budget are taking pressure off inflation when inflation is most problematic. We are working for Australia to help people with cost-of-living pressures, to get wages moving again, and our plan for $23 billion of cost-of-living relief makes that clear.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If those opposite really cared about cost-of-living pressures, they wouldn't have voted against our energy bill relief. If they really cared about cost-of-living pressures, they wouldn't have voted against more homes being built in our economy and our communities. If they really cared about cost-of-living pressures, they wouldn't have opposed the health minister's plans for cheaper medicines in our communities. As I said before, they are long on nasty negativity, but they are short on anything that even remotely resembles a positive plan for the future. We are getting on with the job of rolling out billions of dollars in cost-of-living relief and cleaning up the mess they left behind.</span>

He has a longstanding concern about water security issues and opportunities in that region, and I visited with the member for Kennedy on a number of occasions and looked at the Hughenden irrigation scheme. I reckon I've been to Hughenden more than anyone in this chamber except for the member for Kennedy, and that is because it is such a critical area for our future economy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a proposal that's been developed by HIPCo. The project would provide around 11,000 hectares of irrigated agricultural area; however, there are some steps that must be taken before it can be construction-ready. A sufficient water allocation must be obtained from the Queensland government, and Infrastructure Australia will need to assess the business case. The Queensland government wrote to us to consider funding for preconstruction activities, which I can tell the member for Kennedy we have now delivered. I will, of course, engage respectfully, as will the minister for infrastructure and, indeed, the minister for water, on this issue about the project and its associated infrastructure.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are spending some three-quarters of $1 billion on Queensland water infrastructure projects—Paradise Dam, near Bundi, in Queensland; Cairns Water Security State 1 Project; the Mount Morgan Water Supply project, strategic planning for improving water security in Queensland; additional funding towards Big Rocks Weir in Queensland and groundwater improvement and water efficiency in the lower Burdekin, in Queensland. In total, we're investing over $2 billion in water infrastructure. We are investing in the sorts of projects that the member for Kennedy has advocated for over a long period of time, and we're certainly investing in Queensland.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to continuing to work with the Palaszczuk government, including with my minister for infrastructure and minister for water, to make sure that we can make a difference—just as with the renewable energy projects I visited with the member for Kennedy, including, might I say, 'Big Kennedy' and 'Little Kennedy', which are not named after the member for Kennedy but are important projects nonetheless, as well as, of course, the Kidston Dam project and others as well. This is an important part of Australia that can certainly produce more. It produces a lot of wealth for this country, but there is an opportunity to expand further, and I look forward to working with the member for Kennedy to achieve that objective.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingston</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Social Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:25</span>):  I'd like to thank the member for Paterson for her question. Since coming to government, Labor has been working for the Australian people every single day. We know that many people are facing challenges with the cost of living, and that's why we've taken action to help relieve that pressure—it has been our top priority. In the May budget we announced our extensive cost-of-living plan to provide support to help millions of Australians doing it tough, but, of course, without adding to inflation. That support is now flowing and making a difference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my portfolio of social services, since the House last sat I'm pleased to advise that, from 20 September, we've seen many income support payments boosted, and they've started to flow to people's pockets. We have lifted payment rates for single parents, renters, older Australians and those who are unemployed or studying. For older Australians now eligible for the higher rate of JobSeeker, they've seen an increase of $109 a fortnight. For the 60,000 single parents who have moved from JobSeeker to the parenting payment as a result of this government's decision to expand access, they are now receiving at least an additional $197 a fortnight. And, of course, we've now introduced the largest increase in Commonwealth rental assistance in the last 30 years. For those on the base rate of JobSeeker, this has meant an increase of $56 a fortnight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer has aptly outlined all of those initiatives that those opposite have tried to block, but he did miss the fact that those opposite also tried to block the increase to the base rate of the JobSeeker, in the Senate. They wanted to deny those most vulnerable an increase to their base payment. This is just another example of the Leader of the Opposition always saying no. His endless negativity, if he were successful, would have denied support to those who need it the most.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we have a plan across government to ease the cost-of-living pressures. Our election commitment to expand eligibility to the Commonwealth seniors health card means that 20,500 more retirees have this card and have access to cheaper health care. We've delivered enhanced and more flexible paid parental leave—soon to legislate the scheme to 26 weeks. We've provided energy bill relief, reduced the cost of medicines and tripled bulk-billing incentives. It is our government that is firmly focused on cost-of-living pressures for Australians, and we will keep delivering.</span>

Adam Thomas, in recent times, has celebrated, since we last sat here, 25 years of service as the house manager at Kirribilli House in Sydney. That is an extraordinary effort by any means. When Adam went to begin work, he was clearly a very young man at Kirribilli House under John Howard, and he served John Howard for nine years. John Howard, of course, had Kirribilli House as his primary residence. That was followed by serving Kevin Rudd, Julia Gillard, Tony Abbott, Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison. Mr Howard, Mr Abbott and Mr Morrison had Kirribilli House as their primary residence. But Kirribilli House isn't just a residence; it is a national asset, as is the Lodge, and there we host many international visitors. Most recently, I hosted President Widodo there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been the case that prime ministers from John Howard through to myself have relied upon a fellow who is quite remarkable. He's very self-effacing. I spoke with the member for Cook about this a couple of weeks ago. I offered for Mr Thomas to come to Canberra to be here for this recognition, along with his family. It is typical of Adam that he is self-effacing and didn't want to be here—didn't want a fuss. He appreciated the acknowledgement but wanted to do it watching or listening, which is what he is doing back at Kirribilli House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He is responsible not just for cooking but for running the management and seeing people coming in and out. There are, of course, security issues that he has to deal with as well. We recently had an open day at Kirribilli House where 3,500 people attended on a Saturday. I know that he is the best of professional public servants as well. I can assure the member for Cook and other previous inhabitants of the prime ministership that he never tells a story out of school. He is someone who I know would have served Scott and his family just as he serves me. He is a remarkable public servant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a photo up in Kirribilli House of the kitchen from the 1950s, I think it is. It has not changed and he has to deal with all of that, but he does so with good humour. It often requires extraordinary hours. He is a great servant of Australia and I thank him. I also thank his lovely family; the nature of it means that quite often he's not home at dinner with them. He serves in a remarkable capacity and I thank him on behalf of myself but also—I think I can be so bold—on behalf of every prime minister from John Howard since, because I know that he has all of our respect and, indeed, our friendship and our thanks.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:33</span>):  I thank the Prime Minister for the opportunity to add my words to his, and I commend him for bringing this to the attention of the House. Public servants serve in many ways to serve our country, and Adam Thomas certainly is one of those. He has a very special responsibility, as the Prime Minister has set out. As a fine chef, he has cooked for the heads of state, prime ministers and secretaries of state that I was also able to host there at Kirribilli. The one thing Jenny and I are truly grateful to Adam for is that he understood that this was an important public residence, that it was an important part of the public estate and that it had many official purposes, but that it was also a home. Particularly, for Jenny and me and, of course, for Mr and Mrs Howard and Mr and Mrs Abbott, it was where we lived as families. Particularly for my young children at the time, who entered Kirribilli House as primary schoolgirls and left as teenagers, Adam and the staff at Kirribilli always made them feel very safe and very welcome in that place which became our home for that period of time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Adam, his wife, Kee-o, and his two now adult sons, we are very grateful for the sacrifices they made for us. They saw that very much as part of their service. I'm not surprised Adam wouldn't want to come and have all the fuss, but it is important that his service to our country is recognised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Given I'm saying thank you to Adam, it would be wrong of me not to take the opportunity at the same time to also thank Trina Barrie, who worked at the Lodge for many years and, unfortunately, wasn't able to continue on in that role after the last election. She served governors-general and prime ministers from both sides of the House. She and Adam, together, made an outstanding team, and I know Adam would join me in praising Trina's service as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you, Prime Minister, for bringing this to the attention of the House. The only thing I think Adam and I ever disagreed on was the football teams we followed. I thank him for the many cooking tips he gave me with my curries and for indulging me in regard to the mess that I often made in that kitchen. Thank you, Adam. God bless you and your family.</span>

There'll be some variation from the program that came out this morning. We will now move back to private members' business. There's about half an hour left of private members' business. This will occur. Following that, the government will bring forward the take note debate. There'll be 10-minute speeches on the take note debate for people who wanted to speak on the resolution this morning and felt they did haven't a chance because we wanted to bring it to a resolution prior to question time. That take note debate will continue through effectively to 7.30, except for the interruption at 5.30 for the suspension of standing orders.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:37</span>):  This is a very important motion. Shadow minister Ted O'Brien is not present because he has had a baby. I wish him and his family all the best.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Industrial-scale renewable projects are being rolled out across the country in a reckless and haphazard manner, upsetting so many people, mainly electricity customers whose bills keep going up all the time. The last default market offer went up 20 to 30 per cent across the east coast market. Input tariffs for their solar panels are going down. Lots of large industrial companies, particularly in my electorate, want to expand, but they can't get enough energy. The network providers can't give them any more. Many other businesses have already offshored their businesses because the cost of electricity is too great.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is due to increasing amounts of variable renewable energy on an industrial scale. People are only accepting it because the Minister for Climate Change and Energy keeps saying that renewables are the cheapest form of energy. He uses the levelised cost of energy to justify that. But just so you can be clear, Madam Deputy Speaker Claydon, the levelised cost of energy is not a good measure of the cost of electricity. It is a standalone cost at the bottom of a wind tower or at the bottom of a solar panel. It's not the cost of delivered electricity to your power plug. That is a complex, additional set of costs which goes up exponentially. Because renewable energies are so dilute and so variable, you have to overexpand across pristine bushland and pristine, high-quality farmland, and it's destroying the value of those lands. It's actually turning good grazing country into industrial parks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Offshore wind development at Port Stephens, Newcastle and up into the Myall lakes will put at risk huge fishing grounds, national marine parks and New South Wales state marine parks—all those environmental gems of Australia. There are Ramsar protected islands and wetlands. The birds and marine life that inhabit those areas will have almost 1,900 square kilometres of industrial wind farms that are uneconomical. They use huge material intensity. They only have a life of maybe 20 years unless you have an east coast low, when something that's 261 metres tall will probably get blown over and drift. All these extra costs are never mentioned. Levelised cost of energy is a poor measure. What you should have is the all-up, delivered cost of energy as your comparisons.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, the GenCost report is the generator of this information. The whole policy of the government relies on it. But the GenCost report and the subsequent integrated system plan that relies on it have been criticised. CSIRO and AEMO have both received extensive correspondence from well-known economists and power grid specialists, who have identified this, and they have been ignored. David Carland did a report for the Energy Policy Institute identifying what CSIRO calls 'sunk costs'. That money that's already been spent. Trust me: Snowy Hydro has partly been paid, but all the grids and the 15 gigawatts of extra storage haven't been paid for. Battery of the Nation hasn't been paid for. They're all the upfront costs of relying on so much renewable energy, let alone all the frequency control and auxiliary services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the wind farm off Port Stephens there's a $1 billion fishing industry. There's a blue-water economy with whale watching. There are 10,000 whales that migrate up and down the east coast of Australia. Their acoustics will be blown out of the water, literally, by all the acoustic testing and drilling. Renewable energy is cheap if you can get it, but all the grid costs, all the land-use costs and all the environmental destruction just get a leave pass.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to stop this madness now, maintain our coal plants and consider clean, zero-carbon, nuclear energy, which has none of those problems.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:42</span>):  In essence, this motion begs the simple question: what on earth was the coalition doing for a decade in government and, frankly, what on earth is it doing now? Every item of complaint in this motion points directly to an absolute failure by the previous government to take responsibility for Australia's affordable, secure, zero-carbon energy future. In three terms and through three Prime Ministers they couldn't even achieve a national energy policy. Over the course of a decade, they saw the total amount of generation capacity in Australia actually go down. Over the course of a decade, they neglected to do anything about Australia's awful and dangerous level of liquid fuel insecurity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion specifically asks about the integration of Snowy 2.0 and the Kurri Kurri system, both initiated by the coalition, and yet for a decade they did nothing to adapt and improve Australia's energy network for the inevitable transformation that would occur. Now they're back to playing a few of their old favourite games: climate change denialism, fearmongering when it comes to renewable energy and that old chestnut that we heard right at the end there, the fantasy that never arrives: so-called next-generation nuclear power.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is picking up the pieces in the aftermath of an extraordinary mess, and we're not going to be dragged down the low road of denialism, fearmongering and fantasy. In fewer than 18 months, the Minister for Climate Change and Energy has worked steadily to get Australia back on track at a time when our global and regional competitors are making rapid progress towards the necessary and inevitable energy transformation. The work we've already undertaken, which includes supporting investment in renewables, storage, wind power, hydrogen, a 21st-century upgrade of our energy grid and the delivery of Australia's first national EV strategy, is creating jobs. It's helping to stabilise power prices for households and businesses at a time of global energy shocks. It's supercharging the appetite for innovation and entrepreneurship that is key to our social and economic future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've already seen the effects of that good work. This is what AEMO had to say in April, inside the first year of the Albanese Labor government: </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Renewable energy is driving down the wholesale cost of energy, setting new records for minimum demand for electricity from the grid and driving emissions to record lows …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report also shows that new and recently commissioned grid-scale solar and wind units increased generation in the NEM this quarter by an average of 330 megawatts and 134 megawatts respectively, yielding a record quarterly average of 4,654 megawatts, which was 11 per cent higher than in quarter 1, 2022. That is what happens when you have a government that takes seriously its responsibility to work for and deliver for the Australian people—more power, more zero-emissions power and cheaper power. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the CSIRO's GenCost analysis, it's interesting that, in the motion, the member for Fairfax makes no mention of nuclear power costs. He and I were part of the committee inquiry in 2019, as was the member for Lyne, that looked at the viability of a nuclear power industry in Australia, and the clearest evidence was that no economic case could be made for such an industry. In fact, Ziggy Switkowski, who'd conducted the same inquiry for the Howard government in 2006, said the case against nuclear had gotten stronger in the meantime. Coalition members of the inquiry took issue with the CSIRO GenCost assessment of the likely costs of yet-to-exist small modular reactors. The predictions in relation to the NuScale project in the US were cited as evidence that SMRs would soon deliver cheap electricity. On that basis alone, some coalition members were adamant that the GenCost numbers were wrong and perhaps represented some kind of technocratic bias. Well, how about some facts? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in 2019 NuScale claimed it would deliver a 720-megawatt plant in 2024 for $8 billion. Earlier this year the company provided a market update. The project's generation capacity has been reduced by a third. The latest estimate is for the project to come online in 2029 at a cost of $14 billion—in other words, a third less power, a five-year delay and double the cost. In relation to NuScale's brush with reality, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis observed:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… no one should fool themselves into believing this will be the last cost increase for the NuScale/UAMPS SMR.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese-Labor government will not be distracted by the ideological flim-flam from the nuclear white shoe brigade and their devotees in the coalition. We'll continue to take on the serious work of supporting Australia's shift towards cheaper and cleaner energy, ensuring we don't get left behind in terms of jobs, investment and innovation at a time of global energy transformation, while improving our energy security at the same time. That's what Australians voted for and that's what we are delivering.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:47</span>):  Most Australians will be shocked at the discovery of the $60 billion black hole in the middle of the Albanese government's 2030 renewable energy plan! CSIRO's own chief economist acknowledges that all existing generation storage and transmission capacity up to 2030 is not factored into the costs. But those costs will have to be paid for by energy bill payers. Those so-called sunk costs will be very real to the families and businesses who will see them on their energy bills. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The GenCost study that Labor has relied on to cost its energy plan somehow magically neglects to include the massive costs of storage and transmission, including Snowy 2.0, the Kurri Kurri gas plant, significant integrated system plan transmission projects, the Tasmania Battery of the Nation and the Illawarra gas peaking plant. Also omitted are the enormous grid-wide costs of integrating homes into the new renewables network, including household batteries and solar panels. It beggars belief. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It needs to be said loud and clear that the government has been misleading Australians by misrepresenting the true cost of its energy plan. We cannot allow this dissembling to go on unchallenged. The government and the minister must come clean with the Australian people about how much they are going to have to pay in the mad rush to meet their 43 per cent emissions reduction target, their 82 per cent renewable energy target and the impact of the carbon tax by 2030. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government must stop cooking the books and instead adopt the approach of the coalition. We advocate for an all-of-the-above strategy when it comes to energy. This approach acknowledges the necessity of considering a mix of different technologies, including renewables, to meet our energy needs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor, on the other hand, have gone all-in on renewables only, and the energy users of this country will have to pay for it. The massive transmission networks they plan to build to deliver the renewable energy to market—including the hulking VNI West transmission route, right through the middle of my electorate of Mallee—are not included in their calculations, and yet reports cost AEMO's extended option 5A plan at a mere $11 billion during the construction phase alone. That will have to be paid for, again, through family energy bills. And that doesn't include the huge social, environmental and personal costs that communities in the path of the transmission lines and in the shadow of windfarms will have to pay. I have been consulting with countless people in the Mallee on these issues for months, and it's fair to say that most of them are distraught. They will see their prime agricultural land ripped up as transmission lines are bulldozed through. Prime wetlands will be destroyed, the environment irrevocably changed and endangered species threatened. And Labor's response to all of this is to plough on regardless, with little attempt to secure the social licence they promised to deliver. So often it is regional communities that pay the price for Labor's metrocentric policies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If Labor weren't so ideologically blinkered, they might see the benefit of the all-of-the-above option that we in the coalition are advocating for. We need a properly balanced energy mix which includes robust baseload power delivery. We have already seen in Germany and elsewhere what happens when an energy grid is too heavily dependent on renewables—what happens when the sun isn't shining and the wind isn't blowing: the lights go out, that's what happens. That's why the Nationals have long been advocating for a proper review of nuclear energy. Nuclear energy is used by more than 30 countries around the world, including the US, Canada and the UK. That's despite the fact that Labor keep talking about it, literally, as, 'There is nothing to see here,' with new projects and small modular reactors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Ontario, for example, nuclear comprises about 60 per set of its grid and energy bills are half the cost of Australia's. That surely tells us everything we need to know. I call on the Labor government to be honest with the Australian people about the true cost of their renewable energy plan, and I call on the minister to consider all available energy generation options. It is not fair that families and businesses, particularly in the regions, will have to fork out to pay for this ill-considered policy.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:52</span>):  This motion by the member for Fairfax highlights, once again, the vacuum in energy policy that still exists amongst the coalition. As the member for Fremantle quite rightly pointed out, the opposition were in government for nearly a decade. They were in government at a time when we knew the country had to transition away from fossil fuels. They knew that there was a number of coal-fired power stations that were destined to close and they knew that we had to meet emissions reduction targets, and yet they could not land a single energy policy throughout all of that time. Indeed, we knew when they were in office that we were heading for energy price rises to the extent that just before the 2022 election—as we now know—there was a report given to them which outlined that energy prices would go on to rise. And yet they hid that from the public in order to try to camouflage the issue of energy prices as we went into the election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Albanese government was elected and we did indeed start to look at what we could do to try and manage rising energy prices, we capped coal and gas prices. What did those on the other side do? They opposed those very initiatives which went straight to the heart of trying to put a lid on rising energy prices. Indeed, those initiatives have made a real difference. What we're seeing now is a coalition that is simply using this kind of motion as nothing more than a political campaign tool. They don't have any answer, and if members bothered to read this 11-part motion they'd see there is nothing within it that articulates what the coalition would do if they were in government. In fact, part 2, which is the only part that refers to any such thing, says that a complete assessment be done to determine 'the true optimum investment pathway for Australia's energy market' and that 'all of the above'—what is the above? There is nothing in the first nine parts of the motion they refer to—be considered as part of a future energy plan. It's all about the consideration with no specific proposal. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want to criticise Labor's proposals that we currently have before the Australian people, by all means do that. But at least have the decency to put up what the alternative is. We know from comments made by others that their response to date has simply been that we should look to small modular nuclear reactors. The reality is that throughout the world I understand that there are only two such reactors, one which is a demonstration unit in China and the other which is on a barge in Russia. In other words, if they were going to work and were the true alternative, why aren't they in use everywhere else? Even if they were the alternative, we know full well that they're a decade away. People need a response, and they need a policy right now. In fact, they needed it 10 years ago, when the coalition government first took office. They can't wait 10 years, and, if we did go down that path, the reality is that it would cost some 18 times more than the renewable energy pathway that the Albanese government is on. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those figures don't come from some airy-fairy person, such as, again, the motion talks about. It talks about an independent analysis from a leading Australian energy economist. They don't name who that person or company doing the independent analysis is, which begs the question: why not? The response to the Albanese Labor government comes from a report done by AEMO and CSIRO. It's okay to rely on the true experts in this country when it suits the argument, but then, when it does not suit your argument, you dismiss them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is indeed getting on with trying to do something about the energy costs in this nation. We have the Rewiring the Nation project and plan that is already under way. We are encouraging and supporting renewable energy investments, as we heard today in question time from the Minister for the Environment and Water who outlined some of those major projects where investments are being made. We are also providing energy rebates to the most vulnerable. Fixing the energy crisis is a priority of this government. It is not going to be easy, especially when it has been neglected for nearly a decade, but this government is getting on with the job of doing just that. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By introducing this private member's bill today I seek to implement one of the government's own promises: their commitment to expand the water trigger in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The water trigger is the mechanism in the act which requires that projects likely to have a significant impact on water resources come before the federal environment minister for approval. However, as it currently stands the water trigger only applies to coal seam gas and large coalmining developments. The government's commitment to expanding the water trigger to encompass all types of unconventional gas, including shale and tight gas, was documented in their Nature Positive Plan released in December 2022. This is precisely what I am proposing with my private member's bill today, nothing more and nothing less.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason I am introducing my private member's bill today is that time is running out for the government to implement this urgently, and this urgently needed amendment to the water trigger. A Senate inquiry into oil and gas exploration and production in the Beetaloo basin handed down its report in April this year. It recommended that the expanded water trigger be operational by 31 December 2023. That deadline is less than 2½ months, and three parliamentary sitting weeks, away. It is a matter of urgency that the water trigger be expanded now, as multiple shale gas fracking projects in the NT are due to be approved imminently.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In further context, the Northern Territory government placed a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing in September 2016 amid concerns that this drilling method could harm the environment and water resources. Following this, the scientific inquiry into hydraulic fracturing in the Northern Territory, otherwise known as the Pepper inquiry, was established to assess the risks of fracking in the Northern Territory. The final report of the Pepper inquiry was released in March 2018 and provided the NT government with 138 recommendations to mitigate the risks of fracking in the Northern Territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Northern Territory government accepted the inquiry's findings and lifted the moratorium on the basis that it would implement all recommendations by the end of 2022. Of greater significance to this private member's bill, the Pepper inquiry concluded that there should be a water trigger in the EPBC Act which applies to all onshore gas activities and requires the federal environment minister's approval for those activities likely to have significant impact on water resources. No such water trigger has been enacted, yet this recommendation is marked as complete on the Northern Territory government's website.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, in October 2020 Professor Graeme Samuel AC submitted his independent review into the EPBC Act 1999. His review concluded that the EPBC Act, Australia's central piece of national environmental law, is outdated, ineffective and requires fundamental reform. In the foreword of the Nature Positive Plan, the environment minister stated, 'When read alongside the 2021 State of the Environment report, Professor Samuel's reports presents us with an alarming story of an environment in decline. The equation facing Australia is simple: if our laws don't change, our trajectory of environmental decline will not change either. The prospect of accelerating decline should alarm us all.' As Professor Samuel's review makes clear, if we want to ensure that our exceptional natural heritage is there for future generations, we must act seriously and we must act now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two key reasons why this change to the water trigger must be made urgently ahead of the broader EPBC Act reforms. One is the looming threat of more frequent and severe droughts in the future because of climate change. Earlier this month the Bureau of Meteorology declared Australia is again facing an El Nino event. Australia's severe droughts in recent decades have all been associated with El Nino conditions. September was the driest September on record in Australia since 1900. Hydraulic fracturing to extract gas uses enormous amounts of water. It is not acceptable that these projects can be proved without an assessment of how they will impact our precious water resources and the flow-on effects to communities, farmers and the environment, both now and in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second key reason for the urgency is that, in May this year, the Northern Territory government announced it would allow fracking to commence in the Territory. The granting of gas production licences is imminent for a number of fracking projects in the NT, including Tamboran's projects in the Beetaloo Basin and Black Mountain oil and gas projects in the Kimberley. Tamboran Resources has publicly stated it intends to start producing gas from fracking operations as soon as next year. Australians, particularly those living in affected communities, do not deserve to hear once again that the government was right to approve yet more environmentally damaging projects because they did not contravene our national environment laws. That is especially when the government itself has acknowledged that those laws are broken and must be urgently amended but has as yet failed to do so. Traditional owners and pastoralists in the Northern Territory support the urgent expansion of the water trigger. Ray Dimakarri Dixon, a Mudburra elder in the Marlinja community said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Land is our life. Water is our life. We've got nowhere else to go. This is destroying our land and our culture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Is it time to listen? I also caution the government not to hand over future approvals and scientific assessments under the EPBC Act to states and territories who are likely to favour developments which they profit from over the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill I'm introducing today does no more and no less than what the government has already said it should do. It is a discreet part of the EPBC Act that can be amended and passed prior to the more comprehensive reform of the act. It has broad support from the crossbench in both this place and the other place. It is my sincere hope that the government will keep its promise to expand the water trigger by supporting this bill and passing it urgently in this House by the end of the year. I'll now cede the rest of my time to the member for Warringah.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STEGGALL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  I rise to second and speak in support of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Expanding The Water Trigger) Bill 2023 from the member for Mackellar, to expand the definition of the water trigger in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. This bill is simple. It expands the water trigger to provide federal oversight of the impact that many fossil fuel mining projects will have on Australia's precious water resources. The government has noted its intention to do just this and expand the definition of the water trigger to cover all forms of unconventional gas. This is consistent with the expert advice from the Pepper inquiry and the Samuel review. So no-one seems to be in any disagreement about expanding the water trigger. The question is time—time is of the essence. The upcoming summer is going to be very hot and has the potential to be as disastrous as the 2019-2020 Black Summer bushfires around this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year, the <span style="font-style:italic;">T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">urning the tide</span> report found that the world faces the prospect of a 40 per cent shortfall in freshwater supply by as soon as 2030. So, I repeat, time is of the essence. The minister for the environment needs to act on the election promise to amend the water trigger now. This will put great pressure on water resources. The proposed fracking and use of water without federal oversight and review will really put at risk access to water. This is a precious resource. We cannot have gas fracking projects coming before water for communities. Constituents in Warringah want rapid action to mitigate and prepare for climate change impacts. This includes properly assessing projects that may have a detrimental impact to central resources for communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Access to clean water is an essential human right and one that we must ensure is protected in Australia. The government has made many promises coming into power but is failing to deliver on them when it comes to protecting the environment. I urge the government to support this bill and simply get on with the job that they've already committed to do. There is immediate need, and, after the referendum, where we saw Indigenous communities overwhelmingly vote in support of the Voice and being heard, there is an opportunity now for the Albanese government to put in place practical listening. You need to listen to these remote communities, these Indigenous communities, who want their voices and their concerns heard when it comes to the use of water, their right to clean water and the importance it plays for them in their culture and in protecting the environment. So to the government and to the minister for the environment: please protect their environment above the rights of fossil fuel projects. Hear their plea and amend the water trigger by supporting this bill.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:10</span>):  Running through the dirt and dust to try to find refuge from rockets and guns, the young Israelis who, moments before, were enjoying a festival, were suddenly trying to take refuge in a horrible, murderous situation. They were just out to enjoy themselves. Then they were watching their friends die before their eyes, some being kidnapped. There are harrowing stories of playing dead to avoid being killed. These stories will never leave our hearts, and they should never leave our minds. There are stories of children and babies being shielded by their parents, of women being raped and dragged naked through the streets—the horrors of what Hamas did to innocent Israelis. It's abhorrent, it's inhumane and it's evil. These actions should be condemned by everyone in this country and, surely, in this House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hamas do not want peace. They are a terrorist organisation that seeks to end Israel. We must show our utmost support for Israel in their darkest times. I rise to support the motion moved by the Prime Minister this morning and the opposition leader's comments on the atrocious conflict caused by many Hamas militants and inflicted on innocent Israelis. The breaching of security barriers by Hamas and the ongoing slew of rockets from Gaza happened on a Jewish holiday. Professional footage by Hamas that was distributed to the world as a badge of pride for their barbarism is sickening to watch. We are still in shock and despair that we see ourselves in the midst of yet another attack on Israel, which is an attack on the Jewish community across the world. I know the Jewish community in my electorate of Lindsay is really hurting right now. It is incumbent on all of us in this House to support the State of Israel and to ensure it lives on forever. As a multicultural and multifaith nation, Australia seeks to ensure a safe and harmonious place for everyone across the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The handling of the protest last week at the Opera House was a disgrace. The individuals who protested in an undignified way caused distress to Sydney's Jewish community, who wanted to safely attend the Opera House to see the Israeli flag and to pray for their families who are in Israel. In this conflict, we recognise the civilians who are casualties on both sides of this war. Hamas's attack on innocent civilians was a direct and blatant provocation. Israel has a right to self-defence. Israel has a right to deter acts of aggression, coercion and interference. We are now seeing strategic operations being undertaken so that future attacks on Israel and its people do not occur.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to remember that Hamas entered Israel and has taken over 100 hostages. They killed hundreds of young people who were attending a music festival for peace, caused destruction, murdered thousands and caused chaos. Think of the mass destruction of Israel that could have taken place were it not for the Iron Dome defence system and the United States's financial and moral support for that system to ensure the Jewish community and its state are protected. America acutely understands what happened to Israel, given what happened on 9/11. At that time, as those planes terribly crashed into the towers and into the Pentagon, America then had the right to unequivocally defend itself. Likewise, I reiterate that now Israel has that same right too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Should Israel request particular support, we need to ensure that countries oblige in order to enhance defence measures for the State of Israel and its citizens, such as ammunitions and specialist support. It is what we would expect from the international community. It is what we have done recently for Ukraine in its struggle against Russia. We know that around 10,000 Australians are currently in Israel, and we want them to be home and to be safe. It is right that the government works swiftly to encourage and arrange repatriation flights for our citizens in the conflict zone who wish to return to Australia. There is precedent for this from previous governments, and we need this support to continue for as long as it is possible and for as long as it is needed.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="008CH" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms DANIEL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:15</span>):  Firstly, I want to acknowledge the deep distress and anxiety among those in the large Jewish community in Goldstein. Everyone I've spoken to from within our Jewish community has a connection to family or friends directly affected by the Hamas terror attacks on Israel the week before last. There are a range of views in the community about what Israel's response should be, but the sense of distress about what happened and what happens next is uniform.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me be clear: Hamas is a terrorist organisation. The atrocities it committed in Israel are war crimes, including the horrific and indiscriminate slaughter of entire Jewish communities. The taking of hostages, elderly civilians as well as children and infants, is a breach of international law. Hamas should release them without conditions immediately. I've also communicated to Palestinian advocates in Australia that applauding the deaths of innocent people is abhorrent and will derail any hope for a return to peace, and I condemn it. The Israeli people have a right to live in safety and security, and Israel has a right to self-defence. However, that response must be carefully calibrated with the safety of civilians front of mind and within the dictates of international law, the laws of war, and in line with international conventions on human rights.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've already appealed for Israel to reconsider its decision to block humanitarian supplies to Gaza, a form of collective punishment, which appears to be in breach of international law. Calls for a humanitarian corridor are backed by the UN and the United States. The rules of war are clear: one inhumane act does not justify another, and the safety of civilians is paramount. I'm pleased that, in a sign of humanitarian concern, Israel has decided to restore some water supplies to southern Gaza. I'm aware that for many Jewish people these acts of humanitarianism will require unprecedented empathy considering the horrors that Hamas has committed. I will also say again: Palestinian civilians are not Hamas. I am appalled at reports that Hamas has encouraged Palestinian civilians in Gaza to stay put in the north. This is tantamount to Hamas turning the people of Gaza into human shields. It is mediaeval in the contempt for human life, as is the holding of Israeli hostages, including small children and the elderly, also being used as human shields.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a foreign correspondent, I reported from trouble spots around the world, wherever possible drawing attention to human rights. I've continued to do so as an MP. The reality is that actions in times of war disproportionally affect civilians and, in this case, if not carefully executed, will and are causing untold death and destruction, potentially not only in Gaza and again in Israel but across a region that is always on a knife edge. This is a clear and present danger.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have seen the results of conflict—the destruction, people missing limbs, bodies wrapped in shrouds, the grief of those left behind, the squalid camps full of the displaced and the traumatised. I speak with sincerity from the dark places where I hide these memories, with genuine concern for all people, and I grieve deeply for those affected in my own community, touched by the terror that has reached from Israel to Goldstein. My want is for that to end here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note, too, the impact on children, who are being exposed to these brutal events on social media, with algorithms feeding them videos that no-one should see. I've raised this with the communications minister and I welcome the efforts of the eSafety Commissioner, who has reminded the digital platforms that they have a legal responsibility to remove such content—content which I know our children, my teenagers among them, are inadvertently being exposed to as they seek to understand what is happening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I appreciate the efforts of the foreign minister in trying to assure those who want to leave that they have a way of getting out of Israel, and of her staff in addressing my representations on behalf of those in my community who have loved ones who are stranded, including children who are on gap years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know from my experience of reporting from around the world—from Africa, Asia and the Americas—that information is everything. I appeal to the government to make updates to information on the situation in Israel and the Palestinian territories as timely as possible. It is also profoundly important to step people who've never been in such dire circumstances before through the processes for registration for exit, and for their safety in the meantime.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many in the Jewish community in Goldstein feel anxious and have concerns for their safety at the best of times, and these are far from the best of times. It was not so long ago, within the last few months, that a group of Jewish school students on a bus on their way home were threatened with a knife and subject to antisemitic abuse. Now students are being advised not to wear their uniforms and police have stepped up visibility and patrols around Jewish institutions. Some schools are said to be considering a return to remote learning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank Victoria Police for their engagement with me and my office—close engagement that will continue, because we must keep our community safe. There is no room for either antisemitism or Islamophobia. I welcome the government's announcement that security grants will be fast-tracked. I know that will be gratefully received in my community. I've spoken to major Jewish organisations within Goldstein and nationally. In the last week I've attended gatherings to mourn the worst loss of life in Israel since its establishment seven decades ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that Australia was instrumental in its foundation, with then foreign minister Doc Evatt taking the lead as chair of the relevant United Nations committee, leading to its international acknowledgement. Doc Evatt was President of the General Assembly when resolution 273 was adopted, admitting Israel to the UN. Australia was the first nation to vote in favour. He was President when the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted and when the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide was passed. So Australia had a big part to play in the establishment both of Israel and of the international rules designed to make the world a safer place after World War II and the unparalleled horrors of the Holocaust. This international order stands and must be adhered to by all sides today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently had the honour of visiting Israel and the Palestinian territories as a member of a cross-party official parliamentary delegation funded by the Australian government. My visit reinforced my view that only genuine dialogue can create progress and peace. But, even then, that dialogue seemed further off than ever, amid a leadership void in the Palestinian territories and an understandable sense of fatigue and frustration in Israel. I remain a supporter of a two-state solution as the best way to ensure Israelis and Palestinians can live in peace and security. How we get there from here, though, is a question with no obvious answer. Australia remains committed to multilateralism, and we must make our best effort with all those with influence in the Middle East to bring the protagonists back from the brink of war and to the negotiating table.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, every member of the 15,000-strong Jewish community in Goldstein has been touched by the tragic events of the last week. I say to those in my community: I know you are not a homogenous group; I know you have differing views; I know some of you will disagree with my positions in one way or the other. But know this: as someone who has borne witness to the horrors of conflict and terrorism, I speak from a position of deeply sincere care and I will represent you, particularly to ensure you get what you need from the government in these shocking circumstances, with absolute diligence and sincerity.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms O'NEIL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hotham</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Cyber Security</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:24</span>):  I thank the parliament for the opportunity to make some remarks on what has been the extraordinary and shocking level of violence that we saw inflicted on innocent men, women and children 10 days ago in Israel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I cannot express strongly enough how powerfully our government condemns the violence that has led to the unnecessary deaths of men, women and children in Israel. This is a terrorist attack which is profoundly wrong and inhuman, and the vile way in which innocent people, who have no role in a conflict, were treated is just beyond belief. What we saw was a bunch of incidents which echo the darkest days of modern history. I won't go into the gory detail of some of what was perpetrated because the parliament doesn't need to, again, hear about what have been horrendous crimes committed against Israeli people and against humanity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's really important that we acknowledge that there are people in our community and even people in our parliament who are having a deeply personal experience of what has occurred over recent days. I want to acknowledge the Attorney-General, Mark Dreyfus, the son of a Holocaust survivor. I want to acknowledge Josh Burns, my dear friend, the member for Macnamara, and the representative of what I presume to be the largest Australian Jewish community in our country. I want to acknowledge Mike Freelander, a Jewish Australian and someone who is a fierce advocate for his local community in Western Sydney. Like most Jewish Australians, they feel what has happened here so deeply and so keenly. To see people attacked for their religion is a horrible and terrifying thing but particularly for this community and particularly given the history. I want to thank those three people in particular for the leadership that they've shown and for the advice that they've given me over recent days about how to handle this matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our local Jewish community is feeling this incredibly keenly. I was really pleased to join with people from across this parliament to attend a vigil last Friday night with the Jewish Australian community in Caulfield. This is a community that is extremely tender, fearful and anxious. What they did last Friday night was give an expression of their spirituality, religion and community and gathered together to grieve in a public place. This was not an easy thing for some people in that community to do and it showed great courage and bravery. It was my privilege to be there, to stand alongside them, as they grieved for the loss of what's occurred.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to speak briefly to the fear and anxiety that I know is being felt, in particular in Jewish Australian communities at the moment, and to say as home affairs minister: 'I hear those concerns and anxieties.' I've sat with people in recent days who have told me that they're too afraid to send their children to their Jewish school, that there are young people who will not put on their Jewish school uniform at the moment because they are so fearful of antisemitism, of violence and attacks. I want the community to understand that I hear that message.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want you to know something that's been expressed really clearly to me by our national security officials in this country, and that is that there is nothing to suggest that we need to change the terror threat level at the moment in our country. Our terror threat level was at 'possible' two weeks ago. It is still at 'possible' today. The analysis has been conducted specifically with reference to the Jewish Australian community, and the answer is the same: the terror threat level remains at 'possible'. Our agencies are amazing. They are full of the most clever, thoughtful people that I've ever come across in my life, but they're not all-seeing and all-knowing, so I'm not saying that nothing bad can, or will, happen here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what I want you to know is that despite that lack of change to our terror threat level, what has changed is the extent of vigilance, activity and care that is being taken to address national security concerns as of today. That's being driven by the general sense of understanding amongst our national security apparatus here in the federal government and at the state level about how scared people are right now. I want you to know that we are very well-served in our country by mature arrangements around counterviolence and counterterrorism across the Commonwealth and the states and that we have some very, very experienced, very clever people who are working at the moment, throughout the weekend, throughout the night, to try to do everything they can to keep our country safe. I know I speak for everyone in the parliament when I express my deep gratitude to the people who come to work every day with the sole purpose of trying to protect their fellow Australians and their fellow citizens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to address, specifically, the evil of Hamas in what is an act of unbelievable violence which will only beget more violence and only hurt the people that Hamas pretends to represent. Hamas is of course a listed terrorist organisation in Australia. They have committed heinous, inhuman, disgusting crimes against Israelis. They have also committed disgraceful crimes against Palestinians. They have done that because they have now retreated back into Gaza and are using innocent people who live in Gaza as human shields. I was just disgusted to see, with the Israeli government having indicated that people should evacuate northern Gaza, that Hamas is sending a message to not evacuate. If we had any question about the sort of people that we are dealing with, then that says it all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that Gaza is a densely populated place, about half the size of Canberra, where two million people live. We know that this is a population of people who are young. A very large share of the population there are children, and what Hamas have done is put those people in danger. That is a disgraceful, disgusting betrayal—violence begetting more violence. What Hamas have also done is set back the cause of peace and statehood for Palestinians; they've set it back a long way. There are legitimate aspirations that Palestinians have for their own state. We are far further away from that than we were 10 days ago, and Hamas is responsible for that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are people across our country who are going to feel very deeply about what has occurred in the Middle East and what will occur in the Middle East. I've spoken about Jewish Australians, but let me address some comments for Muslim Australians and people of Middle Eastern heritage for whom deaths in Gaza are going to be felt just as personally, just as deeply and with as much grief as Israelis feel about the deaths of people in their country. I want communities across this country to know that the Australian government stands with communities when they are grieving the innocent loss of life. There is more loss of life to come, and I say that with a heavy heart. I'm here next to my friend the Minister for Aged Care and Minister for Sport, and we've both got young children. I know we'll keep our children away from the television for the next few months because what is to come is something that no child should have to witness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are very lucky in our country to live in a beautiful multicultural country. There's no God-given reason why our country should work and be so prosperous, cohesive and beautiful in the way that it does function. I think about my community, where people who come from countries which have been at war for many years now live alongside me as neighbours and friends whose children go to school together, whose kids play sport together and whose parents have tea together. That is a beautiful thing. It is a beautiful thing about our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we have important obligations to think about what we can do for each other as Australians to protect and defend the social fabric which underpins this. I'd say to every member of parliament that it starts with the people in this room. As parliamentarians, we are a microcosm of our nation. We have different religions, different backgrounds, different spiritualities and different life experiences here in this parliament, and the Australian people are looking to us at the moment to consider how they should handle what is going on around the world. I'd say to parliamentarians that we can do ourselves and our nation a great service by treating each other with dignity, respect, honesty, care and love. They're looking to us for cues about how to manage this issue, and I think that if we behave well towards one another then we're doing a great thing for our country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:33</span>):  I rise in support of the motion. The last 10 days have been a terrible, dark time not only for the people of Israel but for millions of people around the world who are in mourning and in shock. The terrorist attacks by Hamas on Israeli citizens and civilians is the worst and most brutal atrocity experienced by Jewish people since the Shoa. More than 1,300 Israelis have died, and 3½ thousand have been wounded. Every single family in Israel has been touched by this tragedy. Scores of people are still hostages: children, women and grandparents. In the words of a Holocaust prayer:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish I had time to read all the names of the dead, to properly pay my respects and pray for them and their families. Instead, I will share the names of some of those who perished. Shani Louk, who was 30 years old, was one of the over 260 people at the Nova music festival who were mercilessly murdered. Tamar and Yonatan Kedem and their twin daughters, Shahar and Arbel, who were six, and their son, Ohmer, who was four, fled to their safe room when the attacks began but were murdered by Hamas militants. Hannah Ben-Artzi, who was 69, was killed in Kfar Aviv by a rocket when she was trying to open a public shelter for people without access to shelters in their homes. Arab Israeli paramedic Awad Darwesh, a Muslim who courageously stayed to treat the injured, was murdered at the music festival. Sydney-born 66-year-old Australian Galit Carbone was found dead outside her home in a kibbutz in southern Israel. Our hearts go out to them and especially to the families and friends of those who are still missing and those who are in captivity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I put my children to bed at night, I think of the parents who did this without knowing what the morning would bring and those who don't know if they children are still alive. This conflict is far from over. There has already been a tragic loss of civilians on both sides. I urge everyone to reach out to their friends and loved ones who may be struggling during these times, and offer support and comfort. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This conflict may be far away, but it touches the country very deeply and particularly my community of Wentworth. Every member of the Jewish community in Wentworth, which is the largest Jewish community in the country, and many members of the broader community have been shaken and personally affected. They are traumatised. Many have returned or are trying to return from Israel now. They have lost friends and family members. They have family members who were taken hostage and they are agonisingly waiting for news.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am deeply concerned that we are also seeing acts of hate and antisemitism in our own community. Since last weekend, nearly 200 people have emailed me and my team, feeling unsafe and shaken, especially after the disturbing antisemitic incident that occurred at the Sydney Opera House. One woman told me about how she was in one of the buildings in the CBD as people were marching down to the opera house and saying slogans, some of which have been repeated today in the parliament. She was scared, and so many of my Jewish community in Wentworth are scared. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Condoning violence and celebrating attacks on innocent civilians is unacceptable. It is not part of this country. In the words of a very good friend of mine, 'Australia is scary, which is awful, as it's possibly one of the best places in the world to be Jewish.' All of us in this place must speak with one voice in saying that this is unacceptable, and we must ensure that those who are at risk of harm here are reminded through our words and deeds that they are safe, they are welcome and they are part of our community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Wednesday evening I was honoured to stand alongside thousands of my community in Dover Heights, in solidarity with Israel. It was a solemn and moving evening but also a reminder that, despite the horrors that have occurred, this community stands strong and is proud to be Jewish. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At Edgecliff station last week, I met a young Jewish woman who was wearing a Star of David necklace. She told me that she felt scared—scared to be so openly Jewish at a time when the consequences of hate have become so abundantly clear. But she also felt determined—determined not to stay inside; determined not to let fear dictate how she lived; determined not to hide her identity, her courage and her strength. The courage of a community that has suffered so much for so long is inspiring, and it needs to inspire us as Australians to action: local action to support members of our community who are suffering, and international action to support an ally that has been mercilessly attacked—a country who shares our commitment to democracy and a society that shares our values. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Israel has an inherent and fundamental right to defend itself and safeguard its citizens against those horrifying acts of terror. Do not be mistaken. These are not acts of resistance. Australia must stand with Israel at this difficult time, alongside so many other countries around the world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People should not let sympathy for the Palestinians' legitimate aspiration for statehood, which is a very legitimate aspiration and one that I share—I share the aspiration for a state of Israel and a state of Palestine that are free and secure, alongside each other—blind them to the fact that Hamas remains dedicated to a world where Israel does not exist. Many of my Jewish community, while mourning their own, have expressed their deep concern about the impact of this horrific attack on Palestinian civilians. I share those concerns very deeply. This has created a tragedy for all of those living in Israel and Gaza. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hamas and its backers are recklessly pursuing their interests rather than those of the Palestinian people. It is Hamas and its backers—and I will call out Iran in this, because it is part of what has happened here—that are using civilians as shields. Hamas cannot be a partner for peace in the Middle East. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We continue to pray for the welfare of those who are currently being held in captivity and to wish a complete recovery to those who have been wounded. Um Yis-ra-elle hai.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:41</span>):  Australia enjoys a degree of social cohesion that is the envy of the world. Our peaceful life here is adorned with totems of our multicultural heritage—food from every corner of the world, temples, synagogues, mosques, churches, Indigenous place names and art. Most importantly it is the kaleidoscope of faces converging in our schools, sporting fields, workplaces and indeed our own parliament. Our interconnectedness means that attacks on any one group of our Australian family is an attack on us all. Australia is a bright spot in an increasingly polarised and unstable world. It is not, however, immune to forces beyond our shores. Events overseas have sent shockwaves that have rippled through our community, but those ripples can gather force, tearing at our social fabric, depending on how we as leaders and as a community respond. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The terrorist attacks in Israel by Hamas have sent shockwaves around the world, including into my own community. These attacks on innocent Israeli Jews, Israeli Arabs, nonresidents from around the world, adults and children, men and women, from babies through to the very old, were barbaric and have been described by Jews as the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust. It is incomprehensible to see babies held hostage, separated from their mothers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every Jewish constituent I've spoken to in the last week has been affected. People are toggling between rage and grief and despair. They are in shock, emotionally exhausted, and they feel helpless. This is an intergenerational trauma in the making. They have lost loved ones or know of people who have. Some have been separated from families, others are worried sick for loved ones who have been called up for active duty. These are cousins, sons and daughters, reservists and defence personnel. It is harrowing for all involved and harrowing to witness. It's vicarious trauma beaming throughout the world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Israel's response was swift. A state of war was declared, troops were mobilised, and the counteroffensive began. The counternarrative was equally swift. This is about the oppression of Palestinians in the largest open-air prison in the world. This is about Palestinian self-determination. This is about a 16-year-old blockade in Gaza, with an undercurrent that Jews are somehow co-conspirators in this tragedy. It is grotesque. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The pretext for these abhorrent attacks by Hamas was the liberation of the Palestinian people. How is that credible when these attacks have irrevocably harmed the cause of the Palestinian people, setting back their cause years if not longer? They are now fleeing for their lives from an Israeli bombardment that was predictable and predictably overwhelming. There are no winners—none at all—when violence is the currency and lives the collateral. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have some understanding of the deep mistrust and entrenched enmity between these sides. I went to Israel on a cross-party parliamentary delegation with the Speaker in late July. It was a non-stop listening tour, an immersive experience, like a semester's worth of knowledge crammed into one week. I understand that emotions are running high, that both sides are demanding to be heard and to be seen. I urge people who regale me at the shops or fill up my inbox to hold your judgement and instead hold your fellow Australians' hands. It is too early to be moralising when bombs are raining down and tears flow like a flood.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I denounce the antisemitism we have witnessed in the aftermath of the Hamas attack. I am unwilling to repeat what has been said. I can't actually bring myself to do so because it is so poisonous. We have seen some reprehensible behaviour at a protest early on in Sydney, but fortunately nothing in the last few days in large protests in Melbourne and Sydney, which were peaceful and, largely, respectful. Let's keep it that way, even when things go from bad to worse overseas. For my 6½ thousand Jewish constituents, hate speech and the prancing of cowardly Neo-Nazis with their salutes and concealed faces in our public places are a direct threat to their sense of belonging and to their sense of attachment with our community. It is deeply destabilising, and it triggers memories of the Holocaust—an intergenerational trauma that is baked into the DNA of the Jewish people and Israel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The banning of the Nazi salute by the Victorian government and the imminent introduction of the Albanese government's counterterrorism bill banning the display of Nazi symbols is timely and will make those groups pause before they act. Jewish constituents have been advised to send their children to school in plain clothes. Some are wondering, when they drop off their children, whether they will see them again. Some have even removed visible accoutrements denoting their Jewish identity. They are worried for their safety in public places and also at public gatherings or vigils which are being held in solidarity with Israel and to support one another.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But antisemitism hurts us all. It ripples beyond the Jewish community, destabilising the wellbeing of the entire community. Why? It's because we are a multicultural nation, with 50 per cent of us either having been born overseas or having a parent who was born overseas. Many of the waves of migrants coming to Australia fled wars themselves. Those memories endure in them and in their children. Migrants have all encountered racism. I—we—know what it's like. Others have experienced discrimination based on attributes like gender, age, disability, sexuality or ancestry. No-one should feel like they do not belong in Australia. An attack on one is an attack on us all. This is why hate speech and hateful behaviour have no place in our country. Leave them at the door. In the midst of this is the fog of misinformation, with social media as the smoke machine. Add generative AI to the mix, and we have a really dangerous situation where we start to question what our eyes are seeing. Is it real or is it fake? Refrain from the hot takes from everyone except trusted sources. As this conflict escalates, there are lots of reasons to tighten up our misinformation laws, as we in the Albanese government intend to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is the responsibility of leaders. As I said in my first speech:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… I have watched with alarm as words used in this chamber ricochet around the country, tearing at our social fabric. Spillover effects are acts of hate on our streets against Asians, Jews, Muslims, people of colour, the gender diverse. And the gun gets fired here. We have a choice. We can accept the politics of division or devalue that currency to junk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been disturbed at the sight of those opposite using the unfolding war in Israel as a means to prove their allegiance to Jews. Tough talk plays to populist politics that those opposite are addicted to, but that is not leadership. Using political rhetoric as a competition for loyalty only risks inflaming domestic tensions. A war is no time for chest beating for political advantage. There are no winners here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To our Jewish community, you know our sincerity. We were there with you at the birth of your nation. Know our responsibility also to you and our wider community in keeping our Australian family safe. If we are all safe, then you also will be safe. My priority is to protect my community and maintain social cohesion so that mums can drop their kids off at school and students can attend uni without fear; so that people can attend their synagogues or mosques without fear of reprisals; and so that Australians can wear the hijab or the kippah without fear.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Arab constituents, including Palestinians, are also worried sick. Like the Jewish people, they are angry, grieving and despairing. Palestinian aspirations for self-determination are legitimate, but they have been let down. They have been let down and abandoned by a terrorist organisation that is treating them as pawns in a grand power play. It is the height of treachery. They are suffering and will suffer more in the coming days to weeks. There are no winners. Israel will defend herself, as she must, and she will retaliate, as she should. We, including many Israelis, the Jewish diaspora and Australians, are rightly concerned about the prospect of mass casualties in Gaza. I'm also concerned about Islamophobic rhetoric here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We urge the protection of civilian lives and join others in calling for Israel to operate by the rules of international law. We have provided an initial $10 million in humanitarian assistance to Gazans. We call for safe and unimpeded humanitarian access for those civilians.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The hell of war is unfolding in all its devastation, but my task is to keep that hell away from our doorstep. It is not welcome here and nor are microaggressions or aggressions overt or covert in our workplaces, sporting teams, faith groups, streets, schools or online. Now is the time we lock as Australians and support each other. Hold the judgement. Hold the hot takes. Now is not the time for that. Now is the time to hold each other and seek out differing perspectives even if they are uncomfortable. Reach out to people affected of any ethnic or religious persuasion and offer support. Be an ally. That is the Australian way. I thank the House.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FLETCHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:51</span>):  I join with other members of the House in offering my deepest condolences to the people of Israel during this unimaginably difficult period, and I condemn the unconscionable violence carried out by the brutal terrorists of Hamas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Bradfield, I am proud to represent the federal electorate with the second largest Jewish community in New South Wales. I am proud to represent a community that is home to four synagogues and a Jewish school. That community, of course, is devastated by what is taking place. Last Monday, I attended a prayer evening at one of our local synagogues, Kehillat Masada. It was profoundly moving. The service was organised by four synagogues coming together—Kehillat Masada, Chabad North Shore, North Shore Synagogue and Cremorne Synagogue—and we were joined as well by worshippers from other local synagogues and synagogues across Sydney, including North Shore Temple Emanuel. Over recent days I have been told by a number of Jewish constituents of friends, family members or others known to them directly or indirectly who have been killed, injured or abducted in Israel. What is happening is very direct and immediate in its impact on Australia's Jewish community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The attacks by Hamas in Israel were shocking, they were violent and they deserve absolute condemnation. To kill, injure and take hostage innocent and unarmed men, women and children is a violation of every principle of morality, of decency and of respect for human dignity. It is reported that more than 1,300 people have been killed in Israel so far. Some of those who were abducted are presently hostages, experiencing unimaginable terror. The victims of these attacks have also included citizens of other countries, including Australia. The depraved and horrific nature of much of this violence, including sexual violence and deliberate harm to young children, is sickening. Actions like this are pure barbarism. They have been carried out by terrorists whose creed is defined by evil and hatred. Their mission is to destroy vibrant communities and to cause misery. These attacks are an attack on civilisation. They're an attack on fundamental human values.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, that such violence should be visited among Jewish people is a chilling reminder of the evils of the Holocaust. Once again, Jewish people have been killed and injured specifically because of hatred for their religion. To see equivocation on these issues by some Australian politicians over the past week and a half has been inexplicable. Regardless of one's political affiliations, violence of this nature must be condemned. It's unjustifiable. It's inexcusable. To see a small minority of Australians actively celebrating these violent and dehumanising attacks has been disgusting. The actions of protesters in Sydney last Monday evening were disgusting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is one of the world's most successful multicultural, multiracial and multi-ethnic societies. That success has been achieved through hard work over many decades with the strong support of both major political parties and the goodwill and efforts of millions of Australians. Our success, our continued success, depends on all Australians being committed to mutual respect, to mutual tolerance and to mutual understanding. My electorate is a microcosm of Australia in this regard. As I mentioned, it has four synagogues; I have visited all of them on multiple occasions. Of course there are multiple churches in my electorate. And there is a Sikh temple, or gurdwara, and at least one Buddhist temple. Recently, I was pleased to visit the Hornsby Dawah Community Service—the Hornsby Masjid—a centre for people of Islamic faith in my electorate and surrounding areas. I know that the good people who worship at the synagogues in my electorate are concerned about the safety of innocent Palestinian people in Gaza. I know that, equally, the people who worship at the Hornsby Masjid want to see peace, safety and security for all. And I know that, despite the actions of a small number of people last Monday night, the overwhelming majority of Australians want to see Israeli people safe and people in Gaza safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I express my strong support for the state of Israel, the people of Israel, the Jewish people and Jewish Australians, including, of course, my Jewish constituents in Bradfield, and all who are suffering at the hands of Hamas. I express my strong support for Israel's acts of self defence. Israel is a vigorous multiparty democracy, a beacon of freedom around the world, and it is the homeland of the Jewish people. I call on the Australian government to provide strong and clear support for the government of Israel as it works to restore order and defend its citizens. I call for continued work towards a lasting two-state solution, with the peaceful coexistence of two independent nations. Amongst the many reasons to be appalled by these violent terrorist attacks by Hamas is that they have grievously set back progress towards that lasting peace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I take this opportunity to acknowledge the courage and leadership of the representative bodies of the Australian Jewish community, including the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, the New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies and the many other bodies. I close by saying that I am confident that despite the extraordinary challenges and the very difficult times ahead, the values embodied in the state of Israel—of civilisation, of education, of faith, of tolerance and of democracy—will prevail.</span>

                  <a href="193430" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WATTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gellibrand</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:58</span>):  Australia stands against terrorism and we stand in solidarity with Israel. The Australian government unequivocally condemns the horrific violence that we have seen: indiscriminate rocket fire, the brutal targeting of civilians and the taking of hostages. Over 1,300 civilians in Israel have been murdered by Hamas and as many as 150 taken hostage in Gaza, with much of the barbarism broadcast by the butchers to a horrified world—the elderly, babies, mums and dads murdered in their homes. Young people, dancers, were gunned down at a music festival, as were citizens from more than 30 nations, including a beloved Australian grandmother, Galit Carbone. May her memory be a blessing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We grieve deeply with all of those who have lost loved ones. We know that so many people in our Australian community are mourning what has happened. So many are fearful for friends and family who are still at risk. There is the unimaginable pain of witnessing the worst loss of Jewish life since the Holocaust, but in Israel itself—the very territory intended to provide a safe haven.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These events reopen profound historical wounds, and we understand how that brings back trauma—old traumas, generational traumas—for so many. There is absolutely no context that can justify the violence and depravity that we have seen perpetrated by Hamas against civilians. These are the heinous acts of terrorists and unconscionable breaches of international law. The slaughter and kidnapping of children and other innocents cannot be celebrated by any moral human being. I call urgently for the release of all hostages, some of whom, as we have seen, are small children. I reiterate Israel's right to defend itself, to ensure the security of its people and to prevent such an attack from ever taking place again. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hamas is a listed terrorist group. It has long advocated the destruction of the state of Israel and the eradicate of Jews. Not only do its actions hurt Israelis, but it has long exploited the community in Gaza for protection, hiding behind civilians and civilian infrastructure in facilities like schools, apartment buildings and hospitals. As a result, so many Palestinian families are suffering through no fault of their own. Nearly half of the population of Gaza is under 18; they're children. We know that Hamas does not speak for ordinary Palestinians, but instead it hides behind them. Hamas is also seeking to prevent the departure of foreign nationals from Gaza in callous tactics that show us the cruel nature of the group that we are dealing with. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are serious times that call for serious leadership. When faced with such horrendous events, in this place we are called upon to rise to the occasion, to speak clearly about what's occurred and to bring our community together in solidarity. That is why it is essential that we clearly condemn Hamas and its terrorist attacks. Hamas does not seek peace. Among the many other tragedies caused by these attacks, we recognise that Hamas's actions have set back the cause of peace. It has pushed a two-state solution further out of reach. We continue to support an enduring and just peace for Israelis and Palestinians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We in the Australian government support the protection of innocent life in this conflict and in all conflicts. That is what we have consistently advocated for in all circumstances. In this conflict further lives are at stake. Civilians on all sides are suffering, and the humanitarian situation in Gaza is deteriorating. Medical care, water, and sanitation and nutrition needs are growing. President Biden of the United States has called on Israel to operate by the rules of war in response to Hamas's attacks, and we support those calls. Adherence to international law mitigates against this conflict widening. This matters for civilians on all sides and for Israel's own national security. If conflict were to spill over across the region, risks to Israel's security would be compounded, as they would be for all Israeli and Palestinian civilians and civilian populations throughout the region. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government is working hard to support the work of the United States, Egypt and others to establish humanitarian access to Gaza. To ensure relief can reach civilians affected by the conflict, we call for safe and unimpeded humanitarian access to Gaza. We're providing an initial $10 million in humanitarian assistance for civilians affected by the conflict. Through the International Committee of the Red Cross, UNICEF and UNOPS, this funding will help to restore services, provide medical support, restore hygiene services and support nutrition and child protection. We will continue to assess the humanitarian situation as it develops and stand ready to provide further support. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the midst of this horrific situation, officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been working around the clock to assist Australians looking to leave the region. This has been our highest priority. I'm pleased to report more than 1,200 Australians who wished to leave have now done so. Last week we secured commercial options for assisted departures and readied the ADF to assist, should the need arise. On Friday the first flight, operated free of charge by Qantas, took more than 200 Australians out of Tel Aviv to safety. Overnight, a further three flights have departed Tel Aviv, including two RAAF flights. We've had available seats on all of these flights. A further flight will depart today, after which we will consider whether further assisted departure flights are needed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">DFAT continue to assist a further 1,540 registered Australians across Israel, the West Bank and Gaza. I'd like to highlight the hard work of officials both overseas and here in our crisis centre in Australia. Australian staff and those employed locally at our posts in the Middle East have been working through the night, every night, to put together the best possible options for Australians wanting to leave. Australians in the affected areas who want to leave and need assistance with departure should register via DFAT's crisis portal or by calling the 24-hour consular emergency centre. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Back home in Australia, we know that extremists are seeking to exploit this situation for their own ends. There will always be those who try to divide our community for their own ends. We all need to resist this. We need to look at the common bonds between us to see our common humanity. People come to Australia because they want to live in a country that's peaceful, tolerant and respectful. I don't need to tell you how important it is that we protect that. There's no place in Australian communities for antisemitism or Islamophobia. There's no place in our community for hate speech. The antisemitic slogans that we've heard at some protests in recent times have been rightly condemned by the Prime Minister, the foreign minister and many others, and I add my condemnation. Those that engage in these acts must understand that their hatred runs contrary to the values that we all share as Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just as there's no space in our society for antisemitism, nor is there any space for Islamophobia or other types of intolerance or racism. My community in Melbourne's west is one of the most diverse faith communities in Australia. We know firsthand it takes real work to promote community. We know firsthand the effort it takes to build mutual understanding and respect across cultural and religious lines, and we know firsthand how carefully we must protect that sense of community. In recent days my community has seen Neo-Nazi groups seeking to intimidate members of the community in Melbourne's west, and I call for these actions to be thoroughly investigated by law enforcement authorities and for those responsible to be held to account. We know it is all too easy for community safety to be undermined by violent or extreme rhetoric. We should also understand that, as we speak, there is disinformation circulating, deliberately spread by bad-faith actors, landing on our screens and our smart phones and on those of our neighbours and friends. I ask Australians to be aware of the threats of this disinformation, to report and watch out for disinformation and to take care with what you share and what you post. It can stoke division and hatred. At worst, it can put lives at risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The gravity of these times calls for all Australians to stand against hate, so I ask that we all consider how we can discuss these difficult issues with respect and understanding for difference. Maintaining respect and understanding for each other here at home is so essential. As I said before, it's why so many people come to our country. It's part of who we are as Australians, part of the nation and society that we've all built here together—a place where people can come from around the world in search of new beginnings, a better society and a better way of doing things. It's part of our Australian identity. It's important, to sustain this community, that we fight those who preach hatred. As a great Australian, Eddie Jaku OAM, himself a Holocaust survivor, once said, 'Hate is the beginning of a disease, like cancer. It may kill your enemy, but will destroy you in the process too.' In these difficult times, we must all stand against hate, seek the common humanity that we share and invest in what makes our Australian community so great. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:08</span>):  In speaking on this grave motion, I'd like firstly to identify with every word the member for Gellibrand said. I thank him for the way he represented his community and the people of Australia in the address he's just given to the parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are no words to describe the horror that Australian people felt on hearing the news of the Hamas attack on the people of Israel. A terrorist organisation was sent to kill as many people as possible, with absolutely no care for age, for frailty or for youth. It's an attack that seems, in Australia, incomprehensible to us as a nation. I saw how it affected my own family and community—how distressed they were. I know they would have all gone and projected themselves into the situation in that kibbutz where people went to bed the night before and woke up to gunshots at their front doors and in their homes. We saw the killing of innocent people, young people in their absolute prime at a youth get-together for people who wanted to dance and sing. Each one of us thinks of our own grandchildren, friends and family. That could have been us. Who knows where the next attack will come from?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there are two perpetrators of the pain and death that's happening in the Middle East at this time. Hamas have not only attacked Israel in such a heinous way but, worse than that, have purposefully attacked the Palestinian people. They use children in kindergartens as their shelter. They use sick people in hospitals as their shelter, knowing that the leadership of Hamas will not be attacked if they use that cover. Hezbollah are the same.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been to Israel on two occasions at behest of the government of the day, so it was incomprehensible to me that there could be a break in the defences as there were. That's because I know the ability of the Israelis to protect their borders. I've been to their borders and I've stood there and seen firsthand when they point out where Hezbollah and Hamas are. Using the Palestinian people in this way, virtually as human sacrifices for their bent and twisted cause, confronts us in this country, where we're so used to freedom of movement and freedom of activity—freedom of everything. It's not possible that anything like that could happen; but it has, and I think the response of this federal government has been totally appropriate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Gellibrand said, people are dancing on the graves of those poor people who have fallen. Our sympathy goes out to them and to those who have been kidnapped or injured. Can we possibly put ourselves in the place of how they feel, where an Israeli father says to the world, 'I'd rather my daughter be dead than kidnapped?' He said, 'Yes, she's dead', and he went on to explain how horrific Hamas can be with hostages. They're holding those hostages, and we've seen a Hamas fighter standing there with toddlers in his arms. That brought tears to the eyes of many around me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I stand with Israel, as this nation does. I stand, especially, knowing that there are Palestinians even in this country who wish for the end of the state of Israel. That is not going to happen. They have every right to respond to protect their border and to protect their people, and that's what they will do with all the force needed. But the tragedy of that is that Hamas will use thousands and thousands and thousands of Palestinians who will be sacrificed for their aims, without any care whatsoever of their health, wellbeing or safety.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is happening right now as we speak. As we speak, the Israelis are prepared to go into the Gaza Strip, probably one of the most heavily populated areas in the world, with few opportunities for those people to escape from the Israeli incursion. None of us can understand what we would be doing, what decisions we would be making now if we were in the shoes of those in Israel and in Palestine. How would our heartache and consideration be if it was one of us? How would you think and feel if it was your wife, your father? A friend said over dinner on Friday, 'Two of my cousins have been called up by the Israeli army, and they have easily gone.' The way he said it was, 'My family is about to sacrifice these two young men to the cause.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Israelis have put together more than 300,000 men and women, reservists called in. As we stand, Australia will do its best, and, I believe, the government will do its best to support wherever we need to support, whatever we can do. There will be humanitarian aid from this country for the peoples of Israel and the peoples of Palestine. But let me say: we will fight with every breath and every energy we have against antisemitism and Islamophobia, because this nation is better than those demonstrations we saw last week in Sydney. We're better than that, and Australians will always stand up for the right—the right for people to speak out, yes, and the right to be heard in that freedom.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="13050" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ALY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Early Childhood Education and Minister for Youth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:18</span>):  In my first speech in this place I made reference to the fact that I was born in a region of the world where time is marked by war. My generation, we don't call ourselves the children of 1967; we call ourselves the children of the Naksa because that is the cross that we bear being born in the year of that war.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it was Helmut Kohl who said that peace must be more than the absence of war, but certainly in Palestine and Israel peace is nothing but the absence of war. When I think about that, I think about that as being a very precarious way to live. It's a very fragile peace that people live in, isn't it? They live in a world and in a region of uncertainty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let me say this: peace will not be achieved by terrorism. Peace will not be achieved by bombs. Piece will not be achieved by war. Peace will not be achieved by violence. For peace to be achieved in the region, it requires significant political will—a political will that reflects the ambition and the aspirations of the people of Israel and the people of Palestine. I visited both Israel and Palestine on two occasions. Let me say, from talking to the people there: they hope for more. They hope for more than just an existence that is defined by the absence of war.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to turn to the attacks on Israel by Hamas, which, under every definition of terrorism—and there are many; there are international definitions as well as a number of definitions by different countries—that act, the violence that we saw perpetrated by Hamas, was terrorism and should be condemned in every possible way. So too should any actions and any demonstrations that seek to celebrate the death and destruction of Israelis be condemned, loudly and unequivocally. I want to say this to members of my faith community: celebrating the death and destruction of Israelis is un-Islamic. There is no other word for it. It is un-Islamic. I pay heed to Sheikh Shady and Dr Ibraham from the Australian National Imams Council for the statements that they've put out. I know that the minister Ed Husic behind me agrees with me on this—we've spoken about this at length—and I pay heed to him as well for the strong way in which he has also spoken alongside Sheikh Shady and the Imams Council in condemning the actions of those protesters who sought to celebrate the tragic and heinous attack on Israelis by Hamas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Terrorists by definition do not follow the rules of warfare. While many of us—most of us; most decent people—abhor war and abhor violence, the fact is that war is at times an inevitable part of the human condition. That is the reason that we have a Geneva convention. That is the reason that we have rules of war, rules of warfare and rules that dictate what is expected of states and humane treatment, particularly of civilians, in times of war. As I said, terrorists do not abide by the rules of war. It's one of the reasons that they are terrorists. It's one of the reasons that acts of terrorism are defined as such, because they do not abide by those rules of war. For that, they should be condemned. Absolutely, with every breath, they should be condemned. There is absolutely no justification for what Hamas did—no justification for the attacks on innocent Israelis that we have seen. Those who seek to justify what Hamas did in Israel do an incredible disservice not just to Israelis but to Palestinians alike. But the rules of war are there, and one of the greatest fears that I have—and I know that this fear extends to those in my community, in my faith community—is the escalation of violence in Palestine and Israel for people—innocent people in Israel; innocent people in Palestine—whose existence is defined by the absence of war. As I said, it's a precarious existence. It's not a way to live. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also appropriate that we should join with the US administration in urging that, as the violence escalates, the rules of war are adhered to, and that those international rules of war that have been agreed upon, particularly in terms of the humanitarian treatment of civilians and the humanitarian treatment of the casualties of war, should be abided by. It is right for us to stand and make the statement that we expect the rules of warfare to also be applied in the ongoing conflict. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a part in the Koran and the Sunna that talks about humanity as if it were a body, and where any part of the body hurts the whole body feels pain. As Muslims, we're urged to look at our brothers and our sisters in humanity in this way: what hurts you also hurts me; what pains you also pains me. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's difficult to stand here now and talk about this issue without feeling the pain of the Israeli people, without feeling the pain of the Jewish community in my electorate of Cowan—and I send my regards to the community in my electorate of Cowan, to Geoff Midalia and the community there—and without also feeling the pain of the Palestinian people, who are also innocent and who will also bear the brunt of war: women, children and men. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't know the way out of this. I don't know the way to peace, but I do know that violence only begets violence. I do know that political will is required on both sides to get through this impasse and see a way forward. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I end this by putting a callout to all members of the Australian Muslim community and to urge them, also: I know that you are hurting. I know that this is a deeply emotional issue for you, but as Muslims it is our responsibility to show compassion and empathy for all humanity. I urge people to remember that we live in a democratic and free country. I urge them to remember the hard times that we went through when Islamophobia was rife, and to hold back and remember that there is no place in this country for antisemitism and no place for Islamophobia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AKI" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DUTTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dickson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:30</span>):  This Prime Minister stated in the course of the last parliament, right through the election campaign, that he would take debates. He was critical of the previous Prime Minister for not taking suspensions, and somehow this would be a government of transparency, the sunlight would shine in and this Prime Minister would run a new system, a more transparent system. But do you think that has happened today? Again, no, it hasn't. It hasn't happened, because the Prime Minister doesn't want to talk about his role in dividing our nation in a way that no predecessor of his has since Federation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to point out that the Prime Minister has taken the nation on a $450 million merry-go-round that has resulted in a situation where he raised expectations for Indigenous Australians. He told them that he could deliver an outcome which he never had capacity to deliver. He said to the Australian people that he was going to ask for their support but then refused to provide any of the detail, which, again, is completely and utterly without precedent. What prime minister takes the country to a position of division? What Prime Minister says to the Australian public, 'I have a proposal before you, the biggest change proposed to our nation's rule book, the insertion of a new chapter in the Constitution,' and then doesn't give the detail? There was no constitutional convention where there was a discussion of views, and Greg Craven's piece in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian </span>today is constructive. There's been no point in our country's history where a prime minister hasn't sought a bipartisan position in relation to such a totemic issue. There's no precedent for it whatsoever.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister wasn't interested in the unifying moment. The unifying moment, as history now records, would have been to ask Australians whether they supported recognition of Indigenous Australians in our Constitution. The Prime Minister didn't do that. He sought to use the goodwill toward that recognition to mask the unpopularity of the Voice. His plan was to speak in this coded language—and you saw him chopping and changing over the course of the campaign as to what that language was, but essentially his proposition was to try and mask the Voice with constitutional recognition. Why did he do that? Because he knew that the Voice couldn't stand on its own two feet. He knew that he couldn't explain the design of it, because this Prime Minister is never across the detail.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw it during the campaign. We've seen it in relation to cost-of-living measures. We've seen it in relation to two budgets now. The Australian public is crying out for support from their Prime Minister, from their government, to help them with cost-of-living pressures, but this Prime Minister has been completely obsessed with the Voice for the last 17 months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It came as a surprise to Australians on election night when, having had no real discussion in the course of the last election campaign, the Prime Minister announced that this would be his highest priority. So, instinctively, at the start, Australians of goodwill said, 'Okay, well, do we want to improve the lives of Indigenous Australians, particularly in regional and remote areas? Of course we do. So we support the Prime Minister's proposition. We take it at face value, in good faith'—expecting that the detail was going to be provided, expecting that there would be an understanding of how these practical outcomes could be delivered. But, instead, none of it was furnished. In fact, had there been success in the referendum on the weekend, had the 'yes' vote prevailed, the design process was due to have started this Monday. Now, I don't know whether they've leased office space. I don't know whether people have been employed. I don't know whether design architects have been engaged by the Commonwealth. But think about that proposition for a moment, because I think the Australian people thought about it over the course of this campaign. They were being asked to vote on the Saturday for something that was to be designed the following Monday.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The whole concept of cart and horse comes to mind here, but this Prime Minister stuck steadfastly with it. Why? I mean, why was he not able to explain it? Why did the design not start until after the vote had taken place? We know that he hadn't read the full detail. We know that he hadn't engaged properly to understand what it was that was being proposed. Whilst he stood at one point in this chamber waving around the Calma-Langton report—remember that—when we asked him for the details upfront, he said, 'Why don't you read the Calma-Langton report?' As it turns out, he'd never read it, because the Calma-Langton report didn't recommend going to a referendum, the way the Prime Minister did, at a cost of $450 million. The Calma-Langton report recommended that local and regional bodies be formed and provide advice to the government. That wasn't what the Prime Minister adopted. He went against even the advice of those experts that had put the model together. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why did that expert body consider going to local and regional arrangements before going to a national model, which they'd recommended against? It was because they knew, as he did, that the Australian public wouldn't support it. Noel Pearson himself is on the record as having said this quite prophetically a number of years ago: the Australian public would not support a referendum question put to them that went to a model that hadn't been explained or hadn't been in practice to demonstrate how it could provide the outcomes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is no flippant situation that we're dealing with. This is a Prime Minister who made a conscious decision, ultimately searching for his Redfern moment or his apology moment. He wants to be one of the great leaders of the Labor Party. He sees himself as Bob Hawke. He regularly sees himself in the mirror as Bob Hawke. This bloke is no Bob Hawke, let me tell you that much. This bloke is not Bob Hawke. But I'll tell you who he is. Every single day the incompetence displayed by this Prime Minister and his ministers on rising electricity prices, on rising insurance bills, on getting less and less when you turn up to the supermarket for every dollar that you spend, has him looking more and more like his mentor: Kevin Rudd. K-Rudd, A-Albanese—A-Disaster-Albanese. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Prime Minister is no light on the hill. There's no question about it. This Prime Minister is a fading light, a flickering light on the hill. He is a flake, and he doesn't have the capacity to show the leadership this country deserves. If this Prime Minister was a Hawke figure, if this Prime Minister had any of the capability or capacity of Bob Hawke, he would stand up and take responsibility for the reckless course that he has taken our country on over the course of the last month and a bit. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This country didn't deserve to be divided. Indigenous Australians deserve more from their Prime Minister. They didn't deserve to have their expectations raised unfairly and without any opportunity or likely prospect of success. We stood in this chamber and we advised the Prime Minister respectfully, having asked question after question for the detail, that this would not pass on the vibe. The Prime Minister decided instead to go down a path to divide our country and spend $450 million that could have provided endless support to Indigenous communities, to those kids. This Prime Minister does not deserve the support of the Australian people.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Farrer</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:39</span>):  I second the motion. I'm delighted to support the Leader of the Opposition in this suspension of standing and sessional orders. In so doing, I condemn this Prime Minister for his divisive and incompetently managed referendum. I condemn this Prime Minister for refusing to hold a constitutional convention, making no effort whatsoever to achieve bipartisanship, wasting $450 million of taxpayer money and proceeding with his personal vanity project when it was so, so clear that it was going to go disastrously wrong. This is the referendum that Australia did not need to have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister's incompetence has split Australia right down the middle, and still he refuses to apologise. I listened carefully on Saturday night. I heard a reluctant acknowledgement of taking responsibility and then an immediate blame-shift because that's what this Prime Minister does. He doesn't understand that, when you are at the top of the country, you get to take responsibility. Instead of accepting blame, his response was a bit like, 'Oh well, we tried.' He made this outrageous claim that this was an election promise and therefore it was delivered. It was a rare moment, actually, when the facade cracked and we finally saw the Prime Minister admit that this was always about the electoral politics. Today he kept a straight face and he bemoaned the fact that referendums don't succeed without bipartisan support. But Prime Minister, in the Liberal and National parties, we decided more than six months ago that we wouldn't give this referendum bipartisan support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister's a well-known political hack. He's a student of political history. He knew that we would not support this referendum, but he chose to proceed anyway. It's just not good enough from our nation's leader. As I've said for months, if I were an advocate of the 'yes' campaign, I would be so disappointed with this Prime Minister. I would be so disappointed in how he handled this referendum and made his case because Australians across this country have been confronted with an arrogant prime minister whose first words as national leader were to write a cheque he should have known he was never in a position to cash.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His first pledge on election night was to enact in full a proposition which was completely unfamiliar to the Australian people. It was a commitment he made with a mandate that was manufactured from a technicality but not transparency. It was a promise he made to our First Australians that he could never keep. In the 18 months since, time and again the Prime Minister has arrogantly placed ideology over practicality. He tried to wedge his political opponents for electoral benefit, but what did we see this Prime Minister do? He took a 65 per cent majority for yes to an almost 65 per cent majority for no, directly because of his decisions. He ignored all warnings. He failed to course-correct. He made it clear that it was his way or the highway, and he forced Australians to choose the highway. He's taken us to a moment of national disunity, and it's hurt our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indigenous Australians and many people across the community have walked a long way in this process. I want to acknowledge those many people who have invested a great deal in good faith to this effort. But, in putting his own political legacy before a long walk of reconciliation, the Prime Minister sprinted ahead and left Australians behind. It's a familiar theme. He charges ahead on this, and he leaves Australians behind. He's left Australians behind every single day since he became Prime Minister. The Australian people have responded clearly in rejecting this divisive approach. Now the Prime Minister should apologise. He should apologise for how he has mishandled this process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This suspension motion is not just about condemning the Prime Minister, important though that is. It's about a better way as proposed by the Leader of the Opposition. It's about practical things that we can get on with right here and right now: a royal commission into child sexual abuse in Indigenous communities—how can this Prime Minister today arrogantly dismiss that suggestion with a jeer and a sneer that we're all so familiar with in this place?—and a careful audit of the expenditure on Indigenous programs, the money that comes from government and goes out into the community. Every taxpayer deserves the best value for their dollar, but, most importantly, every Indigenous Australian deserves the best value for their dollar.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have never ever stepped back from what we have always said in Indigenous Australians policy: we will support practical policy ideas that improve the lives of Indigenous Australians, that help close the gap and that allow us to come together and forge a better path forward to deliver a better future for this country, because Australians should be proud of our country. We're fair minded, good hearted, compassionate people, and we care. We care about the future of this country and the future of our Indigenous communities. It was outrageous that we did not go ahead with this suspension earlier and debate this important issue for the Australian people. Shame on the Prime Minister!</span>

This referendum was an idea that came from First Nations Australians. A voice to parliament was an idea that came from First Nations Australians, and the referendum was always about keeping faith with those First Nations Australians and the Australian people and delivering on the commitment that the government made, prior to the last election, to hold a referendum of the Australian people on the issue of a voice to parliament. We maintained that commitment on the weekend.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, the issue of constitutional recognition of First Nations Australians is something that was established by the previous coalition government. It was a process that was started by the Abbott government. There were literally thousands of consultations that took place across the country by First Nations Australians, culminating in a constitutional convention at Uluru in 2017. The Uluru constitutional convention was very clear with the Statement from the Heart and a request of government to hold a referendum of the Australian people to enshrine a voice in the Constitution. This government delivered on that commitment. We delivered on that commitment on the weekend, and the one thing that you can say about the Prime Minister out on the weekend is that the Prime Minister is a man of his word.

Then, when the current Leader of the Opposition took the reins, the situation suddenly changed. They even established a process when they were in government: a codesign process with a number of committees. The member for Berowra chaired one of those committees. There were thorough consultations of the Australian people, and it came up with a process. That process was designed by the Liberal and National parties in government, and now they've walked away from it. It was this Leader of the Opposition who walked away from that process. He walked away from it a number of months ago.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the campaign for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice to parliament, the Leader of the Opposition said: 'Oh, don't worry. You can vote 'no' to this one because we'll hold another referendum on constitutional recognition after this one. We'll hold another referendum.' And what do we find out today? The Leader of the Opposition is walking away from his own promise. He's walking away from his own view once again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The one thing that Australians have learnt over the course of this campaign regarding this referendum is that the Prime Minister is a man of his word and you cannot trust the Leader of the Opposition. He is sneaky. He is deceitful. You couldn't trust him as far as you could throw him. He has no policies and no solutions to this issue or the other issues that are important to the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government, the Albanese government, is about trying to get better results not only for First Nations Australians but for Australians more generally. We know that Australians didn't vote for constitutional change, but they didn't say no to closing the gap on Aboriginal disadvantage in this country, and that's what the government will continue to focus on. We'll work with First Nations Australians to achieve that for the good of the country, as we have been doing in other important policy areas. That's what this government really has all been about. It's about dealing with the issues and the challenges facing the Australian people at the moment and developing the policies to deal with those issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at some of the policies that the Albanese government has come up with and prioritised that have been opposed by those opposite. The focus of this government, which has been the focus of this government the whole way through, is the cost-of-living pressure and alleviating the cost-of-living pressure for many Australians. I speak of electricity bill relief. When we put electricity price caps in this country, what did those opposite do? They opposed it. When we introduced rebates to ensure that households had assistance to get through this difficult period, those opposite opposed it. When it comes to the issues that are affecting Australians, those opposite have no policies. Cheaper child care is a huge issue for families across Australia looking to be able to afford child care. This government came up with a policy to increase the rebate and remove the cap on hours, and as a result cheaper child care started on 1 July. It is providing real relief for families throughout the country. What did those opposite do? They opposed it. What is their alternative? None, no policy—no other policy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have increased assistance for the most vulnerable Australians. We have increase rent assistance and some of the other family assistance payments. We changed the qualifying period for single mums so that they can get more support from the government to get through this difficult period with cost-of-living pressure increasing. What have those opposite done? They've opposed it. We are increasing and tripling the rate of bulk-billing incentives to ensure that more people can get access to a GP across the country that is bulk-billed. Our urgent care clinics are another commitment that was promised by the government in the lead-up to the last election to take pressure off our emergency departments, and those clinics are being delivered. I am very fortunate that I have one of those urgent care clinics in my electorate. It is taking pressure off the Prince of Wales Hospital and ensuring that families can get access to the health care they need when they need it, from 8 am until 8 pm. All they need is their Medicare card. That is real action that is delivering better health care and better health services for Australians across the country, and once again it was opposed by those opposite. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have introduced fee-free TAFE places because we know we have skill shortages in a number of places across the country. The government's policy in the lead-up to the election was to offer fee-free TAFE to ensure that we have more Australians taking up apprenticeships and traineeships in areas where we have skill shortages. We are rolling out the program, and we are delivering that program particularly for younger Australians to get access to the education they need and, importantly, so that employers get access to the skills they deserve so that they can grow their businesses across this country. We know that housing is a huge issue for the Australian people at the moment. Many Australians are struggling with the cost of housing. Thankfully, the government's Housing Australia Future Fund recently passed the parliament and will now be starting to deliver relief in the form of additional supply in the Australian market. Once again, this was opposed by those opposite. We followed that up with a national approach to housing through National Cabinet, a new target to build 1.2 million well-located homes over five years from 1 July 2024, a national plan for reforming the way that planning and zoning are done throughout the states, a $3 billion new homes bonus to incentivise state governments to make the reforms necessary to get more homes built in areas where they are needed, securing a better deal for renters throughout the country and working with the states to deliver our help-to-buy policy, another commitment that was promised during the last election campaign and has now been delivered. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we are not stopping there. We are working with the states on the urgent issue of ensuring that we are building more social housing, and we are delivering a further $1 billion commitment to public and community housing throughout the country. These are some of the policies of this government, as well as getting wages moving again. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that those opposite don't want to see Australians' pay packets increase. They don't want to see that cost-of-living relief through the old hip pocket, delivered through work. No! They're opposing that as well. The Leader of the Opposition can come into this place and try to move this motion to distract Australians from the issues that they're facing at the moment. We know that Australians are facing cost-of-living pressure, and that's why we're focussed on these issues and have delivered these policies to assist Australians. I say to those opposite: what are your policies on any of these areas? I don't know what they are and the Australian people don't know what they are, because they haven't announced any! They do not have any policies to deal with the cost-of-living pressures that Australians are facing at the moment.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:04</span>):  As I said previously, I mourn for those families who have lost loved ones. This—and I'm not using it as a prop; I'm using it as a piece of evidence—is a notice of intention to hold a public assembly. It's a two-page document, it's available online and it's what should've been filled out when there was going to be a rally at Sydney Town Hall last week to stand up for—I use those terms very loosely—Palestine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The New South Wales Minister for Police and Counter-terrorism, Yasmin Catley, told the state parliament that the protest, at which flares were thrown and anti-Jewish hatred chanted—and I'm not going to repeat them now; we heard them from the opposition leader and we've seen them all too readily on our television screens, in our newspapers and on our radios in recent times—was a 'spontaneous gathering'. Yeah? Nah! I'm sorry; this was promoted, aided and abetted by the New South Wales Greens, and they stand condemned for their disgusting actions. Shame on them! But it didn't just stop there. If it had and they'd walked back from it, we could be forgiven for thinking they had made a mistake. And we all make mistakes. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that atrocities have been committed and innocent lives lost in the most barbaric ways in Israel. No-one should be supporting or celebrating this. No-one should be throwing flares and projectiles at the police. I'm so pleased that the New South Wales Police—they should not be criticised at all—made sure that there was the necessary staff for ensuing gatherings. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a motion in this place today brought by the Prime Minister, and I commend him for it. I applaud the opposition leader's words. I sent a text to the Deputy Prime Minister regarding for his eloquent speech on the motion before us—not on the amendment brought forward by the Leader of the Greens. When that amendment was rightfully lost, we then had the unedifying sight—though perhaps it wasn't so unedifying, because there was a show of solidarity from the fair-minded members of this parliament who sat on the government benches and voted for the proposal put forward by Prime Minister Albanese—of the Greens leader, the member for Melbourne, and the member for Brisbane, the member for Griffith and the member for Ryan, all Greens, voting against it and being rightly defeated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Faruqi is the Deputy Leader of the federal Greens. When this place was illuminated in blue and white in support of Israel, she tweeted, 'One colonial government supporting another. What a disgrace. #FreePalestine'. Then you have Jenny Leong, a New South Wales Greens parliamentarian, sending tweets that could only be described as disgraceful. I'm not going to read them, because it only promotes the cause they are promoting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also have to say that, if it is good enough for a secretary of the Public Service to stand aside because of a message he may or may not have put up on WhatsApp, then that should be good enough for a journalist who describes the beheading of Israeli children as 'BS' on a chat group with other media and then doubles down. If it's good enough for a secretary of the Public Service to be stood down, I would ask whether that person is still in his job. We need to be very careful when atrocities such as this occur. Women were having their phones and purses taken from them and then petrol was thrown on them and set alight, and in some instances their children were beheaded before them. And we've got people—leaders, journalists—making comments which are simply untrue. It's just beyond beyond. It defies logic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a friend reminded me this morning, it does not matter what side, innocent lives are being taken. Yes, these atrocities were caused and created by Hamas. It is a terrorist organisation, make no mistake. But not all Palestinians agree with the incursion and invasion and atrocities committed; they do not, and their feelings should be respected as well. Israel has to do what it must do to defend itself, and anyone who thinks otherwise is not being fair-minded. We do need a two-state solution to the Middle East conflict. It is simply not good enough that people are making statements of which they have no facts. They are using their hatred and their longstanding bias against Israel, and this is so unfortunate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the best moments I ever saw—and I notice that the member for Chifley has sat through a number of these speeches, and I asked him this morning if he was okay—in this parliament was when he, a Muslim, and the former minister for Kooyong, Josh Frydenberg, who is Jewish, whose parents fled from the Holocaust horrors of war-torn Europe—and I know the member for Chifley's parents also came to this country for a better life. They hugged each other after a rather terrible statement was made about Jews in the Senate by a senator, who thankfully is no longer in this place and whose name I won't even dignify by mentioning. We all know who he is. That should be how this parliament operates, and it was seen in a good light this morning when the Prime Minister made the motion and spoke to the motion. Others have stood up and addressed this motion, because it is important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should stand with Israel. Any deaths on either side, Israel or Palestine, should be abhorred. People have lost their lives, children's lives have been disrupted forever, and families have been torn apart. It's so terrible. I mourn with Israel.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="86256" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:13</span>):  I also grieve for those innocent Israelis, Palestinians and those from other nations who've lost their lives in the latest shocking atrocities in Israel and the occupied territories. The pain of those families who've lost loved ones in Israel and Gaza or who wait anxiously to hear of the fate of hostages from multiple countries across the world is profound. None of us can really know that. We can try and bear witness to it and acknowledge it and honour it, but it's not our pain to know.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Make no mistake: this is an utter tragedy for the innocent Israelis and innocent Palestinians, who are victims in this. What is happening now is a terrible, horrible situation, and I fear greatly for what will come in the days and weeks ahead and the potential for escalation of violence in Israel, Gaza and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territories and neighbouring countries. It is also horrific for the Australian Jewish and Muslim communities, distraught at the fate of loved ones, their brothers and sisters, and at the prospect of peace in this long-troubled region. The overwhelming majority of Australian Jews and Australian Muslims that I know are good people. They are good Australians who desperately want to see a just resolution to this conflict.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This parliament is right to condemn unreservedly the attack by terrorist group Hamas on innocent civilians. These murderous attacks were designed deliberately to provoke terror and international outrage. But one of the numerous tragic aspects of this attack, beyond the horrific and immediate impacts on human life, is that the actions of Hamas are not in the interests of Palestinians. Hamas's actions hamper efforts to achieve the two-state solution for which I and most Australians have long advocated, and I know that you Madam Deputy Speaker Vamvakinou, have been at the forefront of that effort for many years in this parliament. Australia has rightly condemned the attacks by Hamas, including indiscriminate rocket attacks fired on cities and civilians and the horrific taking of hostages. Hamas do not represent the interests of Palestinians and they do not care about human life. They do not care about the lives of Jewish people, whom they seek to slaughter. They do not care about the lives of the Palestinian people, whom they use as cannon fodder for their political aims. And they do not care about the lives of citizens of other countries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, saying that Hamas are a vile terrorist group in no way diminishes support for Palestinian statehood and a just settlement, and I acknowledge in particular the members of the opposition who've chosen not to play politics with this and to acknowledge that simple point. Saying this also in no way negates the legitimate criticisms over many years of the Israeli government's settlement policies and the occupation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All human life is sacred and innocent civilians should be protected. In that context, of course Israel has an inherent right to defend itself, and it should not be controversial to state that that right is not unfettered and does not and cannot justify any action or the indiscriminate mass killing of innocent Palestinians in response. Australia has consistently and loudly said that Israel must act within the rules of war. Australia has expressed a principled view that Israel and all actors should seek to protect civilian lives. The overwhelming feedback I've had from my community is the concern and the need to protect human life and ensure that Australia's response, along with that of the rest of the international community, equally values the lives of people in Gaza—innocent Palestinians—and of Israelis and their collective suffering and loss. I share this concern and, in doing so, I decry the gross politicisation of this tragedy by the Leader of the Opposition in a certain national broadsheet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An overwhelming message from my community now is despair and terror at what may be coming in the days and weeks ahead and a cry that the mass punishment of two million people in Gaza is not a proportionate response and that this is a trap that Israel must not fall into. It is what Hamas are trying to provoke. It seems clear that there is a geopolitical element to this organised attack by Hamas that has little to do with the conflict and occupation and much to do with regional geopolitics in Iran. I agree with the many speakers who have called out the nefarious and insidious impact of Iran.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The international community is right to expect that humanitarian aid will be allowed through and that innocent civilians will be protected, and I welcome the government's allocation of $10 million of additional and immediate humanitarian aid funding for the people of Gaza.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Antisemitism is to be utterly condemned, and the fear that the Australian Jewish community is now feeling is unacceptable. Antisemitism hurts us all, as we're a multicultural and proudly diverse nation. Islamophobia is corrosive and unacceptable and hurts us all. ASIO director-general Mike Burgess was right to call for calm in the Australian community, and responsible political leaders will heed this call. I'll continue to speak up for peace and a just resolution. I hope that all of us are guided by a common principle of a just and enduring peace, a negotiated two-state solution in which Israel and a future Palestinian state co-exist in peace and security within internationally recognised borders. Though that day sadly seems further away than before these attacks, we must never give up on peace.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:19</span>):  I want to acknowledge the contributions by just about everyone in this chamber. This isn't an easy time, and these aren't easy things to speak to. Often, through the day, we have been talking about images and events that are quite graphic. At some times, there were children visiting this place. That might have been hard for them, but that is what we do here: we stand up and we speak about things in tough times and we speak to communities to say, 'You're not alone.' There are many Australians who are looking for comfort because they are scared right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jewish people should feel safe in Australia. Jewish people should feel safe in Israel. Indeed, it's why it exists. This wasn't just an attack on the sovereignty of a nation. It wasn't just an incursion across a border. It was an attack on the sovereignty of people's homes. Families were in their places of refuge, in their places of comfort and in their places of the most significant joy. The doors that they walked through after they were first married, the doors that they walked through when they brought their children home from a hospital became the doors that saw terror enter their homes, and none of us can imagine what those moments were like. They weren't just filled with unwanted attacks and murder. Where there was time, they were filled with the worst imaginable torture, and the torture wasn't just reserved for the man of the house. It was also for the mothers, the grandmothers—some of whom were Holocaust survivors—the children and the babies. That's where some of the most unimaginable acts of human torture happened, in 2023. In this time, in this age, with all of the modern technologies and advancements we have, this happened on our planet on our watch.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many have said, 'Protect your loved ones from the images that are on social media,' and we must do that. But for those of us who are adults and are in places of responsibility, like here, we should look at them. We should look at what terror actually is and what actually happened, because, when you look at what was deliberately planned and executed, you realise this was no normal event. It is not hyperbole to say this was Israel's September 11 moment. When you look at the proportion of deaths to the population, it was worse, and, like September 11, it left a mark that will echo through the decades. It impacted my life, halfway around the world. This will echo through the decades for Israel, for Jewish people and maybe for all of the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other members have been right to point out that this wasn't just about Hamas and that particular border crossing point and the destruction they caused. There are regional and global strategic interests at play as well. Those things will play out in due course. But we mustn't look away. When we don't look away, we see the horror of children who weren't just executed; their burnt bodies were found lined up with their hands tied behind their backs. Of all the horrors that happened in the Holocaust and the scale of that, this form of death is even worse. And it happened in 2023—not in 1943 but in 2023. Children were killed in their cots. In the aftermath, family pets were sitting on the beds where their family had been. If they could talk, they'd say, 'I let you down.' For fathers and mothers, we can only imagine that, as they did everything they could to save and shield their children, they also thought: 'What have I done? My God, I've let my family down.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think of the father who gave an interview on Al Jazeera or the BBC. I think he was a man with an English accent; he may have been born in Ireland. He let his daughter Emily go to a sleepover. Emily was only eight. For a few days he didn't know where Emily was or what had happened to her, and, when he was told that Emily was killed, he jumped with joy. He was so relieved because, for him, that was better than what he thought would happen if she were taken hostage in Gaza, because by then he had seen and heard of the torture and inhumanity that had happened to his neighbours and others in the kibbutz. Just stop and think about that: a father feeling joy that death for his eight-year-old at a sleepover was better than the alternative.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We mustn't forget the images of children and women being taken hostage. That was a deliberate act. That's part of what's coming next. We saw the images of a young girl with bloodied clothes being dragged by her hair from the boot into the side of a car. We saw the grotesque images posted of Hamas holding young children and a baby in a pram. That image is designed to cause terror and fear. And then the threat not only to execute the hostages but to broadcast it, to publish it—that's the worst fear imaginable. That is why the comparisons with ISIS are absolutely right. But, again, Hamas is probably even worse because of the scale of the attacks and the scale of the terror. Hamas is not only an enemy of Israel; it's an enemy of the world and it's an enemy of the people of Gaza. Other members are right to point out that this act of terror isn't just an end in itself. It is designed to provoke a reaction and it is designed to see retribution, and they have designed it in a way that the legitimate military targets are put in places where civilians are. Those are decisions that Hamas are making. None of us who say, 'Israel has a right to defend itself,' will take any joy or any pleasure with what's coming next. No reasonable person would look forward to that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think of the many families in Australia who have relatives who are reservists, who signed up and did their training in the Israeli Defence Forces and who have now been called up. In the coming days, weeks and months, many of them will die. That will happen. And those families are living with that fear and apprehension right now. I'm thinking of the families of the hostages who are there. There's potentially some hope, some way that they can be saved, and if there's any humanity in Gaza, any humanity in Hamas, please do everything you can to see them released. Even just some of them, just the children and the babies—let them go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In July, I was on one of three parliamentary delegations that left from this place with members from across the aisle and went on various trips to Israel and Palestine. On my particular trip we went throughout Israel, but I remember being in Sderot, in the north-eastern border town near Gaza. We were shown a playground where bunkers were turned into a snake that children would feel free to play in. I keep thinking that many of the children who played in that are no longer with us anymore and many of those children who played in that playground are now hostages in Gaza.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know it's unparliamentary to refer to members' names, but I want to single out some of the Jewish members in parliament here: Mark Dreyfus, Julian Leeser and Josh Burns. It has been particularly hard for them, as well as for some of the Victorian state members: Paul Hamer, who overlaps with my seat, and David Southwick. This is particularly hard on that community, and I acknowledge that it is hard on the Palestinian community here, too, and on members who have relatives in Gaza. That has been put well by other members.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge the North Eastern Jewish Centre in my electorate and I want to thank the Community Security Group in Melbourne, who are working around the clock to keep the Melbourne Jewish community safe. I want to thank you, and say that we're thinking of you and are here for you.</span>

I often say of the electorate I represent that it is one with many challenges, but one of incredible possibility. Last week I was in India, describing our community to civic leaders and politicians there. To describe it best, I cut to our schools, where children from over 100 countries can be seen at school assemblies, sitting side by side, shoulder to shoulder. These children and their families, our civil institutions and leaders work hard every day to build a cohesive, multicultural, multifaith and multilingual society: a pocket of Melbourne's west that the world will look to as a great multicultural community. It's where the world comes together to build a strong, compassionate and collaborative society—a community built on respect, where we can look one another in the eye and have difficult conversations in trusted ways.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the elected representative of that community here, I stand to condemn the attacks by Hamas in Israel 10 days ago. World events are, very naturally, discussed in my community, as there will be a personal take, a family connection or the deep knowledge of a place which people have come from. My community is not home to a large Jewish community but it is home to a large global community, and it was rocked last week by the news from Israel. We were shocked by the violence, the loss of life and the hostage-taking, and aghast at the actions of Hamas. I join with all those in this House today to condemn the actions of Hamas. These were motivated by hate, but I also want to separate the actions of Hamas from the people of Gaza and the people of a future Palestine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to join other voices to acknowledge that the attack has set back hopes for the two-state solution that would allow both Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace inside safe and internationally recognised borders. That knowledge is deeply understood in my electorate; it is deeply understood in my community. I rise because in my community, across a weekend when we in Australia went out to have our democratic say on a debate, we walked past one another respectfully and took things from one another before we went in to vote. While that was going on, members of my community were emailing me, holding their breath for fear of what was going to come to the people of Palestine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have worked with young people all my life. I have supported them in building cohesive communities and helped them to understand why we have rules, and that rules are there to protect them. Many in my community have emailed me across this weekend. While we conducted a referendum, while we used our democratic decision-making processes, locals took time to reach out to me to express their fears for the innocent civilians; for those already lost in attacks and those lost already inside Gaza, where two million civilians live. So I also join calls today for respect for the rule of law, for international law.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I work with young people, I always talk to them about what happens when conversations stop, hatred takes over and violence becomes a part of our community. Hate begets hate; anger begets anger. I ask my community to join in the hope that we can still find a peaceful solution here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome the commitment made by the Australian government: $10 million of aid to support the humanitarian assistance. That will provide much needed essential supplies and support services for civilians affected by the conflict in Gaza. I call for safe and unimpeded humanitarian access to civilians affected by the worsening humanitarian crisis. I add that we are committed to the pursuit of peace and a just and enduring two-state solution where Palestinians and Israelis can live within those secure borders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge my community and communities across Australia to remain respectful and to strongly condemn anyone who incites violence and hatred in our community. While we respect the right of anyone in Australia to protest peacefully, violence is unacceptable. I encourage families, friends and communities to contact authorities for help and advice if they become aware of indications that an individual or group may be planning to resort to violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other members of this House have detailed the horrific cases of antisemitism that have been seen in the last week. They are shocking and they are wrong. But I also want to condemn white supremacists and Neo-Nazis who have committed acts of cowardice and bastardry before and after the recent outbreak of conflict in the Middle East, because my community are already talking about the Islamophobia that they're interacting with in the broader community in Melbourne. Just as antisemitism has no place in our country, neither does Islamophobia, abusing women in hijabs through verbal attacks nor denying girls in a hijab an Uber ride.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia prides itself on being the most successful multicultural nation on earth. I represent a community that is living that every day, and I want to say to the people in my community: we have a cohesive community. We can have these conversations, but we have to have them respectfully. In times of conflict, what we need to do here in Australia is to be the voice of reason. To be that voice of reason on the world stage, we need to be that voice of reason at home, around our kitchen tables and in our classrooms. I want to send a message to all the teachers in classrooms across my community, because these issues will be live in those classrooms. Unlike some opposite, I don't want to see footage. I don't want to hear details about atrocities—maybe it's because I'm a woman—because it hurts me too deeply. I want to ask teachers to be careful in their classrooms, to monitor the conversations that are happening about this conflict and to monitor closely to ensure that children aren't sharing details or footage of violent atrocities with one another. I want to ensure that they are in a safe space where conversations about this conflict, if they are happening, are done in respectful ways.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="288713" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BIRRELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Nicholls</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:38</span>):  I join with my parliamentary colleagues in my unreserved condemnation of the attacks on southern Israel by Hamas. These are brutal acts by people who have completely lost all sense of humanity. What we've seen reported out of southern Israel has been horrific and shocking. It brings emotions of anger and sadness to think that civilians can be targeted in such a way and that innocent children can be treated with such inhumanity and barbarity. It's really difficult to put into words what type of response any decent person would have to such an attack.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's so difficult to see hatred and intolerance flourish in any part of the world. In times like this I try to look back to my own community. The previous speaker talked about a successful example of multiculturalism, and the electorate of Nicholls is certainly that. I would like to share with the parliament something that happened last week, a vigil at the St Brendan's Catholic Church in Shepparton, which is my hometown in the centre of the electorate of Nicholls. At the vigil people from all different religions came together to pray and to reflect on what was happening in Israel. I was fortunate enough to speak, as were other members of parliament. The two people who organised it and the people who spoke were young people driven by faith and driven by a sense of wanting to see peace in their community. One of them was the new Catholic parish priest in Shepparton, Father Jackson Saunders, and the other was his friend and the new imam of the Albanian mosque in Shepparton, Imam Hysni Merja. The Albanian mosque was built in 1960, and it's a part of our community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are young people driven by faith to come together. They're from different religious traditions and faiths, but they prayed in their own way together for peace. It was a bright moment in what was a very dark week. I was asked to speak, and, as I said earlier, it's difficult to find the words to talk about such barbarity. I tried to go back to the values that I expressed in my maiden speech, which were that we seem to do better as a society when we celebrate each other's culture but moreover focus on our shared humanity, the humanity being a stronger bond than any differences that seek to be amplified by race, ethnicity, gender or religion. The way that the Goulburn Valley does that and that many other parts of Australia do that means that our humanity is strong and our connection is strong. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's so shameful to see that connection breaking down in other parts of Australia. Some of the chants that I heard on the steps of the Sydney Opera House were an absolute disgrace, and those people making them are un-Australian. We have to call that out continually because that is not the Australia that we want. We have to hold onto our humanity, and there are examples of that in the Goulburn Valley, in my electorate of Nicholl.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have connections with Israel. Before coming into this place, I worked as an agronomist or agricultural scientist with a water company called Netafim. I visited Sderot, which is one of the towns that was most affected by this unspeakable brutality. There are other southern kibbutzim and towns that have been affected, including a Hatzerim, a kibbutz near Bathsheba which has the Netafim factory. I'll just reflect that these kibbutzim sustain themselves by world-leading water technology, mostly for agriculture, which is what I was involved in. They are sustained by this aspiration for technology to give life to communities throughout the world. There are obviously examples of this Israeli technology not only in Australia but in Africa, Asia, North and South America and Europe. It helps efficiently and with reverence to the environment to grow more food for people, which is life. That's life, and, for people working on such life-giving technology and devoting their lives to making sure that the globe has enough food to be attacked by people who have this obsession with death, makes it even harder to bear. My own experiences and my friendships and people who I'm still in contact with who I used to work with are going through a terrible time as a result.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The depravity and evil of Hamas knows no bounds, it would seem, with what they have done by taking hostages, including children, back into Gaza and by what they're doing by using the innocent civilians of Palestine, as it would seem, as human shields. There's going to be a great deal of tragedy in the coming weeks and months. We need to acknowledge that too. We absolutely need to acknowledge that too. I think it's incredibly cowardly to use children and innocent civilians as cover for your own hateful, violent ways. I'm so regretful that there wasn't leadership in that particular Palestinian territory that didn't look at some of the other societies around the world that have flourished with economic activity, education, community and society. Gaza could have been that, but Hamas wouldn't allow it. So I join, as I said at the beginning of this, with my parliamentary colleagues in condemning this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just focus on what makes Australia a great community, like the Imam from the Albanian mosque, Father Jackson from the Catholic Church and other faith leaders at that event. I single them out because they're young men who are hopefully going to be in our community for their lives, spreading messages of peace with communities of different faiths coming together. Let's focus on what we have here; let's condemn the hatred and barbarity we see around the world and reflect on what we do in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have arguments in this place, but we've got a great democracy and we've got a great social fabric. But that has to be fought for. As part of the fight for it, you've got to call out evil when you see it and you've got to call out hatred and intolerance when you see it. We saw it in Sydney, regretfully, and I called that out as well as condemning the evil attacks of Hamas on the south of Israel.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr FREELANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:48</span>):  Everyone who's spoken on this motion has spoken with incredibly moving words. For me this is a very important subject. I'm Jewish. I can trace my ancestry in this country on both sides back many generations. I don't have many Holocaust survivors or their descendants in my family. Some of my relatives came out here as convicts. They've contributed to Australia in many ways. I've always been proud to call myself Jewish. One of my grandfathers founded the Emanuel temple in Woollahra in the eastern suburbs of Sydney. My ancestor, Abraham Rubin, founded the first permanent synagogue in Australia—one that is still functioning in Hobart. It's been there for hundreds of years. We are proud of our history in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a child growing up, Israel was a country that we as a Jewish family were proud of. It was the one place in the world where Jewish people from all corners could seek sanctuary. Australia had a large part in the founding of Israel, through Doc Evatt, who was later to be Labor leader.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Tuesday I attended a vigil with the Jewish community in Sydney. Many people spoke, and they all spoke very meaningfully and very movingly. The most moving part was the recitation of the prayers for the dead by Rabbi Ben Elton because that brought home the horrors that have been forced upon Israel by Hamas, the most evil of terrorist organisations. It brought home the children that had died, ripped from their families' arms, the young mothers, the grandmothers, the fathers and the young people ambushed at, of all things, a music festival. It brought home the horrors that Hamas had visited upon Israel. The prayers for the dead brought that home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are children and young adults who will never fulfil their potential and fathers who will never see their children grow up or see their grandchildren. Those horrors were inflicted upon people who were going about their lives peacefully. These were not army veterans. These were not fighters. These were everyday people like you and me, gunned down without any way to protect themselves. It's absolutely horrible. Hamas have opened the gates of hell, which was their intention. This was clearly planned. Clearly this was a way of getting Israel to react, and, unfortunately, it will lead to the further deaths of innocent people—Jews, Palestinians and others—in the most horrible, horrible way. I congratulate our Prime Minister for his response and the New South Wales Premier for his response as well and all decent people responding to support Israel's right to exist.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not particularly religious, but it seems to me that what Hamas has done has broken every moral rule that we can live by. As I've said, my family have lived in this country for many generations, and what happened on the footsteps of the Opera House in Sydney recently, where people were chanting, 'Death to the Jews,' and, 'Gas the Jews,' is something that I never thought I would ever see in this country. It's something that I am, as a Sydneysider, deeply ashamed of, and I hope the people that were responsible for that are brought to justice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a paediatrician, I have treated children of every colour and every creed. The one thing I never ask people is their religion. It has nothing to do with any medical treatment, and I have always treated people equally, as they have treated me. I've looked after Muslim families, Buddhist families, Jewish families, Catholic families and others and treated them the same. That is why I can also grieve for the many innocent Palestinians who are going to lose their lives in this conflagration, and that's what it is. It is very hard to see an end to it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst I've always believed that peace is possible, as we did eventually see peace in Northern Ireland, it is very hard to see the road to peace from now, and it's important to understand that, whilst Hamas does not represent even the majority of the Palestinians, what they have done has been deliberate. They have destroyed any chance of peace—certainly, in the near future—and they have also opened the Israel-Palestine conflict to a wider audience. I hope very much that we don't see the further involvement of Iran or of Hezbollah in Lebanon, although I think that is very likely. This is going to be a conflict that will not have any short-term ending.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Israel has a right to exist—I have believed that as long as I have been alive—and Israel has the right to protect itself. People will die and children will die, in all likelihood, and that is just abhorrent to me. I hope that some way can be found to end this conflict as soon as possible, and I hope that the number of people who die will be kept to an absolute minimum. I grieve for every one of them. I grieve for all the families that have lost people in this conflict already—Israelis, Palestinians, Americans, Thais, Germans and Australians. This is an act of complete evil by an evil group, and what they have done has the potential to cause many thousands more deaths.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Israel will protect itself, but we also need to understand that in this conflict the Palestinians will be victims just as much as the Israelis. It is very important that Australia does what it can to support the refugees—to support people in Israel and in Palestine—and through the United Nations helps to bring this conflict to an end as soon as possible. I grieve for all those people; I grieve for the families, I grieve for the loss for the chance of peace and I grieve for the trauma that many people, particularly in the Jewish and Palestinian communities in Australia, are going through. I have always been a strong supporter of Israel, although I don't support all the actions of the Israeli government. It's important that Israel is allowed to defend itself, but I just hope that this conflict can be brought to an end with minimal further loss of life. I know the particular hell that the families who have members who are hostages must be going through. I hope that we can do all we can to help those hostages to be released unharmed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What the Australian government has done is very important, and I congratulate the Prime Minister on his actions. But I fear that this is a conflict which may continue for some time.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:58</span>):  In the dying days of the Second World War, the senior leadership of the Schutzstaffel, or the SS, from Himmler down, attempted to conceal the evidence of the Holocaust—their crimes and the murders of six million Jewish people throughout the parts of Europe that they had conquered. They exhumed bodies to incinerate them so that the evidence of the bodies would not exist. They attempted to destroy the crematoriums and the gas chambers at certain sites of the concentration camps, because they knew that what they had done would bring upon them, and a war they were about to lose, enormous consequences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We never thought that we could talk about a category of people that have a lower moral code than the Nazis, and yet that is what we're dealing with, with Hamas. Hamas would say to the Nazis, 'Why aren't you proud of the six million Jews that you killed?' The attitude of Hamas would be to celebrate the killing and the attempt to exterminate an entire race of people. So we have a situation where an awful terrorist attack has been committed against innocent people, and, regrettably, it is couched in the circumstance of ongoing antisemitism on a scale that I had hoped—and believed—was no longer present in the modern world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a teenager I visited the Dachau concentration camp with my father. I think I was about 17 or 18 years old. If you have ever visited a concentration camp, you will know that it is a life-changing experience. It was probably the most significant and important as well as the most poignant part of my education and awakening and awareness of the world—what the world was and what humanity could be at its worst. One of the takeaways of that experience was that at least that happened so long ago and at least the lesson of the Holocaust was so significant that humanity would never even countenance the concept of anything similar to that ever again. Then, in 2023, in my own country that I love, I see Australians protesting and chanting things like, 'Gas the Jews.' I hear Australians calling for another Holocaust, Australians calling for a genocide and Australians celebrating the death of people because of their faith and religion, particularly celebrating the fact that Jews have been killed in a terrorist attack undertaken by one of the most vile and disgraceful organisations on the planet—as I say, one with a lower moral code than that of the Schutzstaffel, which at least tried to conceal its murder of the Jews. We have Hamas talking about promoting, publishing and filming the execution of Jews—people who have been kidnapped who are currently alive. They plan to take their lives, and promote it, publicise it, celebrate it and cheer for it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Chanting 'Gas the Jews'  was one of the lowest things I've ever seen in this country until, regrettably, this morning when I saw the behaviour of the Australian Greens in response to a motion related to the condemnation of a terrorist attack against innocent civilians. I've served in this parliament for a little over four years and, to be honest, I could be convinced of a lot of things that it would surprise me could happen in this chamber. That we in this chamber would come together as a parliament to condemn terrorism and that someone elected to serve in the House of Representatives would seek to amend that condemnation in any way—to qualify it—and then proceed to vote against that motion of condemnation of a terrorist atrocity that has killed already more than 1,200 people is absolutely shameful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just note that there was an attempt by the Greens to remove this statement from that motion: 'That this House stands with Israel and recognises its inherent right to defend itself.' According to the Australian Greens, they don't support that. Let's reflect on that as a principle. What the Greens are saying is that, if this country were the victim of a terrorist attack and 1,200 Australians were killed in that terrorist attack, it would be the position of the Australian Greens that this country, this government and the defence forces of this nation should have no response to that. Holding that view is absolutely treasonous. For people to think that they can serve in the House of Representatives and take a position in this parliament effectively condoning terrorist activity, condoning murder, and refusing to support a motion that should, beyond question, have had the complete unanimity of this chamber, on a question of complete moral clarity—the murder of innocent people, and the right for a sovereign nation to defend itself from its citizens being murdered—is utterly appalling. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm ashamed of the conduct of the people that voted against the motion in this chamber today. I never believed for a second, given the great pride and honour I have in serving in the House of Representatives of the Australian parliament, that I would ever feel a sense of shame because of the conduct of fellow members of this chamber—the position the Greens party took this morning. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My heart goes out to my Jewish constituents and all Jewish Australians who are touched personally and directly by this. There are so many Australians who have relatives, family members and loved ones that have been victims, either murdered or kidnapped, and countless others who have family in Israel, some of whom are serving in the Israeli defence force. Anyone in Israel right now is living in fear of potentially falling victim to further terrorist atrocities. I equally feel for my constituents of Palestinian heritage who have innocent family members that may be at risk of or have already succumbed to something that is entirely the responsibility of the Hamas terrorist organisation. The perverseness of these people is that, as it stands, the actions of Hamas have currently resulted so far in the death of more Palestinian people than Israeli people. That is the moral code of these butchers and their bloodlust. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We as a nation have to be united, strident and utterly uncompromising when it comes to condemning what has happened. We all want peace. I despair for what the future holds, as other speakers have pointed out. But this conflict is only going to escalate, and it all started with the actions of one of the most evil organisations to ever exist on the face of the planet. I lament the setback for peace. But Hamas do not want peace. They want the complete destruction of every Jewish person, as they chant, from the river to the sea.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I express my deepest condolences to everyone that has been touched by this. Any of us that have families and loved ones think in horror about what happened to those poor, innocent victims and imagine if that had happened to our own families and loved ones.</span>

We offer our prayers to those who are held hostage and call for their immediate release. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wholeheartedly condemn Hamas's acts of pure evil from a terrorist organisation. I stand with the people of Israel. The Albanese government stands with the people of Israel during this difficult period. We certainly recognise that Israel has the right to defend itself and its people during this bloody conflict. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As soon as we heard the news of the Hamas attack on the Israeli people, the Prime Minister called the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Our foreign minister spoke to the Israeli foreign minister and our defence minister spoke to the Israeli ambassador and offered the support of the Australian people and the assistance of the Australian government to the people of Israel during this difficult period. Today the Prime Minister outlined the support that is being provided by the Australian government, both the logistical support and the humanitarian support that will flow in the coming days.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very proud to represent a community that has a wonderful Jewish population. They are great Australian citizens who contribute to the community that we're fortunate to live in. On Friday evening I spent time at Mount Sinai, the Maroubra shule and the Coogee shule to express my support and solidarity with Jewish members of our community and the people of Israel. On Saturday, I was with the Hakoah football club prior to their game at Heffron Park, again to express my support for Jewish members of our community. I want them to know that I stand with them and that the Australian government stands with them during this difficult time. I also recognise that, unfortunately, many members of Australia's Jewish community have been the subject of some horrific and shocking antisemitic behaviour over the past week. Such behaviour stands condemned. There is no place—no place at all at any time—for antisemitism here in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia prides itself on being a proudly multicultural nation, a nation that has made a success of multiculturalism because of a culture of respect, diversity and understanding of people of different cultural, ethnic and religious backgrounds. We celebrate the fact that in our homes we speak about 200 different languages, we boast about 180 different ancestries and we practise many different religions and theologies, but we do so in an environment of peace, respect and goodwill. That is what characterises Australia. That is part of the fabric of our nation. Over the past week, that multiculturalism has been tested. All Australians have an obligation to uphold those values of respect and inclusivity in Australian society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government is doing all it can to ensure that Australians who are in Israel and surrounding territories and wish to return home get the support they need to do that. A number of repatriation flights have occurred or are occurring as we speak. The Australian Defence Force has deployed a number of planes to transport people out of flashpoint areas and potential conflict zones, and Qantas, of course, is assisting with that repatriation. I encourage any Australians who have loved ones who are still in the area and wish to return home to contact Smartraveller and the Department of Foreign Affairs as soon as possible to get information regarding those repatriation flights. The government will continue to provide that support for as long as it is needed to get Australians and their loved ones home as quickly as possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Australians have been affected by this issue over the course of the last week, and I implore all members of the community that I represent and wider Australia to remember the success that we've made of multiculturalism and remember what a virtue that is for our nation. Remain respectful of people of diverse backgrounds at all times. Any violence will be condemned and anyone undertaking violence will be prosecuted under Australian law. Now is not the time for division and hate. Now is the time for unity and respect. We call on all Australians to show that respect for each other during this difficult period and to look out for family, friends, loved ones and those of different cultures and faiths. Particularly, we express our support and our love for members of Australia's Jewish community during this difficult time. I, again, offer the support of my office in the community that I represent and am very proud to continue to work with the Jewish community in the area of Kingsford-Smith.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New England</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:15</span>):  Flectere si nequeo superos Acheronta movebo. What precisely does that mean? In a very brief summary, it means: if you can't affect heaven, affect hell—change hell—with 'Acheron' being the river, like the River Styx, which Charon carried people across to take them to the underworld. You've got to concentrate on affecting heaven. You've got to concentrate on the process of abiding by your higher angels, abiding by the better instincts, abiding by the mechanism of dispute in a form that is not this ritualistic, nihilistic, outrageous appropriation that we saw Hamas, a terrorist organisation—I was Deputy Chair of the National Security Committee when we made it a terrorist organisation—partake in the other day. This achieves nothing except retribution. It achieves nothing except retribution. In that retribution, unfortunately, innocent people will be killed. That becomes yet another profanity on top of what Hamas did.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you think about it, who gave the order to behead children? Who was the commanding officer who decided that was an appropriate order to give? Who was the commanding officer who decided an appropriate order was to murder people at a dance festival—youths, people in their early 20s, celebrating peace, basically your greatest advocates to try and move an agenda forward? Who gave that order? Who is it that evil man? Who is that evil person who decided to do that? Who was the commanding officer who said, 'You must murder parents. You must shoot them as they protect their babies.' Who was the evil man who gave that order? Who is that person? Evil, where do you reside? Where do you reside? Why do you wake up and decide that that is the purpose of your life—this outrage? Who was the evil man who said it was appropriate to murder a woman and then have other people spit on her dead body and parade it through Gaza? Who was that evil man? To what fathomless depth could a person, a human being, decide that that was appropriate? Why do that? Who was the evil person who said, 'Kidnap people. Kidnap them. Bring them back across the border, and then, at a time, we will murder them and put it on social media'? This is an outrage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What happens when you sow that seed, Hamas? What happens? You reap the wind. Now, it is unfortunate—not every Palestinian is in Hamas, but every Palestinian is going to be affected by this. There are people now, innocent people, who are going to be killed. A bomb will drop on a house. A family will die. Children will die. War is an outrageous, disgusting thing. I can say that, as a former serving member of the Australian Defence Force. We serve because we don't want wars, not because we do. Yet these evil men have decided to bring this to fruition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing about evil is that you never know where it ends. It is the ultimate Pandora's box, isn't it? You open the box and you don't know what happens next. We don't know what the next step is. We know what is happening. We know that the US are moving aircraft carriers closer to the coast. We know that Hezbollah are in the Bekaa Valley and are trying to open up a second front. We know the Iranians are now planning—does Hamas honestly believe that this will help the Palestinian people? Does Hamas honestly believe that this is a better outcome for the people in the Gaza Strip and the people in the West Bank? Do they understand the retribution and the dragons and the filth that is war that they have now launched on innocent people?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what do we do next? What do we do next? How do we do this? We can't possibly condone what Hamas did. They force us into one position, which is to say, 'You are evil people, you have done an evil act, and consequences must flow from this.' But we hope that this issue is resolved, which means finalised, which means that the appropriate outcome is reached, which means that the structure of this evil organisation that is Hamas is disassembled. But we hope and we pray that this happens with the least amount of innocent lives lost from this point forward. And I'm not alone in that. That's also Secretary Blinken's position—the least amount of innocent lives lost. When you have good people, and 99.9 per cent of the world are good people, and you put them in the same room, a Palestinian and a Jew—they're decent people—do you know what? They'll talk to each other. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own life, I've had strong connections—besides being very sympathetic to Palestine, very sympathetic. On the Northern Ireland issue, which is on another side of my family, from talking to people in Northern Ireland about what happened in Northern Ireland and trying to be involved in that discussion, the wisest thing that was said to me was by a cousin. He said, 'Yes, there are issues here, but it is not worth one drop of human blood, and people who kill people, Barnaby, are criminals.' And isn't it a beautiful thing that that greater angel, that better angel, rises above the filth and says, 'Just treat human beings with dignity; just be a better person'?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, please do not bring your rubbish into this great egalitarian nation. You are absolutely within your rights to raise concerns that you may have on certain issues—100 per cent within your rights to raise concerns that you may have. But you have no right to vomit out this filth that we have heard. That is not Australia. When you come to Australia, no matter how many generations you may have been here, as part of this nation you sign a contract that you will abide by the egalitarian principles of this nation: 'I will participate in the debate, but I will treat with respect even a person who has the opposite opinion to me. I will respect their humanity. I will respect their equivalence. I will respect their right to live.' I was so disturbed by some of the issues that have come to the fore with this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I hope and pray that innocent people are not killed. I hope and pray that the criminality which is Hamas is dealt with expediently and quickly without the unnecessary loss of other lives. And I hope and pray that the egalitarian nation of Australia is never adulterated.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people; indeed, it undermines Palestinian needs and aspirations. What happened on 7 October was an attack on the values shared by democratic and peaceful nations, including Australia. Such acts of terror are an affront to everything that Australians hold dear. A vicious cycle of violence now threatens to consume an entire region, ruining the lives of millions more innocent Israelis and innocent Palestinians alike. We can't stand by. I note the announcement by the Prime Minister that Australia will provide an initial $10 million in humanitarian assistance for civilians affected by this conflict, with $3 million going to the International Commission of the Red Cross to fund urgent needs, like restoring essential services and providing medical support. Through UN agencies, another $7 million will deliver critical support, like emergency water, nutrition, sanitation and hygiene services, as well as child protection.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now, closer to home, we recognise that emotions are raw. There will be many Australians who are deeply affected by this conflict and horrified by the conditions faced by those in affected areas. Many have friends or family in Israel or in Gaza. Many are scared and concerned for the future of family and friends in their homes in the region. Those who have returned or who will return from the affected areas will need help and support. I am proud of the efforts of my department in helping to facilitate the departure of around 1,200 Australians and their families from Israel, principally, and also from the occupied Palestinian territories. Work is underway to seek assistance for those Australians currently in Gaza; the foreign minister is working closely with international partners to try to secure safe passage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More broadly, it's more important now than ever before that the community stays in touch with loved ones and support services. And it's more important now than ever before that Australians support each other. In times of crisis, the Australian community is at its very best when we come together. I see my role and responsibility as working to reinforce these best angels in our communities. I recognise the support that our diverse communities provide to each other through times of adversity as one of our greatest strengths. I recognise too that we are a great multicultural nation—a nation of diversity but also of inclusion. Of course, it's common for those in this place to say that we have built the world's most successful multicultural society—and I agree. People of different faiths, languages and ethnicities have come to know Australia as a place where everyone belongs, where people can live alongside each other in peace and harmony. But we can't take this for granted; recent events have shown us this. Everyone in this country must feel safe and they must feel free to express who they are.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In that light, of course, we respect the right of anyone to protest peacefully, but violence and hate will not be tolerated—ever. Words matter; there is no place in this country or in society for hate or prejudice of any kind. There's no place for antisemitism, there's no place for Islamophobia and there's no place for racism. At times like these we should work to draw on our strengths as a multicultural society in a country where everyone belongs. We should work to be united and we should not let those who seek to divide us do us harm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should not let those who seek to divide us do us all harm. As our security agency said last week—and this bears repeating—it's important that all of us 'consider the implications for social cohesion when making public statements'. Words matter. As a government, and I hope as a parliament, we're all working hard to strengthen social cohesion across the country. That's where my focus is right now. Firstly, by working closely with our multicultural interfaith groups, listening with intent— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="124514" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms McKENZIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  I rise to speak tonight to address the painful process we as Australians have all been through in the Voice to Parliament referendum. This weekend past, not one state supported the referendum. Only the ACT voted for it, perhaps in an expression of regret that no Australian public service has yet managed to make any real and enduring impact on closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous outcomes in this country. Most Labor-held seats rejected the Voice, including that of the Minister for Indigenous Australians, which means that she not only did not understand the mood of the nation but did not understand her own constituents. The Voice was equally lost in all seats and states represented by the Indigenous members of parliament in this place. I do not know whether the Prime Minister has any idea of what he did to this country; his words on Saturday night indicated he might not. 'We will do better,' he seemed to suggest, but it was obvious to all that he could have done better from day one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the week the Prime Minister announced the proposed words for the referendum, I met with representatives of the Australians for Indigenous Constitutional Recognition, Rachel Perkins and Tony Nutt. You do not get two people of better will, intent, hope and indeed expertise in telling our nation's stories to itself, albeit in vastly different contexts. It was with a sullen soul that I told them that day that, now that we have seen the words that will be put to the Australian people, we will have no choice; the Prime Minister has put the Constitution and the Westminster system of government on the line for an apparent whim and prayer. For that is what it was for most Australians: a message of hope and heart, from which the head was sorely lacking. Had better brains been applied to the task, the Prime Minister would have seen that, at a minimum, a proper constitutional convention was necessary, in line with what we have done when referenda have been attempted in the past—not just to raise awareness for the need for change but also to ensure that the proposed change had its supporters, advocates, narrators and champions from all walks of life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead, the Prime Minister threw the country neck-deep into a debate marked by scorn and spite. I watched as my words of gratitude towards those who had met with me and given me time so that I could understand their lived experience and their deeply felt hope that things could be done better were turned into barbs, with assertions that I had used them to bolster the 'no' case. My words had been an expression of gratitude for what were important and challenging conversations which rigorously tested my instinctive constitutional conservatism and my conscience. You do not get better people than those who contribute to our local Indigenous groups in Flinders, like Living Culture and Willum Warrain. You do not get better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the time, one of the prominent elders in my community wrote me a letter of thanks for how I'd addressed the issue in this place, and for months I kept this safe from others to protect him from the near gravity-defying, twisted interpretations of well-meaning acts by activists in the 'yes' camp. The good news is this perversion of will and intent was the exception rather than the rule in Flinders. Most people, the vast majority, participated in the referendum with respect and kindness to one another. I thank the 'yes' volunteers who demonstrated the cheering bonhomie that is shared by passionate and opposing advocates at election time. I thank the 'no' volunteers in Flinders, some of whom brought to their advocacy their direct lived experience in Indigenous communities and their deep desire to see things improved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, I feel for those who I know are in pain, people for whom this meant so much, like Dean Parkin and Mark Textor who, together with my longstanding friends and mentors Julian Leeser and Greg Craven, kept calm grace by their side as much as was humanly possible. I am filled with esteem and awe for my colleagues Jacinta Price and Kerrynne Liddle and their fellow campaigner Warren Mundine, who, together with their families, endured months of hate and fury doing what they knew in their gut was right. We owe it to them, just as we owe it to my constituents in Flinders who desperately want to see us address wrongs past, to use the mechanisms we have, to listen more closely and more keenly, and to shape more responsibly and to explain more completely the decisions we make in public policy and the impact they will have on First Nations Australians. In that, the Albanese government will have this side of the chamber's full support.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  Recently, I had the pleasure of speaking at the Australian Local Government Women's Association annual breakfast, which was held at the Western Australian Local Government Association's convention in Perth. They are a wonderful group of enthusiastic leaders with a strong commitment and dedication to their community. I wish all candidates well in next weekend's local government elections in WA. The theme I was asked to speak on was 'A future focus', and I was asked to reflect on the history of challenges that women face in local government and provide a contrast to my current role as the member for Pearce in the Albanese Labor government. I decided that it was important to first take a look back in time so we can appreciate how far we have come as women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just half a century ago, societal expectations confined women to the roles of wives, mothers and primary caregivers for their children. Very few women worked outside the home during this era of 'respectability and conformity'. Men were considered the heads of the household and were responsible for financial and legal matters, and women received family allowances. However, throughout history, including as far back as 4,000 BC, there were pioneering women who studied, taught and practised medicine. Some were even known as wise women and some were known as witches. So let's just reflect on how our journey has unfolded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was 121 years ago, in 1902, that Australian women won the right to vote and stand for the Commonwealth parliament, but it was not until 1943 that Dame Enid Lyons became the first Australian woman elected to the House of Representatives. She was a trailblazer, along with Dame Dorothy Tangney—both serving as members of parliament. We need to celebrate these remarkable women, including those among us today. Currently the gender breakdown in Australian local government is nearly equal, with 50.9 per cent male and 49.1 per cent female representation. In the House of Representatives, as of January 2023, 58 of the 151 members are women, and 42 of the 76 senators are women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having served previously as mayor of the City of Wanneroo and on both the Western Australian and the Australian local government associations, I have had the privilege of collaborating with many talented men and women. The issues we face as women included concerns about whether we were respected and whether our opinions were valued, whether we were treated as equals and taken seriously, and whether we encountered harassment or sexual innuendo. It was disheartening to know that, in 2021, a report revealed that one in three people working for parliamentary offices had experienced sexual harassment. This report unveiled a deeply concerning culture of abuse within government offices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Soon I will be reading in parliament a speech written by Alexis Pallister, a visionary young woman in my electorate. Alexis has written that respect for women was the change she wanted to see for a better future for generations of young women. She raised the devastating loss of 43 women this year alone to gendered violence. She asked these questions: Why is this violence so normalised and where does it stem from? Could it be a lack of respect for women which in turn creates a culture whereby gendered violence is normalised, as women are seen as less? Alexis asked: If respect is one piece of this violent puzzle, are women being respected in parliament? And, if they are not being respected, what sort of precedent is that setting for our country?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, as the representative for Pearce in the House of Representatives within the Albanese Labor government, I can proudly say that I am treated as an equal within the ALP team and that our leader truly admires, respects and values the opinions of all of his colleagues, both male and female. I am pleased that the Albanese Labor government moved swiftly to introduce a code of conduct for parliamentarians, staffers and all employees in parliamentary workplaces, coupled with mandatory training for all to ensure a safe, respectful workplace. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Change will not occur overnight, but it is underway. Were there similarities I could draw on faced by women working in different tiers of government? Yes, there were, and we can do more. We can draw inspiration from the courage of women standing up, from our Matildas team inspiring a new generation of girls and boys to engage in sport and from the achievements of women in various fields across the nation who are excelling in their chosen professions. The future holds great promise. It's heartening to witness more women stepping into roles at local and other levels of government, bringing balance and a fresh perspective to their jobs. We can all advance through empowerment, standing tall and supporting one another with the belief and commitment that you can and will make a difference. It is this broad progress and these values that will inspire young women like Alexis and young men to become future leaders in our community, knowing that they will be supported in their chosen journeys. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LLEW O'BRIEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wide Bay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  Before the last federal election I warned that the greatest risk to the four-lane Tiaro bypass would be the election of an Albanese Labor government, and the deafening silence now coming from the government ever since it jeopardised the project by subjecting it to an independent 90-day review of infrastructure projects is only reinforcing my view. It's now been 169 days since the review was announced. The review has been completed, but the government is keeping us in the dark about which projects it will fund and those it will axe. Taxpayer funded infrastructure for the Brisbane Olympics was quarantined from the review, but the Albanese Labor government refused to give the lives of people travelling on our section of the Bruce Highway similar priority. Infrastructure for Brisbane Olympics will be in place long before we see four lanes between Curra and Maryborough. Now it's 79 days overdue, and, every day longer this review lingers out of the hands of the report's authors and in the minister's office, it loses its independence. The government must release the report now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this year alone five people have tragically died along the dangerous two-lane section of the National Highway between Gympie and Maryborough. It's a toll of devastating grief, sorrow and sadness for the victims and their families and friends in the communities affected by these horrific losses. We need to make the road as safe as possible and prevent crashes causing fatalities and serious injuries by eliminating the inherent hazards of a two-lane high-speed highway that is long past its expiry date. The Gympie bypass is expected to open later this year, extending the four-lane divided highway to Curra. But there are no commitments to extend the four lanes north from Curra to Maryborough, and this has to change. There are around 11,000 vehicle movements along this section of the National Highway per day, and, if this section was in any other jurisdiction, it would already have been four lanes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need the Tiaro bypass fast-tracked and prioritised, and we need four lanes from Curra to Maryborough, and the community wants it done. The early results from the Wide Bay community survey indicate that 80 per cent of respondents want a four-lane Tiaro bypass fast-tracked and 77 per cent want four lanes between Gympie and Maryborough. There are precedents for the fast-tracking of projects and upgrades of the Bruce Highway. When he was the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government in 2009, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese fast-tracked the four-lane Cooroy to Curra section of the Bruce Highway, section B of the project which goes around the non-existent Traveston Crossing dam. The former LNP Queensland government in 2013 fast-tracked Cooroy to Curra section A by committing 50 per cent of the funding, when the state's share would normally have been only been 20 per cent. In 2015 my predecessor in Wide Bay, Warren Truss as Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, together with the Queensland Minister for Transport and Main Roads, Mike Bailey, fast-tracked Corroy to Curra section C. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I implore the Albanese government to immediately release the review, and I call on them and the Queensland government to fast-track and prioritise the four-lane Tiaro Bypass and get on with making the whole section between Curra and Maryborough four lanes. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="299174" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAXALE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:44</span>):  In December last year, Azerbaijani forces blocked the highway connecting the Republic of Artsakh and Armenia. This deliberate action left 120,000 people trapped without secure access to essential supplies, including food, energy and medical resources. The tactics employed by Azerbaijani authorities in implementing and maintaining this blockade attempted to create unreasonable and untenable living circumstances for the people of Artsakh. The blockade was deliberate, and it created a humanitarian crisis that lasted for 281 days until, on 19 September 2023, in clear violation of the 2020 ceasefire between both countries, Azerbaijan launched a large-scale offensive against the Republic of Artsakh.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Azerbaijan's ministry of defence justified this offensive by claiming it was conducting antiterrorist activities. However, we know that the reality was very different. Azerbaijan claimed its operations were not targeting civilian positions. However, witnesses painted a different picture. Strikes were reported close to large cities and densely populated areas, raising significant concerns about the safety and wellbeing of the civilian population. By the end of that fateful day, Artsakh reported that 27 people had lost their lives and more than 200 were injured. The conflict led to further turmoil as authorities evacuated over 7,000 people from settlements. Fighting ended two days later and saw Azerbaijan open the border for the first time in months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fear of retribution at the hands of aggressors, tens of thousands of Armenians fled Artsakh. They were forced to flee their home for fear of death. As thousands fled Artsakh to escape the threat of genocide, a catastrophic explosion at a fuel storage facility resulted in the loss of at least 170 lives and injured more than 290 people. The victims were queueing to obtain fuel for their vehicles as they fled from their homes to Armenia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The events of September 2023 and the ongoing humanitarian crisis have deeply concerned human rights organisations and experts in genocide prevention. Alarming alerts have been issued, indicating that the ethnic Armenian population in Nagorno-Karabakh is at significant risk of genocide. Some argue that actions resembling genocidal acts are already taking place. The Lemkin Institute for Genocide Prevention has made an unequivocal statement, asserting:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There is no doubt in the minds of experts in genocide prevention … that what Armenians are facing from Azerbaijan is genocide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This assessment is not limited to a single organisation but is shared by institutions such as Genocide Watch, the International Association of Genocide Scholars and legal experts like former ICC chief prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is even more heartbreaking in light of the history of Armenia and the genocide it faced in the early 20th century. That genocide resulted in the mass murder and deportation of over 1.5 million Armenians. Men, women and children were subject to unimaginable atrocities, including forced labour, starvation and brutal acts of violence. It was a systematic and deliberate ethnic cleansing aimed at eradicating the Armenian population from its ancestral homeland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For many people, witnessing the unrest in Nagorno-Karabakh today has brought home horrendous memories, reopening deep wounds and reigniting a sense of collective trauma that has persisted for generations. This turmoil, coupled with the renewed violence, serves as a chilling reminder of the traumatic events of the past. There are around 50,000 Australian Armenians, most of whom are based in my electorate of Bennelong. Our Armenian community make Bennelong a better place to live. I'm proud to have a strong history of standing beside them in their fight for recognition and justice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, we are seeing a humanitarian crisis of growing proportions and it has been positive to see our allies and like-minded countries commit funds to help. The European Union, Germany, Italy, France, the United Kingdom and Canada have all given financial support to the International Committee of the Red Cross and similar humanitarian organisations to deliver urgent humanitarian assistance. I'm using my time in this place tonight to call on the Australian government to do the same. Please, we must support Armenian refugees with humanitarian aid at this tragic time.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="281826" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THOMPSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:49</span>):  Townsville is the capital of the Australian Army. Our city will be the new home for all of the Army's tanks, Boxer Combat Reconnaissance Vehicles, Redback infantry fighting vehicles and Huntsman self-propelled howitzers. These, along with the Apache and Chinook helicopter fleets, elevates Townsville to Australian's most critical army garrison town.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why I've welcomed the most recent announcement of the restructure that will see more than 500 uniformed Army personnel moved to Townsville by 2025 and our 3rd Brigade become an armoured combat brigade. That's 500 Army personnel. Families will be included as well, which will see us go well over 1,200 people moving to Townsville. This restructure will bolster our strength and defence capability as well as confirm Townsville as the Australian Army capital.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a great announcement and it has several benefits from a defence perspective. It is strategically a good move. Our 3rd Brigade as an armoured brigade is the lethality that we need in the north. The 3rd Brigade is known to deploy first, to deploy often and to go into those places that many don't want to. We saw recently the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, with attachments, go on the rescue mission into Afghanistan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Townsville's landscape is also a very similar environment to what we may expect to see when we fight overseas. You need to be able to train with what you'll fight with. So we need to have the equipment, we need to have the people and we need to have the will to be able to go and train to what we may be expected to see on the battlefield. There's no point having tanks down south or infantry fighting vehicles in the west when you've got the brigade that does the fighting in Townsville. Having everything together will allow us to be able to train with the equipment. You train with the equipment that you fight with. You can't replicate an infantry fighting vehicle or a tank. You need to have that equipment on the ground now, as well as the Chinooks that we've had for a long time, operating with the Apaches. In combat overseas on the battlefield, when the Chinooks are flying, the Apaches are providing support. When you're in a contact on the battlefield, Apaches are coming overhead to make sure that you're okay and you remain safe. So I think bringing these 500 Army personnel and their families to Townsville is a good move.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there are questions. Where will they live? Do we have the facilities for them? Will they be able to move straightaway? Where will they reside in Townsville? I think the families ask the same question. They're being told that they're relocating from Adelaide to Townsville, but they want to look for a home, somewhere they can raise their family, a place they can call theirs. We need Defence Housing Australia to change what they've been doing for some time. DHA goes and buys a house—an already built place—and wants to move families that move to Townsville into them. That doesn't work when you have a rental market so low. DHA need to now do what they used to do which is buy blocks of land and buy dwellings from the developers so that they can buy hundreds at a time to ensure that houses can be built to make sure that our people can get the housing that they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've written to the Assistant Minister for Defence, who covers DHA, and I've given him these suggestions. We need DHA to do what they've normally done, and that's to buy these blocks. But we also need to look at: Do we have the infrastructure, the support, around it? Do we have roads that can take the amount of traffic? Right now there are certain places in the North Shore where, if there was an accident, delay or congestion, it would be a 30- to 40-minute traffic delay. These things need to be addressed before you put an extra 500 people or more on the ground in the northern suburbs. These key areas that have been overlooked need to be addressed before people move here. We're asking the government to work with locals to ensure that houses are there and that roads and trunk infrastructure are built, because we want to welcome the soldiers and their families to Townsville.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:54</span>):  I'd like to thank the many hundreds of Fraser residents who gave up so much time to campaign for a 'yes' vote in the Voice referendum. While, as a nation and even as a state, we did not get the result that we wanted, I know that the team in Fraser gave it their absolute best. Of course, I respect the result of the referendum; at the same time, I want to acknowledge the incredibly hard work of those who gave their time, their passion and their commitment to the 'yes' campaign in Fraser and more broadly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Given that Fraser is one of the most diverse electorate is, the Fraser for Yes group left nothing to chance. Jenny and Tegan worked endless weekends and nights, building and organising a dedicated community of volunteers and leading a large number of events. They were well supported by Mai, who ensured the group had appropriate cultural messaging, particularly for our very large Vietnamese community, and who played a key role in getting the message out to our diverse communities. The Fraser for Yes group had over 500 registered volunteers, with 240 people registering to help on polling day alone. Volunteers spent months doorknocking, eventually speaking to more than 10,000 households. They ran 33 stalls and events at train stations, and ensured a presence all day, every day, for the two weeks of pre-polling and on the big day itself. I would particularly like to thank Julie-anne, Julie and all the other volunteers—too many to name individually—who went so far above and beyond the call of duty. They stood at train stations, market stalls and pre-polls; door knocked; and of course undertook the role of booth captains through good weather and bad. In the case of Melbourne, that's usually multiple times on the same day!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The strong sense of community was particularly apparent on the Sunday before polling day, when 400 people turned up for a final, massive doorknocking session in Cairnlea and surrounding suburbs. Around half the people at this event had never doorknocked before. This event was a remarkable reflection of how many people across the community were energised to participate in a political event for the first time. The volunteers set up a social media group to share ideas, arrange lifts and organise events that encompassed the whole electorate. On polling day it was wonderful to see so many teenagers handing out information, possibly their first experience of political action and, hopefully, not their last. Deep friendships were formed throughout the campaign, and the strong majority 'yes' vote in some of our most culturally diverse suburbs was inspiring. Thank you again to all the individuals involved in the Fraser for Yes campaign.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While on the subject of strong communities, I would also like to pay tribute to WEstjustice, a community legal centre that operates in Fraser and more broadly across Melbourne's west. Its team of lawyers, financial counsellors, advocates and social and community development workers is constantly advocating for the most vulnerable in our community. In addition, WEstjustice has a long history of innovative and rigorous policy work. WEstjustice works across four key areas in my community: culturally and linguistically diverse communities; people experiencing gender based violence; people experiencing economic injustice; and young people. When they see a concerning trend, they so often devise a program that can provide more systematic and targeted support while advocating to government to tackle the root cause.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Take their Mortgage Stress Victoria project as an example. This began as a pilot in 2016. Hundreds of people remain in their homes thanks to the wraparound support provided by the team which provides this program. The success of the program helped to secure ongoing government funding and means that people in mortgage stress throughout Victoria can now access support. Then there is the School Lawyer program, a pilot project launched in 2015 and which is now in four schools in the western suburbs and has expanded across the state and the country. Young people often have no idea of their rights or where to go for support when they experience wage theft, family violence or homelessness—or get caught up in minor criminal matters, for example. But the earlier people seek help then the easier it is to resolve legal issues. This is what community legal centres do best.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another unique offering from WEstjustice is the Migrant and Refugee Workers Legal Service. High levels of worker exploitation were identified, and lawyers supported more than 200 people to recover hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid entitlements and financial compensation for unlawful sackings. With a recent report showing that one in six migrants are paid less than the national minimum wage, the support provided by this program remains vital. Congratulations to the WEstjustice team for the hard work you do and your ongoing dedication.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Capricornia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  There are many unsung heroes who work behind the scenes to better the lives of fellow Australians. I rise today to pay tribute to one of those people, Dr Celeste Lawson from my electorate of Capricornia. Dr Lawson died suddenly on 2 September aged 52, but she left a legacy that involved helping to improve the lives of others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Lawson was an associate professor and lecturer at CQ University in Rockhampton. She held the high-profile position of president of CQU's academic board and was a member of the university council. In her early career, Dr Lawson was a journalist. She also served for 14 years with the Queensland Police Service, where she held the rank of acting senior sergeant. She had also worked for Western Australia's Crime and Corruption Commission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Lawson is survived by her husband, Christopher, an award-winning former ABC Radio broadcaster. Mr Lawson told mourners at her funeral that 'Celeste was a rainbow who coloured the lives of many people'. Mr Lawson said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Celeste's was a life of service. She served the news industry as a young reporter. When she filed a feature story about being out on the beat with the police one night she was inspired to apply to the Queensland police academy, rising to the rank of acting senior sergeant while in Rockhampton.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">She was one of the first cops in Queensland to be appointed as a school-based police officer to help teenagers in crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Here, she dedicated her days to advocating for teenagers with behavioural issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">She always maintained that there is no such thing as a "bad kid". It was merely the circumstances in which they were placed by adults, that influenced their need to act up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Lawson was known for her community service and carried the Olympic torch in the lead-up to the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, and the Queen's Baton for the 2006 Melbourne Commonwealth Games. An associate professor, she was also an advocate for the education of young people, mature-aged students and people from disadvantaged backgrounds. CQU vice-chancellor, Nick Klomp, described her as 'a light within the university who touched the lives of so many people in our community'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aside from her life in academia, Celeste was also known for her creative side. She was a prolific writer, a painter, a drawer and a needleworker. They were traits which she inherited from her Danish grandmother, Celeste Petersen. As a federal member, I will advocate for Dr Lawson to be recognised posthumously for an honour under the Order of Australia awards system. Vale, Dr Celeste Rae Lawson.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:33</span>):  The results of the referendum on Saturday left many in our community feeling disappointed and disheartened. Firstly, I would like to extend my gratitude and care to all First Nations people. We value your longstanding connection to our country and express our sadness that the modest request of the Uluru Statement from the Heart was not accepted by the Australian people. Although we are saddened, we accept the voice of and the decision made by the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Although I am disappointed, I also feel incredibly proud of my community in Macnamara. We have created a formidable movement of more than 1,000 volunteers, all dedicated to recognition and reconciliation. Macnamara delivered the sixth-highest 'yes' vote in all of Australia, and the third-highest in Victoria. Every single polling booth in our electorate on the day said yes to the Voice, with the majority of them doing so by extraordinary margins. A shout-out to St Kilda Primary School, who delivered and returned an 81 per cent 'yes' vote.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our campaign brought people together from all political persuasions. I was proud to campaign alongside members of the Liberal Party, the Greens and anyone else who was part of this movement. It was the first time many people had ever campaigned or engaged in a political campaign. We were guided by our local Indigenous people and leaders, like N'arweet Dr Carolyn Briggs, Aunty Jacko, Aunty Janet and, of course, the incredible people like Shelley Ware and Thomas Mayo who inspired us throughout the campaign. These bonds that were formed and promises made for a brighter future will not be forgotten. This is not the end, and there is more to come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I have a few people to thank. Thank you to Lachlan and Ella, our extremely dedicated captains for Macnamara for Yes. They are great people, and I'm very proud of them. Thank you to our hardworking area volunteer coordinators and vice-captains, Catherine, James, Jane S, Nick, Janet, Sean, Dave, Jane K, Jo and Keryn. And I'll give a special shout-out to Zarina, who walked with Michael Long from Melbourne to Canberra and campaigned every single day after that until the referendum—amazing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you to South Port Uniting Church for kindly donating a space for our campaign headquarters. Thank you to Port Phillip Citizens for Reconciliation for your commitment to justice and recognition, which began long before our campaign. Thank you to everyone who volunteered, doorknocked and picked up the phone. None of the results that we helped deliver in Macnamara would have been possible without you. Now we pick ourselves up for a better future together.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Banks</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:36</span>):  On 24 September, I attended the Greek Orthodox parish annual fete celebrations in Kogarah. It was a great celebration in particular this year because it coincided with the 12th Clergy-Laity Congress of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia. This event was attended by not only Australian clergy and laity but also senior members of the Greek Orthodox Church from around the world. It was wonderful to see His Eminence Archbishop Makarios on the day and also His Eminence Archbishop Nikitas of Great Britain, who joined us for the celebrations. It was a wonderful event with thousands of people in attendance. I want to thank the president of the Greek Orthodox church of Kogarah, Nickolas Varvaris, well known to this place as a former colleague here in the House of Representatives. The church at Kogarah is an absolute bedrock of our community, and it was tremendous to attend the annual fete celebrations.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 16 September I attended the annual awards dinner of the Bankstown basketball club, the Bruins. Bankstown basketball has a storied history that goes back to 1964. Literally thousands of people in our community participate in basketball down at the centre in Condell Park. The centre has been there for a long time and is a real centrepiece of the Condell Park community. On the night, at Bankstown Sports Club, we acknowledged many different players who had done great things during the season. That included many of the volunteers and coaches and a number of players from Bankstown who have represented junior national teams from around the Pacific but also are part of the Bankstown basketball community. It was a tremendous night. To Christian Gobolos, the CEO, and everyone who does so much at Bankstown basketball, thank you for what you do for our community.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Florence Jiang is a very talented and hardworking swimmer. She is part of the St George Swim Club and represents that club with great distinction. Recently, at the Sydney Olympic Park School Sport Australia swimming competition, Florence was very successful in her efforts. She received a bronze medal in the 16-year-old girls 100-metre freestyle and also a silver medal in the girls four-by-100-metre freestyle relay. This is a tremendous achievement, because schools from all corners of Australia came to this event at Sydney Olympic Park. Florence is a tremendous credit to the St George Swim Club and to our community. A big congratulations to Florence Jiang.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PRICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Durack</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:42</span>):  I will continue to raise the catastrophic actions of this government which are threatening so many of our proud Western Australian farmers. Of course, I'm referring to the ideological crusade against the live sheep export industry by those opposite. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party's determination to ban live sheep exports has nothing to do with animal welfare and everything to do with inner-city perception and the Labor Party's efforts to keep seats away from the Greens party. The reality is that Australia's live sheep export trade leads the world in both quality and animal welfare standards. It is often said that a sheep is more likely to die on any given day on a farm rather than on a ship. The mortality rate in transit is just 0.15 per cent. But this government does not acknowledge that fact, nor the reality that overseas markets will immediately turn to others where animal welfare is not a priority. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I want to express the heartache that I've been hearing from thousands of farmers across Western Australia who are united in their opposition to this proposed ban. To cite just one example, Jake, a York farmer, has explained to me that he is worried about the future of his farm and indeed the future of our regional towns in Western Australia. Jake told me that, while for some farmers live export may not even represent a majority of their income, live export can be the difference between surviving and going under. Two years ago, he was able to sell his merino wethers at $140 per head. Today that price is down to just $50 per head. That's staggering enough without even acknowledging the current cost-of-living crisis. With income down, the input costs, from fuel to electricity to equipment, are all trending upwards under this government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I ask the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry: how is this sustainable? How long does this government expect our farmers to stay afloat if their cries for reprieve are ignored? And if the farmers can't afford to keep going, what then for our regional towns? You see, it's the whole sheep industry that is now impacted, not just the live export trade. Labor have been crystal clear that they don't care about the hardship that WA farmers are experiencing. We saw this through their so-called consultation process whereby they sent out representatives to the regions but the fundamental question of whether a phase-out was actually viable was not up for discussion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that it's not just WA farmers who are now suffering. With the domestic market price collapsing in part due to overseas markets losing confidence and the consequential growth in domestic stock, sheep producers over in eastern states are hurting too. Western Australians understand only too well that this government does not listen to us. However, I hope with the impact on other states now that these consequences are reaching close to the Prime Minister, because this will now be starting to impact people on the east coast. If you won't take Western Australia seriously, please take the rest of the country seriously. I'll continue to fight for WA farmers. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:45</span>):  Today, I'd like to take the opportunity to acknowledge the Tamil community in my electorate. Parramatta is home to one of the largest Tamil communities in the country, with more than 7,500 Tamil speakers and over 5,000 people who identified as having Tamil ancestry in the 2021 census. The postcodes of 2145 and 2146, both of which are in Parramatta, rank the highest in Tamil ancestry out of any postcode in Australia. It's a community I'm proud to represent, and I'd like to thank the local Tamil community for their friendship and their contribution to the wider Parramatta area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Tamils are a wonderful people. Like so many other multicultural communities, they enrich Parramatta's identity as one of the most multicultural electorates in the country. They do this by championing a joyous culture. It was my pleasure, for example, to attend the Pongal harvest festival at Parramatta Park earlier this year. This four-day celebration brings families and friends together from right across the community and is an ancient tradition involving spiritual gratitude, celebration and renewal. It was a privilege to attend, and I can't wait for the next Pongal festival in 2024.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to pay tribute to the community leaders, who contribute so much to our area: Shanji Gunaratnam and those from Kamban Kazhagam Australia; the Tamil Valarchi Manram; the New South Wales Federation of Tamil Schools; Anagan Babu Ramia Janardhanan and the team at the Tamil Arts and Culture Association; Rishi Rishikesan from the Consortium of Tamil Associations NSW; the team at the Australia Tamil Arts and Culture Development Centre; and so many more whose contributions strengthen our community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More recently, I've had the pleasure of visiting the Sydney Murugan Temple at Mays Hill. If you one day find yourself driving along the Great Western Highway in Mays Hill, keep an eye out for this sacred building. It stands tall for all to see and admire. Not only is the temple an architectural triumph; it's a place to worship, sing and be with family and community.</span>

They voted against the referendum proposal. In South Australia, 64.6 per cent voted no. In my electorate of Grey, 78.4 per cent voted no. There have been 44 referendums in Australia's history prior to this one. Eight have been successful. None have passed without bipartisan support. One would ask the question why the Prime Minister decided to plough ahead regardless on a referendum which has undoubtedly divided Australia. I note more division in the community at the moment than I've seen in perhaps two or three decades. It will take some time to bring us all back together.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I don't think there's much doubt the Prime Minister sought not to reach a bipartisan position.

                  </a>  If the member from Queensland interrupting there thinks that there was a reach-out, he is deluding himself. It was deliberately designed to put the coalition on the other side of the argument and, thus, the Prime Minister thought he would bury the coalition on the wrong side of history. Well, he backed the wrong horse. The reason it was the wrong horse is he was never able to adequately explain to the Australian public, firstly, how this new body would achieve change and, secondly, what the ramifications of that change would be. There were plenty of conflicting legal opinions all over Australia telling us all kinds of different outcomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This has been a poor exercise. It has cost a lot of money and it has brought Australia to a poorer position than where we started. From here, we have to work to bridge that gap. There's a very interesting article in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Weekend Australian</span> which shows where the disadvantage sits within Indigenous communities. In Australia, 37 per cent of Indigenous people sit within the bottom quintile. In the next two quintiles are 60 per cent of Australians, living in suburbia and the larger centres and actually enjoying a lifestyle very similar to the rest of Australia. So there is no good argument that they need another Voice in parliament. It is that bottom quintile—many of which live in my electorate and many of whom voted against this proposal—that we need to concentrate our efforts on to bring about change for them.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:50</span>):  A little over five months ago, I stood in this place celebrating with the people of Bendigo and, in particular, our many hard workers at Bendigo Thales, because our government had awarded them a new contract of $160 million to build more Bushmasters at their facility. It was a contract that we believed in good faith would save the site and the many jobs that we have there—a lot of blue-collar, highly skilled working jobs that we have. To our disappointment, four months later—about a month ago—Thales announced that they were calling for voluntary redundancies at the site and were planning to make a further 49 people redundant. I am deeply disappointed in Thales Australia for this decision.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know from talking to the men and women at the workplace that while they knew there would be a few jobs lost after the wind-up of the Hawkei build, they did not expect it to be 49. It's a significant chunk of their blue-collar workforce—highly skilled, highly professional workers—that we need. We need that skill and that capability here in Bendigo. I'm calling on Bendigo Thales and, in fact, Thales Australia, to do better by those workers. The expressions of interest have closed for the voluntary redundancies and my understanding from talking to the workers onsite is they've received only about half the expressions of interest they were seeking, well short of 49. We don't want to see any forced redundancies on this site.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thales Australia is a large multinational company. They have many contracts. They've got a lot of work. They can afford to find alternative work for these workers in Bendigo. People can work at their other sites. Thales can look at upskilling the workers that they believe have no future at this site. I call on them to do better, to show respect and support for the people who've given so much to this company.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a proud manufacturing history in Bendigo. We built the Bushmasters and the sons of Bushmasters—Hawkeis—and we can see the difference these vehicles can make. We also have a proud defence manufacturing history across Australia and we want to see these skills retained. As a new government, we are pivoting and changing our defence manufacturing, reprioritising what we focus on. What the minister is committed to is having that skill and capability onshore in this country. I call on Bendigo Thales and Thales Australia to do the right thing by their Bendigo workers—no forced redundancies—and make sure that every worker who wants to stay at the site will be given a decent opportunity. Bendigo calls upon you to do this. We want to continue to have that strong and proud defence manufacturing capability in our town. And I call on Thales Australia to do the right thing by their workers in Bendigo.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHANEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:53</span>):  In the last year, more than 400 Curtin constituents have contacted me about their concerns regarding the expansion of Woodside's North West Shelf gas processing plant at the Burrup Hub in the north-west of WA, and the related development of the Browse Basin. Woodside is planning to extend this project through to 2070. This has far-reaching consequences. My constituents have three different types of concerns in relation to this. Firstly, this project has significant environmental impact. The Browse Basin project involves drilling 54 wells in Scott Reef, a sanctuary for nesting sea turtles, pygmy and blue whales, dugong, and many other protected species of marine life. These species are directly impacted by drilling, dredging, pollution and any oil spills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, if it continues to 2070, the emissions from the production and use of the gas from this processing facility are about the same as Australia's entire emissions budget from 2030 onwards. This single project will have a global impact on our ability to decarbonise in time. But, believe it or not, the climate impacts of projects like this don't have to be considered in the approvals process. Climate change is the biggest threat to national security, the biggest threat to future prosperity and the biggest threat to a liveable planet, but our laws say it's not relevant to environmental approval processes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, the Burrup Hub is right next to Murujuga, which contains more than a million rock art petroglyphs dating back 50,000 years, including depictions of extinct animals and some of the earliest known images of the human face. There's deep concern that the acidic industrial emissions from facilities around the Burrup Peninsula are damaging the area's rock art, and expanding Burrup will make it worse. Under our environmental regulations, the EPA WA appeals convenor is currently considering the approval of this project. This is the same EPA that was called by the WA Premier and told to lay off imposing requirements on the gas industry. A recommendation will be made to the state minister, who will make a decision about project approval. I don't hold out huge hope that our long-term interests will trump the gas industry's interests in this decision. After this the federal minister would also need to approve the project. I've met with the minister, reiterated the importance of this project and implored her to exercise her power to undertake her own separate assessment of the proposal and not rely on the WA government's assessment. I appreciate that she said she would be considering the matter on its merits when it comes before her. I thank all constituents who have contacted me about this project and reiterate that I will continue to encourage the government to consider its impact on the unique wildlife in the region, our cultural history and the planet.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:56</span>):  I rise to thank the people of Newcastle for voting yes in the referendum last weekend. Newcastle has recorded the highest 'yes' vote outside of any capital city in Australia, and that is something we should all be very proud of. Thank you for answering the call of First Nations people, for recognition, for listening and for better outcomes for all Australians. I'm enormously grateful to the hundreds of volunteers in Newcastle who knocked on doors, made phone calls and ran street stalls and community events. Novocastrians showed up in their thousands to walk for yes. They had conversations with their families, their friends, their neighbours and their workmates. Almost 6,000 doors were knocked on since mid-July. More than 400 yard signs were proudly displayed on fences and houses. Hundreds of phone calls were made over many weeks. There were 12 street stalls in suburbs across Newcastle. The 'yes' vote result in Newcastle is testament to this massive effort.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge those locally based organisations that came out publicly to support the 'yes' campaign, including the City of Newcastle and the University of Newcastle, which listened to the voices of students, staff and alumni to reach its considered position. The University of Newcastle has the highest number of First Nations students of any university in Australia, and its decision was led by evidence and following consultation over a number of months, including surveys, information sessions and community reference groups.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I especially want to pay tribute to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders who gave so much of themselves to bring fellow Australians on this journey. It has been a long road across some very difficult terrain, and the people of Newcastle stand with you. I know that many Novocastrians will be feeling disheartened by the national results, but this is not the start or the end of the struggle for First Nations justice. It has been with us for a very long time. We will take some time to pause and reflect as a community but then regather because our commitment and conviction for a better future for Australia's First People is no less urgent today than it was yesterday or even decades ago. Together we will forge a new path. I know we can do this.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion deals with one of the most critical issues facing Australia today and into the future, our energy supply: our energy supply at present and our energy supply into the future. Before I was elected I thought of myself, and still do, as a recovering environmental lawyer. In that sense I want to mention the precautionary principle. The precautionary principle is a fundamental of environmental law. It states</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">If a product, an action or a policy has a suspected risk of causing harm to the public or to the environment, protective action should be supported before there is complete scientific proof of a risk.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've always supported our country moving to net zero emissions. The coalition supports that policy. However, this motion is brought particularly on the basis of the recent statement from the Australian Energy Market Operator's report that led to dire warnings about an increased chance of blackouts this summer that this country, particularly in my home state of New South Wales, has not seen since the 1970s.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This demonstrates that the Labor government's energy policy, led by Minister Bowen, is going down the wrong path. Again, I would urge the minister and the government to exercise the precautionary principle. It now has the warnings from the AEMO about the potential damage of getting off the boat before we're at the wharf. Minister Bowen has repeatedly claimed that he is leading an economic transformation bigger than the industrial revolution. That may well be the case. When leading a transformation such as this, however, it has to be done in a measured way. And, as I said, there is an old saying relevant to this debate, relevant to the rollout of such a transformation: do not get off the boat until we're at the wharf. The boat I'm talking about is the boat that has for centuries delivered us affordable and reliable energy. The government's policies on this at present, though, are driving the premature closure of baseload power generation and failing to replace the capacity as it promised it would.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In that vein, then, the government's zealotry towards renewables and in looking only at renewables for our future energy supply is setting the whole renewables energy industry up for failure. A renewables-only grid has not worked in any country in the world. Minister Bowen is yet to demonstrate how it is going to work here. In fact, he now has evidence from the AEMO that at present—its current rollout—it is not going to be successful here either. We are in the process whereby around 80 per cent of our existing baseload energy will shut down by 2035 under this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are paying some of the highest energy bills in the world. Australian families say this. Australian businesses say this. Wherever you go in the country, when we all move through our electorates, everybody is concerned about the cost of their energy. But policies such as the government's rollout and its refusal to look at anything other than renewables has caused this energy crisis. Most Australians are now paying $1,000 a year more for their energy than they were paying in May 2022; many in my electorate would be happy if they were paying only $1,000 a year more. Therefore, I call on this government to look at a hybrid model of technologies for our future. We cannot get off gas, which has served this country very well, until we have demonstrated sufficient baseload power to power our industries and to power our homes into the future. The government needs to stop now, look at the precautionary principle and roll out its transformation in a far more measured way.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:05</span>):  Australia is dealing with the consequences of a decade of chaos, denial and delay on energy security and action on climate change by the previous government, a decade which saw a staggering four gigawatts of dispatchable capacity exit the energy system with a mere one gigawatt entering to replace those losses. It's a failure that left the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry to deliver a scathing assessment of the former government by stating, 'The Liberals past failure to deal with this reality left our energy sector in disarray.' It's a decade of inaction that the ACCI said meant that Australian businesses and households were now paying the price of the inaction of those opposite. From failing to act on energy security to hiding price rises from the public, these actions—or lack of action—of the former government paint a clear picture of a government that was not serious about addressing energy security or delivering cheaper energy for Australians. Their legacy is one of denial and neglect, resulting in a loss of capacity and surging energy costs, and seeking, yet again, to blame the new government for the consequences of their actions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this isn't really about energy security to them. This is just another way for them to deny and delay the move to renewable energy and for our government to continue to take genuine climate action. A reminder to everyone, particularly to those opposite: renewable energy is the cheapest form of energy available today. And we know this because the CSIRO and the Australian Energy Market Operator say so. In April 2023, AEMO said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Renewable energy is driving down the wholesale cost of energy, setting new records for minimum demand for electricity from the grid and driving emissions to record lows …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's lower costs and record low emissions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite this reality, we have an opposition that's entrenched in an anti-renewable fantasy. They constantly seek to delay the roll out of renewable energy, grasping at any argument and any solution they can find. Their opposition to renewable energy isn't only just ideological but an extension of their decade's long opposition to taking meaningful climate action. The urgency of addressing climate change requires immediate and sustained action, not further delays, not further distraction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In June this year we saw the former Deputy Prime Minister rallying anti-renewables groups on the steps of Parliament House. In last year's budget reply, we saw the Leader of the Opposition calling for nuclear power in Australia, despite the fact that experts over and over have continually made it clear that nuclear is incapable of delivering the solutions that we need today. Those opposite would prefer that we invest in technology that doesn't exist over technology that does exist. They live in a fantasy, rather than in reality. The Leader of the Opposition continues to vote against legislation aimed at reducing emissions and reducing power prices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Sunrise Project's 2022 <span style="font-style:italic;">Climate compass</span> report reveals that four in five Australians are deeply concerned about climate change. Notably, the concern for climate change and the continued use of coal, oil and gas has been steadily increasing. According to the same report a remarkable 71 per cent of Australians agree that climate change is an issue that demands immediate action and 70 per cent acknowledge that Australia is already experiencing the effects of climate change. Perhaps the most compelling statistic is that 76 per cent of Australians agree that in the future our country should rely on renewable energy more than it currently does.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear Australians are not just concerned about climate change but are actively supporting the transition to renewable energy, and that's why Australians voted for a government that will take climate action, with renewable energy infrastructure at the centre of that action. And we're delivering it. Minister Plibersek is approving more than double the amount of renewable energy projects than her predecessor. Only an hour ago there was announcement for another solar farm, this one's in Marulan, that will power 56,000 homes without disrupting farming activities. Projects like these will help us get to 82 per cent renewable energy by 2030.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Bowen is making up for a decade of inaction from the Liberals. He's delivering $20 billion for infrastructure needed to transmit this renewable energy to areas that need it. Those opposite didn't fund the connection of Snowy Hydro to the grid. We're fixing that. We're delivering $1.3 billion in funds to help homes electrify, helping them take advantage of free or cheap renewable energy to power their homes. We're getting on with the job with a plan for cheaper energy and renewable energy.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PRICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Durack</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:10</span>):  I'm very pleased to rise today to second the motion from the member for Hughes because I'm deeply concerned about the stability of our electricity system under this government. On this side of the House we recognise you cannot have a strong and successful economy without a reliable energy system. Given the importance of the grid, the Australian Energy Markets Operator's dire warnings of blackouts this summer and beyond should concern everyone in this place. This warning should be enough to get those opposite to reflect on their ideological positions. The Labor Party took to the last election a nonsensical promise to convert our electricity market from a place of around 30 to 35 renewable energy to 82 per cent by 2030, which is only seven years away. I call it a nonsense promise because there was no road map then, nor indeed is there today, as to how we will get there. The Albanese government are determined to remove base load power such as coal and gas from the system and replace it with solar, wind and other renewable sources. The Minister for Climate Change and Energy repeatedly claims he's leading an economic transformation bigger than the industrial revolution, yet Labor have refused to have Treasury complete any modelling on its energy plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are already paying some of the most expensive energy bills in the world under this government. This is despite their pre-election promise to lower electricity bills by $275. Yet it is clear Australians are paying more for the privilege of increased risks of blackouts. I understand that Labor choose to ignore questions surrounding detail, but surely the prospects of blackouts are enough to get this government to acknowledge it is putting us on an incredibly reckless path. How can this government possibly proceed with closing our base load power stations, and what is the solution—to install 22,000 solar panels a day and 40 giant wind turbines a month, attaching them to transmission lines that don't yet exist? They also pay lip service to renewable energy projects up and down the coast of Western Australia, many of them proposed to be in my electorate of Durack. However, what they don't tell you is that this energy is probably not going to be returned to the grid, lowering prices and making sure we have a reliable energy source, but rather used to create ammonia for export. I ask: is this a hydrogen revolution, or is it simply a hoax? We're told this rushed transition to renewables is needed to avert the worst climate scenarios, including significant increases to climate related deaths. Let me tell you: in Durack what saves lives are very good air conditioners. Air conditioners save older Australians, especially in my part of the world, where they have incredibly hot summers, but they're no good in a blackout. As we head towards summer, let's hope WA Premier Cook doesn't need to get coal from Newcastle, like he had to do last summer, to make sure we kept the lights on and we kept the air conditioners on in what was another hot summer in Durack.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another nonsensical element of this transition is we are consistently told weather patterns will become harder to predict, yet this government plans to make our grid significantly more reliant on the weather. On this side of the House we understand renewables are of course an important part of the mix. In fact during our time in government we were able to boost the share of renewables in the system whilst keeping energy prices low. We led the world in rooftop solar, with in one in four households taking it up. But by going all in on renewables you are setting the grid up for failure. A successfully functioning electricity grid does not exist without base load power. The climate wars are over, but the energy wars have begun. The only way Australians are going to secure victory in this battle is if Labor move past their radical positions on energy. What is needed is an-all-of-the-above approach to this energy transition, not ministers like Chris Bowen picking and choosing which technology they like best and banning all the rest. We need all technologies—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:15</span>):  The opposition has engaged in hyperbole with this motion, when for 10 long years the coalition government did little to address the need for energy transition. Now in opposition they have the temerity to claim that any problems faced by the grid are entirely of the making of the Labor government. They were the ones that over three years ago promised $1 billion to support 3,800 megawatts of new generation but delivered not one dollar and not one kilowatt. They are the ones who have the track record of four gigawatts of capacity leaving the system but only one gigawatt put back in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Energy Market Operator is responsible for the security of the national energy market, and they have undertaken extensive modelling in relation to the future energy needs of Australia. Yes, the experts and even the nightly weather reports are predicting this will be a hot and dry summer, but the government is working collaboratively with states and territories to prepare. AEMO's <span style="font-style:italic;">2023 Electricity statement of opportunities</span> report states in relation to this summer that approximately 3.4 gigawatts more of new generation and storage capacity from a range of technologies is expected to be available compared to what was available last summer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The market is speaking. Green energy is cheaper. Only the opposition would consider that the government is following an ill-informed pathway by decarbonising the grid. We are acting to fix the mess left behind by those opposite, delivering overdue policy certainty and investing in the cheapest form of energy—renewables. We're making up for a decade of inaction with a $20 billion Rewiring the Nation fund. We are implementing the Capacity Investment Scheme to increase new dispatchable capacity and to ensure reliability. We delivered more than $1.7 billion for the Energy Savings Package in the last budget, for energy savings upgrades for homes, business and social housing, to cut bills and reduce pressure on the grid.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the electorate of Cunningham, steps are being taken to assist Australia to build a strong and clean energy future. A proposed offshore wind zone is currently out for consultation, and I had many conversations in the recess with my community about our future energy needs. I have had many of those conversations with young people in my community, who are particularly concerned about our environment. They are a generation that have seen nothing but the effects of climate change: volatile temperature differences, fires, floods, erosion and habitat loss. This worries them. They know that we need to look at new ways to generate strong, reliable and renewable energy. Businesses in my community have sent me the very clear message that in the future they need strong, reliable and renewable energy. Major manufacturers know that they are going to need renewables to produce their products, not just because of the cost but also because the market is going to demand clean and renewable products. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">BlueScope Steel recently said they'll need 15 times the current amount of electricity to transform the Port Kembla Steelworks and make the same volume of steel using hydrogen powered direct reduced iron-making, or DRI, technology. BlueScope Steel currently uses 750,000 megawatt hours of grid supplied electricity across the steelworks per year. This equates to the usage of about 150,000 households, and they're going to need 15 times that to make green steel. The offshore wind proposal for the Illawarra, if implemented at the current size, would generate enough electricity to power 3.4 million houses. BlueScope Steel will need about two-thirds of that amount of energy to keep our local steelworks open and producing green steel in the future. BlueScope currently employs 3,500 people directly in the Illawarra and is responsible for a total of 9,000 jobs in the region, including contractors and suppliers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also locally, Australian Industrial Power, a subsidiary of Squadron Energy, is developing a 635 megawatt Port Kembla energy hub. While this project is in the early stages of development, it is indicative of the steps being taken by private investors as we move to new energy sources. It is renewable forms of power, not just any old power, which are going to sustain and grow thousands of jobs in my local community. Future energy generation will not be a task for a few communities in Australia; it will be a responsibility for every community and every household.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:20</span>):  The Albanese Labor government told the people of Australia that they had an energy plan to solve net zero. Their energy minister all too gleefully repeats this ad nauseam in the House, mocking anyone who dares to suggest differently. He believes he's leading an energy and economic transformation bigger than the industrial revolution. The minister and his colleagues are all aboard the reckless rush-to-renewables train, with no thought as to how the lights will be kept on in every house across Australia. As part of his push, at least 80 per cent of Australia's base-load energy will be shut down by 2035. Labor are looking for a renewables-only grid, and they are trying to convince the public that any other form of energy generation is some sort of evil. They are far from technology neutral. It is Labor who are the wreckers. They are wrecking our country's access to a reliable and affordable supply of energy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Energy Market Operator has ranked my state of Victoria as the worst state in the country for energy security. The state energy minister, Lily D'Ambrosio, cannot guarantee there won't be blackouts this summer as Victoria leads the charge to renewables. The damning AEMO report said that soaring summer temperatures due to an expected El Nino would seriously test supplies. While the biggest risk of blackouts is in January 2024, they could possibly occur from November. Supply shortfalls are also expected to drive wholesale electricity prices up, and it is families who will foot the bill. These shortfalls are being driven by a renewables agenda, with the federal government's ideology being carried forward by its Victorian Labor counterparts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Late in 2022, the Albanese Labor government introduced a price cap on the gas market. They were warned at the time that this would risk investments and throw the market into chaos, but they ploughed ahead. What was the result? Ian Mortlock, a tomato grower in my electorate, reported to me that he couldn't get his gas company to give him any more than a month-to-month contract. Uncertainty in the market creates uncertainty for consumers. Mr Mortlock was unsure about what he would do to continue his harvesting of crops. A confident market keeps the lights on and the power prices down, but Labor, at the helm of energy policy, hasn't been able to provide that. It is cold comfort that they didn't fully ban gas altogether, unlike their Victorian counterparts, under pressure from the Greens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We in the coalition have adopted an all-of-the-above approach because there are solutions to Australia's Labor induced energy woes if the government ceases its stubborn track and crusade. Coal-fired power stations have kept our power running for decades, but Labor will see them ripped out as soon as possible with no regard for how that will affect Australia's energy grid. Nuclear is being adopted elsewhere in the world and is proven to be clean, efficient and safe, but the energy minister speaks as if nuclear is some kind of bogeyman. He says that the coalition's proposal to use nuclear would cost $387 billion. However, his claims have since been rubbished. Former assistant secretary for nuclear energy at the United States Department of Energy Rita Baranwal criticised the minister's maths. She is now a senior vice-president of Westinghouse in the United States, whose own small modular nuclear reactor cost around $1.58 billion and will be used to supplement renewable energy as a base-load generator.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bearing in mind that nuclear would be able to be plugged into existing grids—good story!—taking away the need for expensive new infrastructure and the destruction of social licence that comes with building transmission lines, particularly in my patch, nuclear can be part of a policy that will secure Australia's energy grid, cut emissions and also lower power bills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our great island continent is blessed with abundant energy sources of every kind: coal, gas, uranium, wind, solar and more. Simple economics tells you that the sensible approach is not to put all your eggs in one basket. It's time for the Albanese Labor government and its energy minister to come clean. Their energy policies are hurting the country. They are hurting the grid that keeps our lights on and our appliances working. Most of all, they are hurting everyday Australians' hip pockets.</span>

If only the Liberals and Nationals had been in government for the past 10 years—Australia would be awash in energy! We would have nuclear power, nuclear reactors in every suburb and town in Australia. But where were they for the past 10 years? Oh: they were in government!

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a bold move on the part of the member for Hughes, given the energy policy chaos inflicted upon the nation under the stewardship of her party when in government, to bring on this motion. The member came to this place in 2022, at the same time that her party was removed from government, so she may be unaware of the shocking truth of just how badly her side ran energy policy. For example, it was under the Liberal government that four gigawatts of dispatchable capacity left the grid and only one gigawatt entered it. That's a net loss of three gigawatts of energy in the grid over the term of the former Liberal government.</span>

It was the former Liberal government that led toxic crusades against renewable energy, with the former Liberal Treasurer even moaning about the view being spoiled by the turbines on the drive to Canberra—the poor thing! But it didn't stop there. The former government vetoed a $280 million loan for a 157-megawatt windfarm in northern Queensland because it was 'inconsistent with the objectives and policies of the Commonwealth government'—and too right it was; it was absolutely inconsistent with the qualities of that government. It says it all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Hughes wants to talk about increasing power costs, so let's talk about them. Let's talk about how the Liberals kept rising energy costs secret when they were in government. When he was asked directly whether he knew about imminent wholesale energy price rises, the then energy minister and now shadow Treasurer, the member for Hume, said, 'No, I didn't.' But the member for Hume amended the industry code for electricity retailers three days before the May 2022 election was called, to delay the release of increases in the default market offer for New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia until after the election. The Liberals knew energy prices were rising, they watched it happen and they hid it from Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In May 2019 the Liberals promised to deliver average wholesale prices of $70 a megawatt hour by the end of 2021. Instead, the average wholesale price at the time of the election, in May 2022, was $286.18. The Liberals promised that energy prices would decrease by 25 per cent. Instead, they rose by 240 per cent. More than three years ago the Liberals promised a billion dollars to support 38,000 megawatts of new generation. Not one dollar, not one kilowatt, was delivered. You could not even turn on a light bulb with what the Liberals contributed to the energy grid.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is fixing the mess the Liberals left behind. We are delivering policy certainty and investment credibility. We took a plan to the election, and we are delivering that plan. If the Liberals ever bothered to take an interest in Tasmania we could have told them long ago that the future was renewable. In the state proudly producing the most hydroelectric power in the country, proudly publicly owned, renewable energy powers industry, homes and small business across Tasmania. It delivers jobs and financial security for thousands of Tasmanian families and provides a blueprint for national renewable energy success. The Albanese government is making up for a decade of inaction with a $20 billion Rewiring the Nation fund to deliver long-overdue and desperately needed upgrades to our grid, with major projects in Tasmania already announced. Ten thousand kilometres of additional transmission lines will link cheap and clean renewable energy, including in Tasmania, via the Marinus Link to the existing grid. Five out of every six jobs that Rewiring the Nation provides will be delivered across regional Australia. That's good news for people living in the regions. But, instead, we have those opposite complaining about the impact of transmission lines on cattle and sheep.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government also delivered more than $1.7 billion for the energy savings package in the last budget and of course the energy bill relief that those opposite voted against. You can't come in here complaining about power price rises when you're voting against— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:30</span>):  This motion is about blackouts, this motion is about energy and this motion is about what we can do to secure our future. We've just heard the member for Lyons talking about the Liberal government. He forgets also that the Nationals were in government with the Liberals. It's not always and all about the Liberal Party. Whilst I appreciate he's against the Liberals in Tasmania, the National Party was very much in a coalition government and is still in coalition with the Liberal Party. We will do everything that we can, united together, to hold this Labor-Greens-Teals government to account for high energy prices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to energy prices, the now Prime Minister, the member for the inner-city Sydney seat of Grayndler, promised on no fewer than 94 occasions prior to the May election last year that power bills would be reduced by $275. I can well recall that social media tile popping up everywhere. No doubt it was boosted and sponsored by the Labor dirt unit to get out there to convince voters to put the number 1 beside the ALP candidate in their electorate. But there was no asterisk and then little riders or disclaimers saying that it was $275 by the year 2025. There was no disclaimer to say anything of the sort. It said that the Labor Party, in government, would reduce power prices by $275. It was a porky. It was a fib. Call it a lie, as so many have, because it wasn't true. It hasn't rung true.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, energy prices under the former coalition government came down by eight per cent in the last 12 months of its government. My energy prices at home came down, as did other people's home power bills, as did, just as importantly, the bills of business and small business. They are doing it so tough at the moment. They are the ones who go out every day and take risks. They employ people. They make things. They provide services. They have not been looked after by this Labor government, which came to office promising so much and which has delivered so little, so very precious little, in the time it's been in office since May last year. They've talked about a lot of things—things which haven't made a tangible, practical difference to the lives of ordinary, everyday Australians or to the benefit of small business, which runs this country. Those opposite have been happy to say that they are going to have home-grown, made-in-Australia, modern manufacturing, but, at the same time, they're shutting down the very source of power that those businesses, manufacturers and industry sector rely so heavily upon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But don't take my word for it. I would encourage those opposite to talk to one of our meat-processing plants. I appreciate, at the moment, that they're making a small killing, pardon the pun, on the fact that animals—cattle, sheep—are realising such low prices at the markets. Indeed, a West Australian farmer offered 600 breeding ewes for free if someone just came and took them away. That's because of the live animal export ban. If the farmers aren't getting anything at the market and the prices haven't come down at the supermarket, the meat-processing plants are making, as I said, a killing. But they are also paying high energy costs—they, manufacturers, everybody right across this nation. What we're going to see come this summer is stress upon our energy grid. What we will see is blackouts. As sure as God made little green apples, we are going to see blackouts, and it's on Labor's watch. What are they doing about it? They are doing diddly squat, nothing at all. <span style="font-style:italic;">(</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Time expired</span><span style="font-style:italic;">)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently headed to the Mornington Peninsula to host a round table on regional arts with the member for Flinders and once again saw the importance of the arts in areas outside of cities and the commitment of people working in that sector, often as volunteers, to provide opportunities for participation in the arts. We were generously hosted by Julie Collins at &amp; Gallery in Sorrento, and I thank everyone who joined us. I walked away with many ideas, including being reminded why we have commercial galleries talked about in our national cultural policy, Revive. They are a key component that supports the arts, especially in regional areas. To tell the Australian story, regional voices must be heard. The Albanese government believes creativity has a place in every community and that every Australian has a right to creative expression and to participate in the arts, no matter their postcode. The arts brings people together and improves community wellbeing. It invigorates regional economies, supports local jobs, encourages cultural tourism and improves the quality of life in regional areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the organisations that have long known and championed this is Regional Arts Australia. I had the privilege of speaking at their 80th anniversary celebration recently. Regional Arts Australia contracts regional arts organisations in each state and territory to deliver our Regional Arts Fund, awarding grants to artists, arts workers and organisations. We heard from Marta Dusseldorp, now settled in regional Tasmania, who spoke powerfully about the need to support regional communities to tell their stories and what we all stand to gain when we hear those stories. Of course, <span style="font-style:italic;">Bay of Fires</span> on ABC iView is a great example of those stories. I'm looking forward to engaging in regional arts this coming weekend in Queenstown, Tasmania, attending the Unconformity festival with Tassie arts champion Senator Anne Urquhart. My own electorate of Macquarie plays host to the Blue Mountains Writers' Festival this weekend, and I'm proud to be a sponsor of that important cultural event. It's always engaging and often thought provoking, and I know it will attract visitors and locals alike.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I see in common with all regional and remote areas is a desire that they be supported to tell their own stories on their terms and share them with the rest of the country. Given the central ambition of our new national cultural policy, Revive, is that there is a place for every story and a story for every place, here are some of the practical ways that we're realising that ambition. We're investing an additional $8.5 million over four years in the Regional Arts Fund, bringing the annual spend from $3.7 million to $5.8 million a year so more great regional artists and organisations can be supported to create and share their work. Creative Australia continues to be an important source of support for regional creativity, but under the coalition it was starved of the funding it needed to do its job when arts minister George Brandis raided the Australia Council budget in 2015. It was individual artists and small to medium arts organisations that were hit hardest, and it meant regional arts was badly hurt. Our $199 million in additional funding to Creative Australia over four years will expand the support it provides to the sector and allow more individual artists and more small to medium organisations to be supported right across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also supporting the development of cultural infrastructure in regional areas, such as the $13 million to develop the Burnie cultural precinct in Tassie, plus new support for Bundanon in the beautiful Shoalhaven region. I know the member for Gilmore, Fiona Phillips, has been a committed advocate for Bundanon, and I know she shares my delight that it will receive an additional $10 million a year to support its artists-in-residence and its gallery operations. We're also investing $12 million in the new Sharing the National Collection initiative, which will do long-term loans from the National Gallery of Australia to suburban and regional galleries throughout the country. Loans already announced include works by Monet and Margaret Olley to Tweed Regional Gallery in Murwillumbah, which I know the member for Richmond will be excited about; works by Imants Tillers and David Hockney to the Home of the Arts on the Gold Coast; and a work by Ron Mueck to Maitland Regional Art Gallery, which the member for Paterson tells me she's keen to see. There's much more to be done, and we're committed to backing regional artists because we recognise their contribution to vibrant, strong and prosperous regions.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:41</span>):  I like the member for Macquarie, but sometimes I think Labor members come into this place and want to read a shopping list of faults that came under the coalition's watch. It is not the truth. In the spirit of bipartisanship, here we go, I'm going to praise the Labor candidate who ran against me in 2013 and 2016. Thankfully he didn't win, and that's why I'm here. But Tim Kurylowicz is the executive director at Eastern Riverina Arts, and you know what? He's doing a good job. He stood beside me at the new arts precinct in Temora, federally funded by, wait for it, the coalition government. We were proud to open that facility because we know, as does the member for Macquarie, just how important regional arts funding is. I am happy to work alongside Tim to make sure arts gets its appropriate funding across the eastern Riverina, across the electorate, into places such as Temora, into large cities such as Wagga Wagga but the smaller towns and villages as well. As I said, he is doing a good job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion needs to also recognise and acknowledge that funding for the arts reached record levels under the coalition government. In fact it was not only printed in the budget papers but delivered in galleries right across the nation on the ground, and I know how important it was for the member for Bradfield, whose speaking spot I have taken—he has other things on at the moment—when COVID hit to make sure we got the funding out to events right across regional Australia in particular and right across the nation but also to the sorts of things we could keep going during those difficult and dark days. I know how important it was for him and for us as a coalition government and as an opposition now that funding should be as much as possible going to support artists, performers, arts workers, backstage crew, ushers, front of house—all of the people who work to deliver the arts and cultural activities that are so important to all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what we did in government, and that's what we will keep this government to account for in opposition. Annual Commonwealth arts funding reached a record level of $1 billion in 2021-22 under the coalition. Labor has not surpassed that. Labor members come in here and get their talking points from the dirt unit or the talking point department, wherever they get them from. They all do it. They all come in—it doesn't matter what motion we're talking about—they stand here and they just read every line as though it were the truth. Just because it's on the piece of paper, just because you've been told to say that, doesn't mean you have to blindly go along with it. We did put money into the arts. We did put money into artists, particularly during COVID. It was so tough and so difficult for all those artists during COVID. I think we all acknowledge that, and we all recognise the role they played in trying to lift spirits as best they could with the funding made available to them by the coalition government, by the nation, to help them during that very difficult period.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I appreciate that this is about artists, but it's also about show societies right throughout regional Australia—particularly for infrastructure upgrades. Some might say, 'What do show societies have to do with artists?' They actually employ a lot of artists. That's where, sometimes, the nation's budding artists have their first works displayed. The schoolchildren of the Riverina and central west, right throughout the regions, at the Sydney royal and elsewhere—that's where they get their first opportunity to display their talents, and that is why we provided so much money. In fact, 541 shows and events all around Australia were funded under our $200 million fund Restart Investment to Sustain and Expand—cleverly named 'RISE'. That was during COVID. We will continue to make sure arts and culture play an important part in this nation because they're important to the nation and they're important to our future.</span>

Safeguarding these for future generations is a key responsibility of any national government. This morning, I rise to speak in favour of the motion moved by the member for Macquarie and Special Envoy for the Arts. What a champion she is for the arts! I have been a proud advocate for our national cultural institutions for as long as I've been involved in public life. I'm pleased to be part of a government that recognises the need to ensure that these institutions who care for our arts and history are supported and celebrated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Across this country, there are thousands of diverse cultural organisations that make an immense positive contribution to our local, state and national story. As the member for Bean, co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of the Capital Region, and co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums—or GLAM—I am particularly proud to work with the cultural and historical organisations at both local and national levels, particularly those that have their home in our nation's capital and region. These institutions tell the stories of Australia from local heritage places such as Lanyon Homestead to establishments of national significance like the Museum of Australian Democracy and the National Gallery. Preserving and conserving our national heritage is a key priority of this government, and forms a central part of Revive, our new national cultural policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, I had the privilege of receiving a behind-the-scenes tour of the National Film and Sound Archive on the grounds of the Australian National University. The National Film and Sound Archive records our audiovisual history, from the first radio broadcast to episodes of <span style="font-style:italic;">Home </span><span style="font-style:italic;">and </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Away</span> and striking national moments like the 2008 National Apology to the Stolen Generations. With constantly changing technology and rapidly decaying film and video archives, the archivists and technicians at NFSA are in a race against time to preserve these aspects of our national story. These challenges require diverse and precise skills and instruments. For that, they're in greater need than ever of national support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Canberra was one of the largest victims of the former government's policy neglect when it came to the arts. For nine years, coalition arts ministers sat idle as crucial maintenance spending was spent on slush funds, and vital programs faced funding cliffs. An example of this was the National Library's Trove platform, which provides digital access to cultural collections throughout the country. For those living in regional and remote areas, it's particularly valuable. But under the previous government's plans, funding for this service is going to run out on 30 June this year. Thanks to the Albanese government's intervention, that funding was extended. After a decade of underfunding and neglect by the former government, this year's budget allocated over $535 million over the next four years to ensure ongoing and stable funding of the nine national collecting institutions, including the NFSA.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Prime Minister has said, these are special places, and we should be proud of them. They preserve, protect, and celebrate Australia's stories and history. This government is committed to preserving, protecting, and celebrating them. Not only does a well-funded creative and cultural industry bring so much to our lives as Australians but it's also fundamental to a strong national economy. Arts and cultural events organisations and institutions drive tourism, employment and economic development from our regions to our bigger cities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Revive, the new cultural policy championed by this government, will channel funding to support the $17 billion industry to rebound after a decade of coalition funding cuts and the devastation of the COVID pandemic. This policy will cover all aspects of our national cultural assets from creative arts to history and archiving. I would like to acknowledge the dedicated public servants, independent artists and musicians whose tireless and ongoing work and advocacy is so essential to enriching our lives and preserving our national history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the member for Macquarie for this motion, and the tireless work she has done to restore and grow the arts and regional arts sector that was left devastated by the COVID pandemic and nine years of Liberal-National government. I invite all in this House to come to the capital showcase this Wednesday, which will be an opportunity to match the providores of this region with the extraordinary national cultural institutions which will be on show for all to see.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VIOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:51</span>):  It is with pleasure that I rise to speak on this motion. It's a very important one. The arts has a big role to play in many regional communities. In the electorate of Casey, it's at the heart of what we do and who we are. For myself, personally, as the son of an artist and a musician, it is always nice to stand and talk about the arts. I've seen firsthand the impact it's had on my family, with my deep connection to the arts community throughout our area. It does so many things to bring us together to celebrate what is special about our community and about our country, but one of the things where the arts, in particular in my community, is so valuable is when it brings us together after a tragedy or a natural disaster. It allows people to heal, and not just those artists to heal, but the community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In June of 2021, my community was devastated by what we call the 'June storms'. Houses were without power for months. We were lucky that no lives were lost. We still do not know how no lives were lost. But trees, hundreds of feet tall, fell down. Houses were hit, and people experienced trauma as they were stuck in their houses, particularly on the Dandenong Ranges. They could just hear this terrible crash after crash in the darkness. I heard terrible stories of houses being split in half and half of the family at one end of the house and the other half of the family at the other end, not being able to communicate. Not knowing if their families were alive. We were fortunate that no-one was lost, as I said. But that trauma doesn't leave those people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But our community rallied after that. I want to pay particular credit to Burrinja in Upwey. They did many programs and many works for students and for artists to heal after the storms. It was a big part of our community. Burrinja is much loved, all through the Dandenong Ranges. They played a key role. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also fortunate, in September last year, to visit the Yarra Ranges Regional Museum for the opening of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Big Anxiety</span><span style="font-style:italic;">, </span>a dedicated program where those that had been impacted by the storms could share their stories. As everyone in this House knows, sometimes we are fortunate to meet amazing people and to listen to their stories. When those young people—teenagers and young adults—shared their stories and their trauma of that night, and how the arts helped them find a way forward, there wasn't a dry eye in the house. It is crucial that we continue to support the arts in every way we can.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite do like to run with a very standard line about nothing happening in the 10 years of the coalition government. The only problem with that is that it doesn't stack up with the facts and the budget, which is there in black and white. As the member for Riverina said, the $1 billion in funding in 2021-22 was record funding for the arts sector, but also, importantly, the $200 million in the Restart Investment to Sustain and Expand Fund, the RISE Fund, helped the arts community to get through COVID, to get on their feet. Again, Burrinja in my community was fortunate to receive funding from that program. I speak to Gareth Hart, the CEO, often. He talks about how crucial that funding was to keeping them going, to keeping the community going and, again, to keeping them connected and having something to celebrate in times of challenge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last Sunday, I was at Belgrave Heights. We were visiting for the launch of Carabiner Bench (Nature found no fault with me). That was a program at Birdsland Reserve in Belgrave, an outdoor spot to bring people together. It was about connection. It brought Tay, a lead artist, together with other artists to collaborate on an amazing project. People can sit, reflect and understand that nature does not judge you. It doesn't matter who you are, where you are, where you've been or where you're from. I think that is an important message we should all take in light of significant events here in Australia and overseas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the best part of that project was watching those young artists connect. None of them knew each other at the start of the project, but looking at them talking, laughing and spending time together it was like they'd been friends for a lifetime. That's the power of the arts. That's why I'll always support additional funding for our arts community.</span>

The imperative of support for Australia's creative industries has never been more important. The industry broadly encapsulates many diverse mediums, such as theatre, film and television, music, literature, dance and video games, to just name a few broad categories. That's not to mention the contribution of the GLAM sector—galleries, libraries, archives and museums—integral to many others as the preservers, curators and purveyors of so many forms of cultural expression. For many kids, a good librarian can be a catalyst to unlocking a child's desire to not just read but also learn, regardless of where they live or go to school. This reinforces the point that the arts are not just a luxury for the privileged few; they are a necessity for all.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many tourists from abroad might think of Australia through the romanticised images of red dirt and the vast expanses of our outback. Many tourists become encouraged to visit and breathe in the many beautiful landscapes throughout our country. As we all know, portraying it on screen can only do its beauty so much justice. This means tourism and a source of income for many regional townships.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can largely say the same of Labor governments since then. It has exclusively been Labor prime ministers to set the tone of a national cultural policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first national cultural policy was formulated under the prime ministership of Paul Keating, with the next being under Julia Gillard. It has fallen upon a Labor Prime Minister to do so yet again. As we know, the art and culture of a nation is reflective of national character by virtue of either its existence or its absence. On one side, there has been a party that when in government fosters the growth of the arts. On the other side you have, in the words of Paul Keating, those steeped in cultural cringe. I think our public discourse could benefit greatly if some of us embraced more culture and fewer culture wars. For some, sadly, the last time they immersed themselves in culture it involved accidentally spilling a tub of yoghurt on themselves. Who am I to dictate the way that culture is to ultimately be consumed or enjoyed?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud of Labor's commitment to the arts, fostering the creative industries that contribute so widely and so greatly to our unique cultural growth in Australia, industries that have been in dire need of support and assistance not just due to the detrimental impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic but also from nine long years of cultural cringe by a government that seemingly substituted this for an arts policy of their own. I remember the member for Cook posing with Guy Sebastian in an effort to drum up goodwill for an industry that had, by then, been gutted by the ravages of COVID, an experience that left even Guy feeling short-changed in a number of respects. It was always an interesting choice to set up a photo op with an Australian Idol standing next to an Australian identity best known by all for being idle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thankfully, we now have a Labor Prime Minister at the helm, who, along with the Minister for the Arts and the Special Envoy for the Arts, released our new national cultural policy, which occurred a few months ago: 'Revive, a place for every story, a story for every place'. It is a terrific way to encapsulate a lot of what Gough mentioned back in 1972. It is a way of saying that everyone can have an opportunity to contribute to culture and creative expression in Australia, regardless of where you hail from. As a Labor government, we look to provide certainty to the creative sector that funding is not contingent on the tastes, proclivities or other predispositions held by any given politician. The Albanese Labor government recognises that we are worse off as a nation when we don't invest in the arts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Australia is not contributing to our own zeitgeist, building upon our cultural infrastructure, we risk having others set it on our own behalf. But, at the very least, the broader arts sector should be safe in the knowledge that Labor will continue to stand up and support it, to help it to grow in fair-weather conditions and to endure the foul-weather conditions, too. Labor places great value and importance on the contribution the sector makes to our enduring cultural identity, to our economy and to how we are perceived abroad. Thank you for the work you do to entertain us and— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="265980" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SHARKIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:01</span>):  I'm delighted to speak on this motion about Revive, because Revive commits new funding to creativity in regional Australia, including in my electorate of Mayo. Mayo is one of the most creative hotspots in the nation, and this was really on show during the South Australian Living Arts Festival. We affectionately refer to that as SALA. The festival celebrated 25 years, with over 600 venues and 9,000 artists, and truly provided a feast for the senses. We have a thriving community arts scene throughout the year, from the Adelaide Hills, down the Fleurieu and on to Kangaroo Island, and they are well supported by community, because we value art in every medium. I thought I'd mention just a few of those. We've got Ink Pot Arts, the Stirling Players, Yankalilla Youth Theatre, the Hills School of Theatre Arts, the Stirling Community Theatre, the Adelaide Hills Performing Arts Centre, Adelaide Hills Rockit Performing Arts, Theatre Bugs, the South Coast Choral and Arts Society, the JamaeRaw School Of Performing Arts, Fortuna House of Performing Arts, Fleurieu Dance Collective, and Laughing Llama Dance and Drama. They're just the performing arts organisations in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my time as the member for Mayo I have met with so many groups who are seeking to create spaces to develop their passions, whether it's music, song, dance or theatre, and for people of all ages, which is really important. Yvette Wolf established the Yankalilla Youth Theatre and has shared with me her vision for the theatre's future, about the ways she does workshops. She wants to encourage all young people, particularly young people who don't necessarily gravitate to sport. We need to make sure we've got exciting spaces and opportunities to let all young people thrive. And the Stirling Players—I'm one of their patrons. Last year they celebrated 50 years, and I've got to say, I do love going along, particularly to their opening nights. I've seen so many wonderful productions with the Stirling Players. And Ink Pot Arts offer regular workshops for children, young people and adults, from dance and drama to creative writing and improv sessions. They make art accessible to everyone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know there is a strong relationship between the development of cognitive capacity through visual arts and improvements in academic and social performance. Artistic expression has helped develop individual creativity and self-expression as well as the critical thinking and problem-solving skills that we all need. Henri Matisse said that creativity takes courage. And it takes courage for people to get up on that stage, to sing, to dance, to write and to share their soul with all of us. We can draw on personal experience in shaping that soul and shaping that story. Revive provides a platform through which to recognise the contribution of artists and societies and to allow us all to enjoy and watch them flourish.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to end by listing a few of the galleries, and I hope I haven't missed anyone. We've got Hahndorf Academy, The Cedars, UKARIA Cultural Centre—I was recently there for an amazing performance by a New York jazz musician—the Hills Sculpture Trail, Crystal Lake Sculpture Park at Macclesfield, Fabrik at Lobethal, the Lucent Art House, the Top of the Torrens Gallery in Birdwood, the Coach House Studio in Gumeracha, Atelier in Crafers, the Bamfurlong Fine Crafts, Field Trip in Balhannah, the Aboriginal Art House in Hahndorf, Tineriba Tribal Gallery and Tineriba Fine Arts in Hahndorf, The Strand Gallery at Port Elliot and Gallery 45 also in Port Elliot. We've also got ArtWorx Gallery in Goolwa, Art@Goolwa Inc., Sand Drift Gallery at Goolwa, the Signal Point Gallery at Goolwa—that's incredibly important and undergoing renovations—the Victor Harbour Regional Gallery, the Coral Street Art Space, the Ocean Blue Arts, Yankalilla Yarns and Fine Arts Studio/Gallery, Gallery88 at Yankalilla, Fine Art Kangaroo Island Gallery, Shep's Studio, the Kangaroo Island Gallery and the Baudin Beach Artworks Gallery that I would absolutely recommend to everyone in my community. When you go to Kangaroo Island, make sure you get to the Baudin Beach Artworks Gallery. I bought some beautiful little Christmas presents there not too long ago. I'm not even mentioning the wonderful illustrators in my electorate that are illustrating children's books, those who are painting murals across our community. Art truly fills our soul with joy and makes our community feel alive. I thank all of the artists that live in Mayo. I send great support to you all.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion gives us a real insight into the Albanese government. The failure to provide a funding commitment, to provide funding certainty, for the Stronger Communities Program gives us a glimpse of what lies at the heart and the soul of this government. Ever since coming to office last year, the government has continued to cut programs in regional areas where the communities had a direct say in their local priorities. It's more of the same with the Stronger Communities Program. This is a government that thinks Canberra knows best. It thinks it knows best. It simply doesn't trust local communities to come up with local solutions and local priorities for the expenditure of taxpayers' money. At a time when communities, households, families are dealing with increased cost-of-living pressures, this government is taking away a funding program which helps the sporting clubs and community organisations fund small infrastructure initiatives that would otherwise be paid for by the hard work of volunteers—in other words paid for by the mums and dads who pay subscriptions or actually raise money for those clubs and organisations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The hypocrisy of those opposite, particularly the ministers, is they come in here and talk about the wasted years of the coalition government. They lecture us about the supposed years where nothing was built and nothing was achieved. But then they go back to their electorates, and they're the first ones to turn up to cut the ribbons. They're the first ones to turn up to take credit for projects they had absolutely nothing to do with. The minister for infrastructure, who's the minister responsible for the Stronger Communities Program, is a repeat offender in this regard. She's traipsing around the country taking credit for road projects, bridge projects, community projects—things she had absolutely nothing to do with. All Minister King has delivered in the 18 months since gaining office is a 90-day review which has now taken 169 days. We still haven't seen the outcomes of her 90-day review 169 days later. If you see a grader, if you see a crane or if you see a bulldozer working anywhere on a major public infrastructure project in Australia today, I can assure you of one thing—Minister King had nothing to do with it. She's funded nothing and delivered nothing in her term as the infrastructure minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Stronger Communities Program was so successful because it actually worked. It was fair. It provided an allocated amount of funding to every electorate in Australia—$150,000. Members formed a panel with local community groups, local communities were able to make their submissions, and they were able to leverage off that small amount of funding to deliver something practical and tangible in every electorate in Australia. There were 15,000 projects funded under the Stronger Communities Program. I would humbly argue, as a lower house member from a large regional seat, that the only fault with the program is we probably should have got a bit more, because the program was so oversubscribed that we had to turn back equally as many projects as we were able to actually fund.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What do Labor do? We have a highly successful, fairly allocated model of funding, and what do Labor do? They abolish it. You always have to be careful, with the modern Labor Party, to watch what they do, not listen to what they say. Minister King put out a press release earlier this year, and Minister King's press release said in relation to the Stronger Communities Program: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Every single community in Australia is unique, and the Albanese Government recognises that local governments, community organisations and that people who live in their region best understand their local priorities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She loved the program so much she failed to deliver any ongoing funding for it. She loved it so much she abolished it, cut it—finished. It's gone. Those opposite will say that it will be the subject of future budget rounds. The member for Fowler asked the Treasurer a question on 2 August about the Stronger Communities Program, and this is what the Treasurer had to say: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The matter of future rounds of Stronger Communities will be the subject, no doubt, of future budget deliberations, but there was no allocation for Stronger Communities beyond round 8.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is Treasury code for, 'It's gone—it's abolished.' Labor isn't funding those small community groups to obtain this funding going forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to those opposite, with all sincerity: stop taking credit for the previous government's infrastructure and communities program. It's much more fun as a government if you do something yourselves. It's much more fun to make good decisions and fund programs and then take all the credit you want for them. I also say to those opposite: this was a fair program with an allocated model of funding. Your electorates benefited just as much as ours did, and our communities deserve a fair go, and this government is not giving it to them. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300130" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LIM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:12</span>):  When I was elected as the federal Labor member for Tangney, it was a very humbling moment for me. Being a federal member means that I have the largest platform to impact meaningful changes and communicate the views of my electorate's constituents, who feel they have not been heard by their previous member. Outside of helping constituents and their respective groups with their queries and problems and listening to their feedback on the government, there was always one very common denominator question: they would ask me about funding. Where can they find the money to help fund a particular cause? Being in government let me understand that there is funding available for communities—funds that can be spent to improve facilities, help with availability of resources and, most importantly, help build a community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, as we all know, when we came into government, we encountered debt—$1 trillion of debt. Clearly, there's not as much money as we'd like to have. The Stronger Communities grants program is a significant program, one which has undoubtedly provided many benefits and played a significant role in supporting small-scale projects within our communities. However, times change and priorities shift. It is our responsibility as a society and as a government to adapt and make the most effective use of our resources, of which money plays a big part. By redirecting funds to other programs, we can better address the evolving needs of our nation, ensuring that the Australian people receive the maximum benefit for their tax dollars.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First and foremost, let's acknowledge that there's still money for our communities. There's money in the form of grants, and reprioritisation of these funds is not an attack on the principles that guided the Stronger Communities grants program. Instead, it is recognition that there are other pressing needs that require our attention. It is important to note that we also have the immensely popular Volunteer Grants program, which is one of the grants programs that still have members of parliament involved in the nomination process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to share a story with you regarding grant funding. When I was newly elected, I came to understand that there were so many people in my electorate of Tangney who did not know that there was government grant money they could apply for. When I first became aware of the volunteer grants, the previous member had had only one organisation apply for 2021 and 2022 and be successful for just under $2,500. What happened to the remaining $60,000-plus? It was not allocated at all. So I made sure that the communities in my electorate of Tangney were aware of this grant and how to apply accordingly. I can happily say that 28 applications were successful for funding last year, and this year we have put forward 35 applications for consideration. I eagerly await the outcome of this later this month.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone here knows that our constituents are crying out about the cost of living. It is essential to note that our country is currently facing economic challenges, which our government is addressing. Redirecting funds from the Stronger Communities grants program to other programs will enable our government to optimise our budget allocation and make targeted investments in areas that will foster economic growth and job creation. Our government's decision to redirect funds from the Stronger Communities grants program to other programs should be viewed as an adaptation to the challenging needs of our nation. It is a responsible approach to resource allocation, which is part of our government's commitment to addressing the concern regarding everyday Australians and ensuring that our local communities can continue to thrive.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300120" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PIKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:17</span>):  I thank the member for Gippsland for raising this important issue and providing an opportunity for us to debate it. It is an issue that I've been explaining to a lot of the constituents within my electorate, particularly about the impact that this cut will have on their operations and my ability to support them as their local member. Of course, these are the sorts of projects that don't fit neatly within other funding opportunities from the federal government. These are the things that will slip through the cracks without this dedicated funding. It has enabled many local projects and initiatives in my electorate that simply would not otherwise have been possible. Community organisations have been able to enhance their services and infrastructure to the benefit of our community and the lives of local Redland residents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Stronger Communities Program provided a guarantee of funding that was specifically earmarked for each community, whether that be the community that I represent or the community that you represent, Deputy Speaker. Each community that those of us here represent has an earmarked allocation. It is incredibly fair. The government's decision to end this program removes this guarantee, and it will have a real impact on the capacity of local community and sporting organisations across Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll give you some examples of some of the projects that were funded through this program within my electorate. We were able to secure $17,000 for the Volunteer Marine Rescue Victoria Point. They were able to use that funding to replace ageing touch screens for their GPS navigation devices on their primary vessel. These are all volunteers who are working hard to assist locals when they become caught in issues within Moreton Bay. They've been able to use that funding that they wouldn't have otherwise received.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was out at the Cage Youth Foundation at Redland Bay the other day, and they used a $10,000 grant through this program to purchase new social enterprise equipment. They run a social enterprise. They undertake a whole heap of mowing, graffiti removal and other services across the electorate, and they use that to support disengaged youth. They were able to purchase a brand new mower off the back of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Out at North Stradbroke Island, the rugby league club was able to purchase shade sails for the main oval there. Point Lookout Surf Life Saving Club received $20,000 for the replacement of a four-wheel drive patrol vehicle. On Wednesday evening last week, I was out at Redlands College and saw the Special Olympics Redlands branch basketballers, who had been kitted out with new singlets, new basketballs and new training equipment through a $3,900 grant. These are the sorts of smaller grants that simply aren't available through any other mechanism. Yes, we have volunteer grants, as the previous speaker spoke about, but that's a fraction of what was invested through Stronger Communities. I'm deeply concerned that projects like this will not be funded within my electorate and across Australia due to these cuts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently signed a joint letter to the minister, alongside 24 local community organisations, to express our community's concern regarding the scrapping of the Stronger Communities Program and the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program and changes to the eligibility conditions of the Growing Regions Program which will exclude projects within the Redlands. All of these funding streams have been critical in securing much-needed investment in the Redlands. I strongly encourage the Labor government to reconsider its approach to these programs and to ensure our community can continue to benefit from an equitable share of investment. I think it's important. That's all we're asking for. This wasn't a huge amount of money in the scheme of the federal government's expenditure, but these smaller funds were a way that we could directly assist these community and sporting groups.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll touch on the Growing Regions Program, which we also mentioned was of deep concern to us. Under the previous government, through the Building Better Regions Fund, we were able to secure North Stradbroke Island and the Southern Moreton Bay Islands in my electorate as eligible areas for that program. Under the Growing Regions program, those islands have now been excluded. It's an absurd situation where Surfers Paradise can now claim regional funding while projects on the Moreton Bay islands, which are considered to be in the fourth percentile of the SEIFA index on social disadvantage, are unable to access this investment. That's just another reason why we are more reliant on the Stronger Communities Program for me to be able to direct or help to influence the direction of that fund to better support the disadvantaged areas of my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We strongly encourage the government to reconsider the decisions being made to cut funding to the Stronger Communities Program and the other programs I've mentioned to enable projects on our Bay islands and on the Redlands mainland to continue to receive our fair share of investment.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:22</span>):  One of the amazing things about being a local MP is getting to talk with and support so many wonderful local community groups and organisations through a variety of grants. The amount of work and effort local people pour into our communities is truly inspiring. I am always thrilled to get out and about to see what local people are doing. These organisations give so much. Today I want to talk about one of the ways that I help give back: the Stronger Communities Program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For this latest round in my region, 17 local organisations have received a share of $134,500 in grants. It's a real thrill to be able to provide funding to organisations that do such amazing work to support our communities. For instance, this round, $17,000 was provided to Marine Rescue NSW in Batemans Bay to upgrade their facilities, which will include an upgraded training room. Marine Rescue is such an important organisation and I love nothing more than helping them improve their operational capabilities to make sure they can continue to help keep boaters on our waterways safe.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Kiama Table Tennis Club with their $3,000 grant will purchase new equipment to support their growing membership. I've been to the club and seen them in action—a room full of people enjoying this great sport and making valuable social connections. This investment in the Kiama Table Tennis Club will help build a sense of community and provide opportunities for residents of all ages, and I'm proud to have been able to support them. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jervis Bay Meals on Wheels have used their $5,000 grant to purchase a new industrial potato peeler and create a new vegetable preparation area. Recently, I met with Meals on Wheels volunteers as they prepared meals and then went out on a few delivery runs. This isn't only a food delivery service; it is a much-valued community service. The volunteers know the people they're delivering to and provide an incredible level of care to them. I'm so happy I could support such a group that does so much for so many.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Jamberoo Country Women's Association are using their $3,000 to purchase updated audiovisual equipment. The CWA is such an important meeting place for the community, and it's satisfying to be able to help them improve their meetings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The community owned Gerringong Golf Club received $17,500 to improve fuel storage on site. This club is member owned, and this money will help keep the member prices down so the community can continue to enjoy this wonderful club. Providing $16,500 in funding to the Sussex Inlet District Chamber of Commerce to build a new walking path from Swanhaven to Sussex Inlet Public School is just the best idea.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another group who received funding is the Flagstaff Group. They are a not-for-profit social enterprise providing life skills and work for people with disabilities. Flagstaff have received $8,000 in funding to improve the EMBER app they've developed to help people living with a disability prepare for bushfires and other natural disasters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Boomerang Meeting Place in Mogo received $16,000 in funding to put in a new solar system on their men's shed, supporting the community and keeping their power prices down, and the list goes on. The Tomakin Community Association is using $18,000 to upgrade local basketball facilities. The Tuross Community Gardens has used $3,000 to install another water tank to store and catch rainwater. The Moruya RSL subbranch received $3,500 to improve their memorial gardens. The Shoalhaven Heads Native Botanic Garden received $5,000 to update their signs, and the Culburra Dolphins junior rugby league club received $2,500 to replace canteen equipment. The Callala Bay Progress Hall management committee received $2,500 to buy a new ride-on mower, and the Burrill Lake Community Association received $4,000 for equipment to maintain the Barker Reserve. I'm immensely proud to be able to deliver and support these 15 projects, which spanned from Kiama to Tuross Head.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, not every project can get funding through this program, but I just want to say thank you to all the community organisations in our region. If you're involved in a community organisation, I would love to come and meet with you and your members to see the wonderful work you're doing and how I can help to match you with available grants. To all the community organisations in our region: thanks for all the wonderful work you do. Your efforts make our communities thrive, and it fills me with pride to be part of our incredible region. Your dedication and hard work is truly inspiring. You most certainly are making our communities stronger.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Durack</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:27</span>):  I rise today to raise my objection to the Albanese government's terrible decision to abandon the very successful Stronger Communities Program. This program was designed to deliver social benefits across Australia through funding of grassroots projects right across Australia. The program provided equal funding across each electorate, irrespective of the political affiliation of the local member. Each electorate had an available pool of $150,000 for local not-for-profit groups to apply for grants of between $2,500 and $20,000.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since being established by the coalition in 2015, the program has helped fund over 15,000 local community based projects. This includes plenty of worthy projects in my electorate of Durack that were assisted by the program, from the Mid West through to the Kimberley. Projects in Durack included funding for groups like the Broome Basketball Association; the Derby Speedway Club, an excellent club; and an organisation called Feed the Little Children, which is based in Broome. Such groups, particularly in regional Australia, recognise these grants as an invaluable contribution to their work in supporting their local communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since coming to government, we've seen that Minister King has failed to grasp the importance of this program. Round 8 of the program was left in limbo for nine long months but finally opened for applications in February of this year, with a closing date of 16 May. It is an indictment of the government that the minister could not deliver this program on time. Honestly, what are they doing, and what sort of show is she running? Applications closed almost a year after the election. Remember, this is a program the regional development department was very experienced in delivering. Multiple programs have been delivered since 2015, so they can't say it was some new, innovative program they had no experience in running. They have rolled out previous rounds before. What was going on?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen Labor members, in this debate, talk about how wonderful the program is, and it's great to hear how they have appreciated the program. During the last sitting, the member for McEwen stood up and spoke of the 'powerful impact' that the Stronger Communities Program was having on community groups in his electorate. I'm so pleased to hear him say that. In his speech, he acknowledged how the program enabled local organisations to make a meaningful difference within the community. I'm glad that some members opposite—and I'm sure we'll hear from a few more members in this debate—appreciate the success of the program, but it is a real shame that they've not been able to have adequately argued for its continuation within the Labor Party party room. In the May budget, no money has been allocated for a 2023-24 round, and no money has been allocated for a 2024-25 round. This is a disgrace, and it's a real letdown for so many community groups right across Australia because it seems that the Labor leadership has little interest in supporting community organisations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, there is now no small-scale grant program that offers Commonwealth assistance to grassroots organisations. This is shameful. I appreciate that we are living through a cost-of-living crisis and acknowledge the need for spending restraint during the inflationary environment that we are in, but it is important to note that the minimal cost of this very successful program—just $22.7 million—was allocated for round 8 of the program. I, for one, believe that the $365 million that was allocated by this government to hold the referendum on Saturday could have been used much more effectively. The same amount of money could have funded another 16 rounds of the same scale—supporting many worthy thousands of local clubs and groups. Without the ability to access Commonwealth grants, many community organisations—including sporting groups—will have no option but to increase fees to parents and children to participate in sports. Given we're living through a crisis with respect to the cost of living, that's the last thing parents need at the moment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to understand that this is not the only initiative being scrapped by this government. In fact, this is just one of the many successful programs abandoned by the Labor government. In their first budget, Labor cut more than $10 billion in regional and community programs. They abolished the Community Development Grants Program, the Energy Security and Regional Development Plan, the Regional Accelerator Program, the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program, and the Building Better Regions Fund. This so-called 90-day roads infrastructure review is nowhere to be seen. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:32</span>):  It has been a privilege and an honour being the federal member for Robertson since my election in May of 2022. Over my time in office, I have had the opportunity to meet with a range of outstanding organisations based in my electorate. These charities and not-for-profit organisations are the backbone of my community and of many communities across the country. They work diligently to support people who might be doing it tough or to be places for people to come together. The Albanese Labor government funded round 8 of the Stronger Communities Program in the October 2022 federal budget. This was despite the former Liberal government failing to fund round 8 and failing to fund many of the other projects that they were raving on about during the last election. Round 8 of the Stronger Communities Program provided local organisations with grant funding of between $2,500 and $20,000 for infrastructure projects.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the Robertson community grants committee, several organisations were selected and are now benefiting—for example, several men's sheds in my region. Men's Sheds are phenomenal organisations for men of all ages. The men's shed movement is one of the most powerful organisations for helping men address their healthcare issues and improve wellbeing. They allow men to be a part of something bigger and put their time to good use by supporting their local community through a range of diverse work. One such men's shed that we have been able to support is the Broadlands Residents Men's Shed in Green Point. Just the other week, they celebrated their second birthday, which I was fortunate to attend and see some of the marvellous projects they have been working on. I congratulate the Broadlands Residents Men's Shed on their second birthday milestone. This group of men meet regularly to work on projects such as toys for disadvantaged kids and supporting local primary schools. Importantly, it is a place for its members to belong to, which promotes a great sense of camaraderie. Through our support, the Broadlands Residents Men's Shed in Green Point received over $7,000 to put towards the cost of a new concrete slab. This new concrete slab enabled the men's shed to increase their working space as their membership continues to grow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As their membership has grown, so has the need to have more working space for its members to work safely in, and I was pleased to see during my visit that the concrete slab has been poured and the project has now been completed. Already the additional working space is allowing more members to participate in these projects. As a health professional I understand how important social connections are to our overall health and wellbeing. Men's sheds provide so much support to men of all ages, and I'm a huge supporter of their work. To all the men involved with the Broadlands Residents Men's Shed, thank you for your dedication to improving our community and supporting your mates. You are all outstanding members of our community, and we appreciate the contributions you make to strengthening our region. It has been a great pleasure meeting with you all and getting to know you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I just say a special thanks to all of the members of this men's shed in Green Point for the fantastic work they do: Alan Sparkes, Barry Evans, Barry Tanswell, Chris Neilssen, Chris Mackett, Colin Scott, David Halliwell, Gary King, Geoffrey Turner, Graham Hurrell, Graham Pollock, John Moore, John Moriarty, John Sherrington, Kevin Ivins, Noel Price, Patrick Fry, Peter Jacobs, Peter Thompson, Philip Barclay, Robert McHue, Thomas Yates and Trevor Dowse. Thank you for all the outstanding work you do on the Central Coast and particularly within the electorate of Robertson, supporting organisations, schools and community groups right across the region. You do an amazing job. I thank each and every one of you. I also thank all of your amazing supporters, partners and wives for being part of that community. At that second birthday milestone you were all there around the barbecue, having a cup of coffee. Seeing the amazing work you do is truly inspirational, and I'm not just limiting it to the men's shed at Green Point; we have men's sheds right across the Central Coast. I know everyone here in this chamber right now has some outstanding men's sheds, and we thank them for the amazing work they do right across this great country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:37</span>):  I commend the member for Gippsland for this important motion. I know the member for Moreton this morning in the House had to double-check he was speaking on the right motion, and listening to those opposite I had to do the same. I thought I'd better get it out and just make sure. We don't want to make that mistake. Listening to those opposite talk about how amazing this program is and how much it's doing for their communities, they're very happy to stand up and talk about the programs delivering for their communities, which is great, because they are, as the member for Robertson said, delivering a lot for their communities. But what they're not talking about is point (2)(a) of this motion, which says the government has failed to provide funding for future rounds of the program, with no replacement for small-scale projects. They're not prepared to go and talk to the Prime Minister, talk to the Treasurer and advocate for this program privately or publicly, as we've seen today, but they're happy to stand there and take all the credit from the former government's funding and initiation of this program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sure the member for Moreton next will no doubt stand up and talk about the great things being delivered for his community. I implore him to stand up and publicly call on the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to continue to fund this program because it delivers for communities, and we all know it delivers for communities. I had the great privilege on Saturday of visiting the Yarra Glen fire brigade. Yarra Glen is my home town. It's where I grew up and spend my life. Through this program they were able to fund three thermal-imaging cameras. Talking to Captain Bill Boyd and meeting the team on the weekend, they were talking about how those cameras are going to make their jobs safer. With those cameras they can look and find hotspots the eye cannot see. Our community lived through Black Saturday. I lived through Black Saturday. Everyone knows the dangers CFAs put themselves through. This program has made it safer for those volunteers in Yarra Glen to protect our community, but this government is going to cut this program. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also about saving lives. The Lilydale community are benefiting from the Lilydale Community House having a defib on the outside of the building. They could not afford that defib without this program. I was there for the opening. It's right next to the bowls club. The bowls club have a defib as well, but that's inside and locked away. This one is available to the public at any time. There is no way they can raise those funds without this program. But this government have cut it, and those opposite will stand up and talk about how great it is, but they won't talk to their Prime Minister. They won't call out their Treasurer for not delivering for my community and for their communities. That is hypocrisy writ large.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, it's important in saving lives, but it's important in bringing communities together as well. I was fortunate, two weeks ago, to visit the Kallista market, which reopened after having to close down through COVID. I was at their first meeting earlier this year, when the group decided to restart the market, and talked to them about options. I said, 'We've got this great program for volunteers like you that you should apply for.' This money allowed them to get marquees, to get generators and to re-engage with their community. The atmosphere and the vibe at Kallista two weeks ago on that Saturday was amazing. There was music. There were stalls. Businesses were making money. The school had their fete. They were fundraising. The shops were as busy as they've ever been. The Dandenong Ranges have been through some tough times. It's a tourism town. Through COVID and through the storms, they've been doing it tough, but the energy, the passion and the community connection was there. We got to open that and I got to speak to the committee. Without this program and without this funding, they wouldn't have been able to continue to move forward like they did. Many other organisations helped them as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've got tens and tens of examples, just on this round, but there are hundreds and thousands of community groups across the nation that have benefited from this program in my community in Victoria and in many other seats. It is absolutely disgraceful that this government will cut this funding with no alternative. We all know that community groups are struggling with volunteers and struggling to fundraise. When you look at their faces and you see the joy that these couple of thousands of dollars bring, changing their organisations—this funding needs to be reinstated. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:42</span>):  I'm very glad to speak on this motion put forward by the member for Gippsland. I know he's had a bit of a tough time in his area lately. I know that in my electorate of Moreton, community groups look forward to the annual announcement of the expressions of interest for Stronger Communities grants. The capped amount of $150,000 to fund up to 20 local projects just isn't enough. It's always oversubscribed; we've got lots of wonderful community groups. Funding for those small infrastructure builds for community groups is much loved and much appreciated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The funds in Moreton in the past have gone towards: installing kitchens in local clubs to help groups with their fundraising efforts; buying mobile coffee machines to skill-up volunteers in barista skills, leading to more employment opportunities in hospitality; helping sporting clubs refurbish change rooms; and allowing local kindies to build beautiful outdoor playgrounds. Each member of parliament knows that the program is an annual fixture for our local groups—it's grassroots activism rewarded throughout the nation. I think the member for Gippsland is a good bloke, and I'm happy to put that on the record—others might speak against that, depending on where the National Party's merry-go-round is placed at the moment! When he had fire and floods within 24 hours, his electorate has had it tough. But I fail to see why the member for Gippsland has brought this motion, because he has clearly forgotten what his party did when he was in government. He's here today claiming that the future years of the Stronger Communities Programme haven't been funded, when his own government failed to fund the round they announced in March 2022. This is a program that has traditionally been funded—</span>

                  </a>  Well, not in March 2022 you hadn't. Not yet. In March 2022, you were still in government. As I said, I don't know where the National Party merry-go-round was parked at that particular time in terms of whether the good Deputy Prime Minister was in, or the other one. As the member for Gippsland knows, this program has traditionally been funded year-on-year. It's ridiculous for the coalition to claim they didn't do the same when they were in government. This is pure mischief-making. To quote the earlier speaker, it is hypocrisy writ large. Our last round of the program, round 8, was funded by the Albanese government and commenced in February 2023. While the Liberals and Nationals announced round 8 of Stronger Communities in the March budget, they failed to pass their budget before calling the election, meaning that the program was another unfunded promise. Once again, the Liberals and Nationals made an announcement, a press release, but failed to deliver, leaving it up to the Albanese Labor government to fix another part of their mess.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why we had to deliver the funding for round 8 of the program in the October budget of 2022 and roll out the program across 2023. Those opposite didn't deliver any funds for round 8 and certainly didn't make provision for funding beyond that. I should also point out that in round 8 the government added the requirement for local MPs to outline the project nomination process to enhance the transparency of the program, because we all remember the integrity issues around the coalition when it comes to grant programs. I'm sure the member for Lalor will remember the old colour-coded pork barrelling. Remember that? As a government, we deliver grant programs that are fair and transparent. I don't think we're going to see swimming pools next to the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Remember that? A swimming pool next to the Sydney Harbour Bridge—for a regional grants program! We actually know where the regions are.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the Building Better Regions Fund program, the Australian National Audit Office found that the Morrison government not only actively ignored Commonwealth grant programs but tried to get around them, and they did so at the expense of regional seats. If only the regional seats had a party that would speak up for them! If only they had a party like that! It was not only Labor seats but also regional seats held by Liberal and Independent members and National Party members. It's clear that projects on the merit list were ignored, and 65 per cent of the projects in the infrastructure stream, which made up almost all of the billion-dollar program, were not the ones assessed by the department as having the most merit. The Nationals seats benefited the most, as proper process was actively ignored. Those seats got $104 million more pork, or 29 per cent, than if the proper process had been followed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On that basis alone, the Liberal and National parties, especially the Nationals, should never again be allowed to talk about grants programs in this parliament, after the way they behaved while they were in government. Remember that, the shameful colour-coded trail of pork left across the nation in National Party seats? We don't know where the National Party merry-go-round is going to end up, but I hope the member for Gippsland thinks long and hard about his motions.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:47</span>):  We've just had five minutes from the member for Moreton, who once famously said, 'If a country road hasn't had a lick of bitumen on it for 70 years, why would you bitumen it now?' That's what he thought about a country dirt road that was getting an upgrade under the Nationals in government. The other thing I'll take him up on is colour-coded spreadsheets. The only trouble with the colour-coded spreadsheets under this mob is that they're all red; they're all the same colour, and they're all Labor. I commend the member for Gippsland for bringing forward this motion on the Stronger Communities program. When it comes to accountability, what could be more accountable than $150,000 per electorate, with community members having a say in where their federal funds go? Well, that's what I did. I called together a wonderful team—believe it or not, I had some Labor members on that team—to help me decide where the funding was going to go in some of the grants programs that we were rolling out across the Riverina and central west.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I doubt whether those opposite could run a chook raffle. The member for Gippsland and the member for Mallee have probably been in a pub on a Friday night and seen chook raffles happening. You have to have a lot of chook raffles, which many of our volunteer organisations put on, to raise the sorts of funds they need for the sort of spending they're going to do: just to buy a photocopier, just to put a coat of paint on a set of goalposts, just to put a disabled parking sign in a car park—all of those things. Indeed, that's how, in the past, they had to do it—until the coalition came along and thought up this program, which is very responsible, very accountable and very appropriate. What is has done is provide those community organisations with funds so they didn't have to go out every Friday night and run chook raffles in the pub to raise funds for their valuable organisations. Let me tell you, the Stronger Communities Program has both changed lives and saved lives. We heard earlier about providing defibrillator machines to sporting clubs and for other volunteer organisations. I know that even in my own electorate the Ganmain Grong Grong Matong Lions Football and Netball Club—and it's important that I get that name right, because I think it was the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald </span>that once called it the 'Ganmain Grong Grong mating lions'; it is Matong not 'mating', important distinction there!—had a barbecue area provided under this program that cost $7,500. It's pretty tough for those three wonderful little towns in the Riverina and Farrer electorates—Grong Grong is actually in Farrer, just across the electorate border—to come up with the sorts of funds that are going to provide for that necessary amenity which provides not only a barbecue for the footballers and netballers but also, during bushfires and during those other moments of community distress, a central point in the town to talk about their mental health, to talk about their struggles, and to talk about being and living in a rural community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll go through some: Trundle has its War Memorial School of Arts' hall upgrade; Illabo Sporting Bodies Incorporated upgraded their clubhouse; West Wyalong has renewed the commemorative walkway honouring our wonderful veterans—those who have served and those who have sacrificed in wars past and conflicts present; in Coolamon Shire, Beckom has a mobile skate park and pump track; at Parkes, the Currajong Disability Services has had building modifications for disability access, making sure that everybody is included when they hold community events; Woodstock, which is just a little community has had improvements to Lions Park; and at Cootamundra Men's Shed—and we all love our men's sheds—there was the building of disabled parking. That was a $10,000 grant. You can imagine the men's shed trying to raise funds out of fixing chairs and fixing stools to get enough funding to put disabled parking access into the important men's shed at Cootamundra. I commend this motion. I thank the member for Gippsland for bringing it to the House, because it is important. Why the program has been stopped is anyone's guess. No doubt, somebody in the Labor dirt unit knows. They probably thought it was getting votes for the National Party—how wrong they were! It's stopping good people in regional areas from getting the funding they deserve.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased today to rise to move this private member's motion that acknowledges the Albanese government working for Australia by delivering our commitment to strengthen Medicare and make it easier to see a doctor after a decade of cuts and undermining of Medicare. We all know how much that has been hurting in our communities. I am pleased to stand here to say that, in the community that I represent, we have been supported by this Albanese Labor government to support our local members accessing the health care that they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first thing I want to point out here, purely from a local perspective, is the reversing of the Liberal Party's local Medicare cuts. Unbeknownst to many, whilst in power in 2019 Scott Morrison's Liberal government made cuts that meant some regions of Australia, including Wyndham, were banned from hosting the overseas-trained doctors and doctors in the Bonded Medical Program that served our communities. This saw a depletion of GPs by 30 per cent in my community. That was 30 per cent fewer GPs on the ground. It saw cuts to long hours, where people could drop into the doctor on their way home from work. It saw cuts across the board. The Albanese Labor government has reversed that decision, and Wyndham is now part of the distribution priority area, recognising that shortage. Over time we'll build back that 30 per cent of GPs, and we'll be part of the process of training overseas-trained GPs. They told me, when I visited Utopia, one of our local GP clinics, recently, that it is already having the effect that we thought it would, and that they are able to have more GPs on their books. You can't get much better than that: as a member of a government, to go and visit a GP clinic and hear that good news that we have doctors coming back into our community, a community that needs access to general practitioners. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not just that. We've also tripled the bulk-billing incentive—the largest increase to the incentive in the 40-year history of Medicare. This will be supporting people in my community. We're also delivering the Medicare urgent care clinics across the country. There are many of these in Victoria, and I'm proud to say that there is one in Werribee. Having visited the Medicare urgent care clinic, I'm pleased to say that they are reporting that the community is becoming very aware of their existence, and rather than heading to emergency they are now able to be treated for non-life-threatening but very important things. On the ground, importantly, X-rays are available. Kids fall off the double bunk, kids have an accident at sport and break an arm with a greenstick fracture, and they can now go to that urgent care clinic and avoid long delays and avoid putting pressure on our hospital emergency. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also strengthening the Medicare GP grant. The Australian government is investing $220 million in grants over two years through the Strengthening Medicare GP Grants Program. I'm pleased to say that in 2023, 6,820 grants have been awarded Australia-wide. In Lalor, 41 of our GP clinics have collectively received over $1.1 million in funding in 2023. So we're supporting our GP practices. This government is about ensuring that they are supported so that we maintain the level of care that we already have to ensure people can access it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're increasing the bulk-billing payment incentives. This is important. From 1 November 2023 we're increasing Medicare Benefits Schedule bulk-billing incentive payments for Commonwealth concession card holders and children under 16 years of age for a range of MBS consultation items. This is an historic $3.5 billion investment across Australia and will triple the bulk-billing incentive. It's the largest-ever increase to the bulk-billing incentive in the history of Medicare and will provide an immediate benefit to 97,000 Australians in my community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Deputy Speaker, this government is serious about rebuilding Medicare, about fixing Medicare after 10 years of disaster under the previous government. I'm proud to stand here as the member for Lalor and speak on behalf of my community to say that they appreciate their government's actions. They need to see their doctors easily; they need access to good-quality health care; and this government's going to do it for them. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="281688" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr WEBSTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:58</span>):  This government is bold in claiming their health policies are improving outcomes for patients, because nothing could be further from the truth, notably in regional Australia. In fact, I want to take this opportunity to call out what seems like a severe case of absenteeism on the part of the health minister. I meet with healthcare providers, peak bodies, pharmaceutical companies every week. They tell me time and again that the minister simply refuses to meet with them. What is going on? They might get a meeting with an adviser, but seldom with the minister in person. I met with one of the medical colleges recently, and they told me that, of the 16 medical colleges in Australia, Minister Butler has so far only met with one of them. In their experience that is unprecedented. What health minister worth his salt won't even sit down and listen to the key organisations who contribute to policy in his portfolio? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What exactly has this government been doing on health for the last 16 months? I can tell you one thing they have done. They have jeopardised the viability of hundreds of pharmacies right across this country, especially regional pharmacies, with the 60-day dispensing policy. One regional pharmacist has done the calculations and told me he will suffer a net loss of $141,000 this financial year, despite the minister introducing a regional pharmacy transition allowance, which actually doesn't impact those in Modified Monash 3 to 7 in many cases. While the government modelling purports a $300 million annual saving for patients, it will actually result in a collective loss of $1.4 billion for pharmacies each year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You know what that means? It means we will see more regional pharmacies close or reduce their services because they cannot afford to pay their staff and their rent. That in turn puts more pressure on already beleaguered regional GPs and other health services. But does the government care? If their response to the advocacy of the pharmacy industry is anything to go by, then apparently not. True to form, they announced this policy without consulting the industry—shock—and have only been dragged to the negotiating table kicking and screaming after the fact. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I feel like a broken record repeating over and over again the catastrophic policies enacted under this health minister, but since they're wreaking such havoc, especially in regional areas, I'm compelled to do so. The same can be said of this government's policies on regional GP distribution. In what was nothing more than a cynical political move to appeal to metropolitan Labor voters, shockingly they expanded the priority areas to include, as we heard from the member for Lalor, MMM areas 2 and parts of 1. This has seen a 56 increased percentage of international medical graduate doctor going to urban centre clinics from regional areas where communities are crying out for them. So while the member for Lalor is shouting hallelujah, I'm saying this has been a terrible policy for regional Australians, on top of the data showing that upwards of 200 GP clinics have closed their doors over the past year. Yet the Labor government asks us to acknowledge they're making it easier for patients to see a doctor. I don't think so. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As for the urgent care clinics, where are they? They've opened nine in Victoria so far and not one of them is in my rural electorate of Mallee. My area covers over a third of the geographical space of Victoria, and there is not one. You might be okay in Melbourne, Shepparton or Ballarat, but if you're in Mildura or Horsham forget it. There's no help there. Of course if we ever do get one of their clinics in Mildura, they will just rebadge the existing primary care clinic, as they've done everywhere else. No extra services will be provided. That doesn't matter. No extra doctors will arrive. In fact, in the case of the state clinic in Mildura we haven't seen any material increase in health care services at all, because GPs and nurses have just been pulled from their current practices in to staff the new clinic. It's just a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul so that Labor can look good. But they don't, and regional people know it. There is nothing to celebrate about the performance of this government on health. Certainly not if you live in regional Australia. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="298121" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SITOU</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:02</span>):  I'm always happy to stand and speak in this House about the Albanese government's record when it comes to health care. We haven't been in government long, but when it comes to health care we've managed to get a lot of reform done. Of all the policy differences between us on this side of the House and those opposite, I think the biggest contrast can be seen in health care. The difference is stark between what we are already doing on this side of the House and the record left by the Leader of the Opposition during his time as health minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is tackling the bulk-billing challenge left by those opposite head on. We have allocated $3.5 billion to triple the Medicare bulk-billing incentive, helping over 11 million Australians to see a doctor without having to pay out-of-pocket costs. Bulk-billing incentive payments in metro areas will grow from $6.60 to $20.65 with indexation, and payments in the most remote areas of the country will go from $12.70 to $39.65. These are massive increases that will make a material difference to the ability of families and pensioners to see a GP. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is this investment so vital? It's about addressing the fundamental principle that health care should never be a privilege but should be a right for all Australians. It's about making sure that you rely on your Medicare card, not your credit card, when it comes to seeing a doctor. By making primary health care more affordable and accessible, we are reducing unnecessary emergency department presentations and hospital admissions, because we know that the cost to the taxpayer is far greater when someone has to go to the emergency department than when they are in a GP setting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is smart healthcare policy and smart fiscal policy, and it's exactly the sort of policy that was required after a decade of neglect under the Liberal Party—a decade of neglect of bulk-billing combined with $50 billion of cuts to our hospitals. There could never be a greater contrast between the record of this government and the record of the now Leader of the Opposition from when he was health minister. He oversaw freezes to the Medicare rebate, the crippling of bulk billing, GP taxes, and cuts to hospitals, so it's no surprise that the now Leader of the Opposition was crowned the worst health minister in 40 years by the AMA. So, while we have to acknowledge that we're coming from a very long way behind when it comes to rebuilding Medicare and our healthcare system, we are determined to get on with it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, I was thrilled that 60 GP clinics across Reid were awarded a combined $1.7 million in funding through the Albanese Labor government's Strengthening Medicare—General Practice Grants Program. These grants will allow participants to invest in innovation, training, equipment and capital works and will help GPs to improve the health of my community. And we're not stopping there, because we understand there's a lot more to do when it comes to making sure that more people can see a doctor without being charged a gap fee. Part of that is making sure that every part of our health system is working to its full scope of practice. That means doctors, pharmacists, nurses, midwives and allied health professionals—all of them—working to the limits of their professional capability so that we can get better outcomes for patients.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the Minister for Health and Aged Care for his work on the independent review being led by Professor Mark McCormack in this space. This is the hard work of government—the consultation, the listening—and this is the vision required to reform our health system so that it is fit for purpose in the 21st century. Frankly, this is the work that should have been done long ago, because there are few responsibilities a government has which are greater than ensuring that its people can get access to affordable health care.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VIOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:07</span>):  I'm very happy to rise and speak on this important motion about health. It's a big issue in my community, an outer suburban region of Melbourne. I had a look at the list of those speaking today. I've spoken quite a bit on these motions on health and I thought that the member for Macarthur, who is a doctor well respected across the aisle, would be speaking on this motion. Normally he would speak on a motion around health, but I noticed he wasn't on the list. I wasn't sure why until I happened to read the paper today and saw his quotes from the weekend criticising the government and their lack of action on health. I don't want to verbal the member, because I respect him greatly, so I'm going to quote exactly what he said: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We need to focus on people's quality of life and issues like housing and health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… there's been a deteriorating quality of life in the outer suburbs …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are direct quotes from the member for Macarthur, who is well respected by everyone in this House, about the lack of action and the lack of focus from this government on health, particularly in the outer suburbs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know those opposite will stand up and repeat the talking points that they have been given by the Minister for Health and Aged Care, and I understand that's what they want to do, but I commend the member for Macarthur for saying publicly what we all know many of those opposite are thinking. They know that this government has let down the Australian people when it comes to health, particularly in outer suburbs, like my electorate of Casey. Many people in my community know that they've been let down because, every time they try and get an extra doctor's appointment, they can't.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The facts also support the member for Macarthur's position that this government is failing when it comes to bulk-billing, because bulk-billing rates have dropped every single month since Labor came to government. The latest data reveals that bulk-billing rates are at their lowest since 2013, with residents out of pocket an average of $40.10 for every visit to the GP. Again, with this government, it's not what they say; look at what they do and what the facts are.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion talks about tax, which is interesting from a federal Victorian member. I know the member for Hawke will be up next. I'm looking forward to seeing whether he wants to criticise the new Premier, Jacinta Allan, and the state Labor government for their new payroll tax on independent GPs in Victoria. This new tax is estimated to increase the price of your visit to the GP by $40 to $60. That's a tax that the state Labor government are implementing in Victoria, including in my community, and there's not been a word from federal Labor criticising that tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what we know about this government. They have lots of spin but they won't deliver. They won't mention that they've cut 70 telehealth items from Medicare. Telehealth is crucial to an electorate like mine of Casey. It's 2,500 square kilometres with not one hospital and not one urgent care clinic either. There are no hospitals in this regional, rural, outer-suburban area and not one urgent care clinic. Now they're cutting 70 telehealth items which are crucial to people in my community up in Warburton, Woori Yallock and Healesville when they can't get to see the doctor. They won't talk about those cuts that they're making. Bulk-billing is down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When they talk about the urgent air clinics, they'll talk about how many they're implementing. In Victoria they'll talk about 10 new clinics. Again, the devil is in the detail. Eight of those 10 clinics already exist and were funded by the state government. They're literally moving the funding from state government to federal government with not one extra place delivered and not one extra GP for the communities that need them. It is all spin from this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The final cut that I want to talk about today is significant, and some of those opposite, including the member for Macnamara, have spoken out about this. They cut Medicare funded mental health visits from 20 to 10 at a time when there is a cost-of-living crisis and the report stated that those 20 sessions should continue. This government will spin, but it continues to cut, cut, cut. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech" style="font-weight:bold;">):</span>  The Albanese Labor government has wasted no time in getting Medicare back on track after a decade of cuts and neglect under the Liberals. Over their nearly 10 years in government, the Liberals destroyed the equitable access that was once the pride of our public healthcare system. They showed utter contempt for Medicare and the Australians who need it most. Slowly but surely the Liberals sought to systematically disassemble our public healthcare system and lock more and more people out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The contrast between the Liberals and Labor on health care could not be starker. As then Liberal health minister, Peter Dutton tried to introduce a GP tax on working Australians every time they needed to see a doctor. The Liberals wanted to make it harder and more expensive for people to visit the doctor and get the health care they need. When Labor managed to block the changes, the Liberals simply froze the Medicare rebate for six long years and ripped billions of dollars out of general practice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, the Albanese Labor government is tripling the bulk-billing incentive and making it easier for millions of Australians to get the medical attention that they need. That includes the 83,000 people in my electorate of Hawke. Starting from 1 November, this $3.5 billion investment represents the largest increase to the incentive in history. I know it will make a huge difference to my community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People will also have access to higher quality care at their local clinics thanks to the federal government's Strengthening Medicare—General Practice Grants Program. I was delighted to recently visit the Grant Street Medical Centre in Bacchus Marsh. It's one of 28 clinics in my electorate to receive funding from the Labor government that will enhance digital health capability, upgrade infection prevention and control and help achieve and maintain accreditation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Liberals were in government and the opposition leader was the health minister, they also cut $50 billion from our public hospitals, causing more crowding and longer wait times. Meanwhile, the Albanese Labor government is establishing 58 Medicare urgent-care clinics across the country to ease the pressure on busy emergency departments and reduce wait times for patients. These urgent-care clinics provide care for serious but non-life-threatening injuries and illnesses and are open from 8 am until 10 pm every single day. The Sunbury urgent-care clinic in our community has already seen thousands of patients receive the urgent care they need without waiting for an appointment or visiting an emergency department. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals didn't just make it harder to see a doctor; they also tried to make medicines more expensive by cutting $1.3 billion from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and forcing patients to pay $5 more for every single script. The Albanese Labor government is doing the exact opposite. We've already made medicines cheaper by reducing the general co-payment by $12.50 per script and are further reducing the cost by introducing 60-day dispensing for certain medications, which started in September and is rolling out over the coming months. Although this reform was recommended by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, an independent committee, back in 2018, the former Liberal government chose never to implement it, and this cost Australians billions of dollars. Now, thanks to the Albanese Labor government, patients whose medicine is available for 60-day dispensing will save $180 a year on each of those medicines, easing the significant financial burden that so many people with chronic health conditions face.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor built Medicare, which started almost 40 years ago under the Hawke government. Since then, the Liberals have sought to erode and undermine the system at every single opportunity. Now, led by a man once voted 'the worst health minister in 40 years' by the AMA—those left-wing bastions!—the Liberals are desperately attempting to undermine the measures that are successfully cleaning up their mess. Only Labor governments, like this one, can be trusted to deliver the changes and reforms required to ensure that Australians can affordably and more easily access the health care they need. We're investing in primary health, we're taking pressure off our hospitals and we're making it easier and cheaper to get the treatment and medicines that people in our communities need. </span>

This motion was moved by a member whose electorate is in New South Wales, I think. So, regrettably, if you're a South Australian you'd be quite humiliated and embarrassed to be serving in a government that, according to this motion, has established bulk billing Medicare urgent-care clinics across the country. Well, I wasn't aware of this; I didn't think any had been established in South Australia. I assumed that I was wrong, so I checked. I went on the website and typed in 'South Australia' in the search function, and it said that no results matched. That's because no urgent-care clinics have been opened in my home state of South Australia, despite the promise that by 1 July 2023 these 58 Medicare urgent-care clinics across the nation would all be open. Now, I believe it is October; I believe it is four months past—</span>

Barry's passing marks the end of an era, leaving an irreplaceable void in the hearts of his family and the wider Ormeau community that he has been involved in for so long. 'Lion' McGrath, as he was more fondly known, was a lifelong member of Lions Clubs International and a founding pillar of the local Ormeau Lions Club, which he helped form with his wife, Mary. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">A recipient of the Melvin Jones Fellowship award, Barry worked tirelessly to make Ormeau a better place to live, with an incredible devotion to community service. Through his over 30 years of service, Barry undertook so many positive projects in our community. This included the management of the only Driver Reviver site on the Gold Coast, which Barry built and ran with the help of Mary for many years, ensuring weary travellers were well rested, significantly improving the safety on our roads. </span>

My thoughts and condolences go out to Barry's wife, Mary; his family; the Ormeau Lions Club; and all those lives he touched. Barry, you will be deeply missed. May you rest in peace. </span>

First of those is Nicole Brown. On Saturday morning I went down to catch up with her because she had coordinated the Barca Academy camps. Honourable members might've heard of the Barcelona football club. With the help of some local businesspeople, the Halikos and Briceno-Rossi families, Nicole Brown, as a Larrakia community leader, bought those Spanish soccer players over to Darwin, and they did a great morning with the kids. Young First Nations kids were running around playing a bit of soccer. Obviously, they are a massive professional sporting club, and it's great to see them getting out and doing some training with some of those kids. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  While campaigning for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice, I had the great privilege to speak alongside a Bondi Indigenous leader, Gene Ross. Something he said stuck with me: 'We have 65,000 years of the longest continuous culture and 235 years of European settlement. That isn't 65,000 years or 235 years. It is not about one or the other. It's about recognising the sum of these times: 65,000 plus 235.' Gene's generosity is typical of the Aboriginal leaders I worked with over the campaign. I am heartbroken for them, for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and for the tens of thousands of 'yes' volunteers, including 800 in Wentworth. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The referendum arose out of a request from Indigenous people to be recognised in the Constitution through the Voice. They didn't ask for symbolic recognition; they wanted a recognition that would make a practical difference in their lives. I'm proud that Wentworth answered that call and tried to deliver that recognition. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have three reflections from the weekend. Firstly, what an honour it has been to work alongside Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people on this campaign. Secondly, it is clear that Australia desperately needs to improve how we conduct elections and referendums so Australians can rely on truth from the media and from their leaders. Finally, the goal of the Voice, to make a practical difference to the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, is more important than ever. With or without the Voice, closing the gap is a massive challenge. This task is now all of ours to accomplish. We cannot continue to fail. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:04</span>):  My electorate of Holt is home to many older Australians from India. While some of them are empty-nesters, many periodically move between India and Australia to be with their children and grandchildren. They often face social isolation here, especially during the daytime, when their children are at work and their grandchildren are at school. Compassionate Hands plays a crucial role in supporting Indian-origin seniors from across my electorate and combating isolation among this cohort. Through the combination of social, cultural and educational activities, including tours to locations of historically and ecological importance, sessions on e-safety and celebrations of Hindu and Sikh festivals, the senior group ensures their members are engaged and active. They also organise regular catch-ups in parks and community centres across my electorate to promote conversation and friendship. I was pleased to attend their Diwali and Bandi Chhor Divas celebrations recently. The festivities included music performances, amazing Indian chaat and light dancing with all the aunties. I want to commend their executive, particularly the president, Jagdeep Singh Sukhija, for their excellent work, and I look forward to visiting them again in the near future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  If you look out the window on the train to Ormond, you might spy the charming Glen Orme Tennis Club tucked away under the gum trees in the small street by the railway line. My thanks go to its president, Tom Quinn, who invited me to help launch Glen Orme's Try Tennis program on Saturday 16 September. Try Tennis offers four free tennis lessons to first-timers in Goldstein. Held during the day through the week and on Saturdays, the club is particularly seeking to give access to stay-at-home or single parents, people from non-tennis cultures and shiftworkers like paramedics and nurses in our community. The program is also targeted at Goldstein's culturally and linguistically diverse community groups, including many represented as parents of children in their existing coaching program.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Glen Orme community tennis club has operated for over 60 years, supporting junior tennis, pennant tennis, tennis coaching, social tennis and casual tennis. With evidence showing ever-increasing loneliness and isolation for many in our society, I commend Tom and everyone at Glen Orme Tennis Club for their efforts to look after and engage with the wider community and for thinking outside the square to provide a program welcoming those not from a traditional tennis-playing background. I wish them the very best and much success with their Try Tennis program and community club.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:07</span>):  On the long weekend, the mighty mountain men the Penrith Panthers did what many believed couldn't be done. They won their third straight NRL grand final. They didn't just repeat their success; they did the three-peat and proved themselves to be the undisputed champions of the game. It'll go down in history as one of the greatest games of rugby league, with the Panthers coming back from a 16-point deficit to defeat the Brisbane Broncos 26 to 24. Congratulations to co-captains Nathan Cleary and Isaah Yeo and the entire club for this incredible achievement.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to single out one player, Mitch Kenny, for his role in the victory, scoring the opening points in the game—his first try of the season. A favourite of many Panthers fans, Mitch was raised in the Hawkesbury in my electorate and played junior footy with the Windsor Wolves before signing with Penrith in a deal that saw him work as a greenkeeper for the club. His hard work, consistency and passion for the game has taken him from mowing the footy fields to winning grand finals on them. Only recently I presented awards at the junior players celebration for the Windsor Wolves, and I loved seeing their young faces and their excitement about the game: boys and girls celebrating their achievements. Thank you, Wolves, for your part in developing not just the stars that Penrith have now but also the stars of the future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:09</span>):  Today I want to acknowledge a sandstone milestone. It's the centenary of that great local business Gosford Quarries. In some ways, every Australian knows the work of Gosford Quarries. The sandstone extracted from those quarries adorns everything from the local ANZAC RSL memorial at Glenorie to the Sydney Town Hall, St Mary's Cathedral and the Australian War Memorial here in Canberra. In our cities and suburbs, Australian sandstone reflects something of the timeless majesty of our land. So it's fitting that a business such as Gosford Quarries has also lived through time and is the largest sandstone quarry and supplier in Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ownership of Gosford Quarries has evolved over time, and today it's a family business. Sarkis Bros was established in Sydney in 1993 by brothers George, John, Issa and Kozhaya. They followed their father Antonio's success. Antonio founded a limestone quarry in Lebanon in the 1970s. Alongside the brothers are their wonderful spouses, who all play a role: Rita, Nadine, Olivia and Antoinette. Antoinette gave an absolutely magnificent speech at the centenary. The Sarkis family don't call themselves 'owners'; they call themselves 'business custodians'. They treat their customers as partners. It's been said some of their sandstone work for the War Memorial was a follow-up after service work done for the memorial in the 1940s. What a wonderful ethos. The Sarkis family are a testament to Australia's great multicultural character. They pride themselves on their community participation and through their decisions they live out their deep faith. I congratulate the custodians and staff of Gosforth quarry and the Sarkis family on this remarkable milestone.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:10</span>):  I have the delight of living in one of the most beautiful areas in the country, the New South Wales South Coast. Not only is it a beautiful place to live; it is also full of wonderful events and festivals. Today I want to talk about two amazing events that happened on the South Coast just this weekend. There was the always fantastic South Coast Food and Wine Festival. This festival is an incredible showcase of what the South Coast has to offer. It is a wonderful way to spend a weekend—sampling some of the fine wine and food that the region has to offer, with local entertainment, all at the beautiful Moona Moona Creek Reserve in Huskisson. There were many wonderful brewers, distillers and producers with their wares on offer this weekend, including Silos Estate, Cambewarra Estate, Two Figs Winery, Jervis Bay Brewing Co, Tara Distillery, Cupitt's Estate and many, many more. If you haven't been to the South Coast Food and Wine Festival, mark it in your calendar for next year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also on over the weekend was the Berry Gardens Festival. This wonderful event showcases gardens in Berry and the surrounding areas that are selected for their design, plant variety and creativity. You will see all manner of things every year, from small cottage gardens to sweeping rural landscapes, but every year there's something new.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The South Coast Food and Wine Festival and the Berry Gardens Festival are just two of the amazing festivals the South Coast has to offer. I would like to thank all the partners, producers, stallholders, sponsors, gardeners, residents, organisers and volunteers for making these festivals happen.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  I am proud to share the story of World War I Brunswick Junction war veteran Bill Arthur, who will be honoured for his military service later this month. The commemoration will be held at the Old Harvey Cemetery, where Bill's unmarked grave will be upgraded to Commonwealth war grave status. Trooper Arthur sat with the 10th Light Horse Regiment after he enlisted in Perth in October 1915. The then 44-year-old joined the 13th reinforcement of the 10th Light Horse Regiment, heading to Egypt in January 1916. He served in several other units before being discharged in 1919.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bill moved to Brunswick after he was allocated property as part of the soldier settlement scheme. He lived in a small home near the Brunswick River on Wellesley Road and would take his daily bath near the Wellesley bridge. Bill was made a life member of the Brunswick RSL in 1940 and passed away in 1942 but was buried in an unmarked grave in the Old Harvey cemetery. In recognition of his ties to the area, the Australind and Districts Historical Society renamed the Brunswick River crossing on Wellesley Road 'Bill Arthur's Bridge' in 2015 and it is listed on the heritage council's places database. I want to congratulate and thank the organiser of this, Brian Bevans, from the Brunswick 10th Light Horse Harvey Troop, who will see this grave recognised.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:13</span>):  A couple of weeks ago I was invited to the very active Marino and Kingston Park Neighbourhood Watch AGM by the president Darren Bailhache. We had speakers from the RSPCA speak about their role in animal rescues and in animal protection, and then we heard from Senior Constable Matt Robinson from Sturt Police Station on the topic of scams. We heard about a wide range of scams, largely of the online and phone variety—romance scams, investment and cryptocurrency scams, gift card scams, parcel delivery scams, bill payment scams and nude photo blackmail scams—and, most concerningly, that some scammers can now use technology that masks the number they are calling from. Instead, it looks like they are calling from a known number, a number you trust.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The take-home message we had from this was: if you get a text message, don't click on the link. Your bank or utility company will not address you as 'dear sir', 'dear madam', 'dear homeowner' or 'dear business'. They know who you are. You can mouse over links without clicking and see where they really go. When in doubt, hang up, don't answer the text message, look up the contact details separately and call them or email back. The inconvenience of going through the main switchboard or call centre is much better than losing money. An active Neighbourhood Watch can reduce local crime by as much as 28 per cent, and I'd encourage people to get involved in their local Neighbourhood Watch.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:15</span>):  It is again that time of year when those who live in a bushfire-prone area need to start paying serious attention to making sure they have a plan in the event of the worst occurring and a fire potentially threatening them, their family and their property. I have many parts of my electorate that are in bushfire-prone areas, and I urge not only my constituents but also people across the country who live in a bushfire-prone area to think very seriously that you have a plan if the unthinkable occurs. We know we can't ever predict the ignition of a bushfire, but just as importantly we also can't predict how quickly they can move and change course and so it's vital that everyone knows what they would do if the unthinkable occurs and they hear the news that their home, their property or where they happen to be is at risk of being subject to a bushfire threat.</span>

They also provide excellent warnings as early as possible, and there is lots of technology available now that makes it even quicker and clearer as to when and how they communicate threats. Please, everyone who needs to, have a bushfire action plan, have a plan to get away from danger as quickly and as safely as you can as we enter fire season across the country.</span>

The Ingham institute is a unique facility in south-west Sydney which has aligned its research with the clinical needs of the local area health district. Research done by the institute immediately makes a difference to the lives of people in our community. The model is unique in New South Wales and Australia, and perhaps the world.</span>

Researchers have published 728 papers this year in prestigious journals like <span style="font-style:italic;">The Lancet</span> and has published over 2,000 papers in the last five years. A mountain of work for the just over 300 researchers that call the Ingham home.</span>

On the night, the institute also launched their strategic plan for 2023-2026. The mission of the institute is summed up by 'Local purpose, national significance and global impact'. I thank Stephen Thompson, the CEO, Terry Goldacre, the chair, and Professor Les Bokey AM, research director, for the warm hospitality and, more importantly, for the work they do to find solutions for our community.</span>

What we're seeing from states and territories is them hiding data that shows the conditions of roads right across our country. To get access to this data, I was forced to use freedom of information against the Victorian state government to find out the conditions of the roads in Wannon. And what that freedom of information request showed was that we need immediate investment in our roads.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Automobile Association have a campaign going calling for every state and territory government to release this data now. The road toll is going up and we need data driven investment in our roads. I call on every member of the House to get behind this call for state and territory governments to release the data around the conditions on our roads. And not only that, but I also call on the federal government to honour the election commitment that they made. They said they would ask all states and territories to release this data before allocating the billions of dollars they give them when it comes to road funding. We need more transparency to save lives on our road and I call on everyone to back this campaign.</span>

Ladies Like to Lunch is a non-profit organisation that works in my community to provide support to people with cancer. Their goal is to empower women particularly as they embark on their difficult journey with cancer and to build a strong support network for them and their families. Cancer is a battle that half of all Australians will be affected by, either directly or indirectly, and this journey is something that no-one should face alone.</span>

The centre provides support through gardening, art workshops, wig services, massages, meditation and many other things. Ladies Like to Lunch provides care packages to those with cancer to help them on their journey. These packages are designed to make the people who are receiving them feel special. This year they have a pink ribbon event, like they did last year, and it will be held on Sunday 29 October. There are some seats left, but very few, so, if you would like to come, please make sure that you get in contact really soon. Last year they raised over $35,000 with this event, and I look forward to helping them raise even more.</span>

Today, we have four, and that is thanks to the tremendous efforts of Gai Hawthorn of the Penrith CBD Corporation, as well as the generous people across our community in small business and even community members who have just given so much. We have raised over $300,000, I believe, and $50,000 this year alone, which means that we'll get another breast care nurse very soon. Breast care nurses support not only women with breast cancer but their families as well.</span>

She has supported, through the McGrath Foundation, our Pink Up Penrith events over the last few years. It has been a wonderful community event. Small businesses are doing their part by both lighting Penrith pink and also giving so generously. I'd like to congratulate everyone involved. Raising around $300,000 is a great effort. I believe we just have to beat Mudgee now. They're fantastic results, and I give my love to everyone suffering from breast cancer in my community.</span>

This should be a source of pride for all Australians. While Australia was not ready to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders through a voice to parliament, Indigenous disadvantage has been put on a national stage, and I believe that all Australians believe that Indigenous disadvantage is unacceptable. We now must find a different path forward to closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. I remain committed to fighting for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, and I will walk beside them. I respect the decision of the Australian people.</span>

This includes almost 300 'yes' volunteers in Swan, who knocked on nearly 10,000 doors and made thousands of phone calls. Thank you for your commitment to progress. To the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders in my community, I say that I'm sorry. Your strength, courage and grace are a source of inspiration. Please know that I will be beside you. I also respect that Indigenous leaders have called for a week of silence to mourn the results. Australia is the land of a fair go, where everyone can reach their full potential, and it is now time for us to reflect on how we create a better future for all Australians, including First Nations Australians.</span>

I cannot express enough the importance of recognising the contributions of our service men and women, as well as acknowledging the equipment and facilities that they use. HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Magnetic </span>is one of those facilities, a naval depot that was erected along Townsville's coastline. Established in 1942, its purpose was to assist with the allied war effort, and that year was certainly right in the crux of World War II. A presence like HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Magnetic </span>was vital to ensure our defence capability on land and at sea.</span>

This program was to recognise HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Magnetic</span> with a plaque at our Anzac Park, and it was a no-brainer. This commemoration clearly achieves the intended outcomes of this grant. This facility certainly contributed to the building foundations of what we see in Townsville as the largest garrison city in the nation. It was a true honour to be involved in providing HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Magnetic</span> its permanent place at its rightful home in Anzac Park.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:25</span>):  The Mid-Autumn Festival is a significant time in the lunar calendar and is very important in my community in Chisholm. I was privileged to attend many Moon Festival celebrations in my community, with events held right across the electorate. There were delicious mooncakes, brilliant creative performances and time spent celebrating together and enjoying each other's company. I want to thank all the fantastic community groups that invited me to their Mid-Autumn Festival celebrations: the Asian Business Association of Whitehorse, the Melbourne Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Student Association of Monash, Chinese Oriental Martial Arts Inc, the Chinese Professionals Club of Australia, and the Melbourne Spring Arts Multicultural Seniors Association. These events were held right across the electorate, in Chadstone, Mulgrave, Glen Waverley, Mount Waverley and Box Hill. I want to thank everyone for their hospitality and their kindness. Congratulations to everyone for putting on such incredible Moon Festival celebrations. Happy Moon Festival—Zhong qiu kuai le!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:26</span>):  On Saturday our country had an opportunity to take another step towards reconciliation, but the nation indicated that it was not yet ready to do so. This time is a particularly difficult one for Indigenous Australians in our community and around the country. We have to recognise, acknowledge and respect their hurt and their disappointment.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But while our country voted against the Voice, Kooyong voted strongly in favour of it. Our rejection of cynical politics in favour of a more generous and inclusive Australia was reflected in the more than 700 incredible volunteers who dedicated hundreds of hours to achieving this result. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank them in this chamber. Thank you to everyone who knocked on a door, letterboxed their neighbourhood, helped out at prepoll, worked on a polling booth or hosted a corflute. You put your heart and soul into something in which we all truly believed, and you embodied the community spirit of Kooyong—so much so that today a 'no' campaign volunteer emailed my office to share his appreciation at the kindness and respect that our volunteers showed on Saturday. He said: 'Contrary to my concerns, everyone I met throughout the day was a pleasure to stand beside and to speak with, regardless of our differing views. There was no animosity or unpleasantness. It was a credit to the Kooyong campaign.' That's Kooyong. That's our community. Thank you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:28</span>):  Today I want to emphasise the critical importance of the Queenscliff Coast Guard and the heroic role they play in safeguarding our coastal waters. This emergency crew was recently involved in a dangerous rescue after a boat smashed into a reef near the Point Lonsdale Lighthouse. The sea pilot boat ran aground on its way through the treacherous waters of a rip, a four-metre swell and 60-kilometre-per-hour wind gusts. Water police confirmed that the three-man crew whose job it is to guide the ship safely through the heads had faced grave danger and were lucky to survive, while the 17-metre pilot boat was torn apart in the violent surf.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only the week before, I had joined the Queenscliff Coast Guard to celebrate their purchase of state-of-the-art wet weather gear, funded through our Stronger Communities Program. This Australian government grant was a lifeline to the Queenscliff rescue team, ensuring that they had the equipment to do their job effectively and return safely to their families. The Albanese government is dedicated to helping those who tirelessly protect our shores and our people, often facing the harshest of conditions. Emergency workers often go unrecognised, so I take this opportunity to thank the Queenscliff Coast Guard volunteers for protecting us when we need it most. Thank you. </span>

On a mission to increasing employment opportunities for people with disabilities, Makeables is a not-for-profit disability employer affiliated with the Multicap organisation. Currently, they have 80 supported employees at their workplace, with an additional 30 to 40 students attending each week from local special schools to gain skills and work experience. Makeables' goal is to help as many of their employees as possible to transition into open employment.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Conducting a variety of tasks to help in the assembly, packing and finishing of production and distribution, employees are offering tangible benefits to local businesses in our community. One such example of this is employees from Makeables helping to pack between 20 and 30 pallets a day of potato chips PepsiCo. Working at Makeables is also helping improve everyday life skills of people with disabilities, such as communication, problem-solving and working in a team, further allowing them to boost their confidence and thrive. I am happy to say Multicap and Makeables recently received a Stronger Communities grant, which they used to implement six custom-height adjustable workstations for their employees. During a recent visit, I had the pleasure of speaking with Nick, the employment operations manager at Multicap, and it was heartening to learn from Nick that the Stronger Communities grant— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Last night I was privileged to attend Dashain Night in Canberra to mark the beginning of this weeklong festival. Dashain is an annual festival celebrating the victory of the goddess Durga over the demon Mahisasur, of good over evil. Celebrated by Hindu people in other South-Asian countries, it is of particular importance to Nepalese Hindus.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I joined the Canberra Nepalese community for their Dashain celebrations down the road from this house at Albert Hall. I was joined by the Nepalese Ambassador to Australia and New Zealand, my good friend His Excellency Kailash Raj Pokarel, and his wife, as well as leaders from the community and from the ACT Legislative Assembly. All who attended were treated to brilliant music and art from members of the community and a taste of delicious Nepalese food provided by the team from Lakeside Gurkhas in Kingston. It was a reminder of the vibrant diversity of multicultural Australia and a reminder of our role to ensure that good prevails over evil. Dashain is one of the most important annual events in the Nepalese community, and I wish all the best to those who will be celebrating it over the next week right across this country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:32</span>):  I rise as a softball and baseball tragic to speak about one of the greatest sporting clubs in my electorate, that of St Pats Baseball Club. Sport brings our community together and provides essential physical and mental health benefits. My electorate plays a lot of sport, and that includes a lot of baseball. I was delighted that St Pats was recently a successful recipient of the 2023 Hughes electorate volunteers grant. I recently went out to the St Pats game against Illawong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">St Pats was formed in 1966. It is a volunteer-driven organisation, standing as a symbol of local community engagement and participation, teamwork, and all of the best that sport has to offer. The volunteer grant that St Pats Baseball Club obtained has enabled the club to enhance its facilities. This has included sunshades, groundskeeping equipment and professional development of its volunteers through coaching courses. This has created a far more enriching experience for the baseballers, both young and old, within my electorate and within St Pats Baseball Club. I had the privilege of making the first ceremonial pitch during the season-opening game between St Pats and the Illawong Marlins. Congratulations to St Pats Baseball Club and all of the volunteers associated with them. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:34</span>):  I rise today to mark the passing of Scott Bowden, 62, who died on 12 September. Scott—or Scotty, as he was well known—was a longtime councillor in the Central Highlands in my electorate, very well known and highly respected. Popular and gentle, he was a longtime farmer with a multigenerational history of both council service and farming in the district. He's extremely well known. I note that Mayor Lou Triffitt told me that it's been a tough time for the community since Scotty's passing.</span>

Police, naval cadets, ambulance and fire volunteers provided the guard of honour to mark all who've died in Tasmanian waters.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:35</span>):  Volunteering is something that is sadly in decline in our society. It needs to be encouraged so it does not become a thing of the past. In my travels throughout Mallee recently, I had the pleasure of meeting dedicated volunteers Bernice Murray, Jan Donnan and Keren Smith in Swan Hill. These lovely ladies are some of our highly valuable volunteers whose joy it is to go into nursing homes and sing. Their voices not only lift the spirits of those in the homes but also help connect patients who suffer with dementia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Their passion for volunteering, however, is facing barriers. They spoke to me about the red tape and costs that prevent them continuing to visit nursing homes—in particular, the new NDIS screening volunteer application pack that has replaced the usual working with children check and police check documentation. It takes a tedious length of time to attain it, it's expensive, and meanwhile it's the nursing home residents who miss out. This is ridiculous, and it is not the fault of the nursing homes. It is incumbent on the government to simplify this and make this process cheaper, because they can and because it's the right thing to do. Otherwise, volunteers such as Bernice, Jan and Keren will just have to walk away.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:37</span>):  It was an honour to be invited to speak at a ceremony last week in my electorate of Spence. The ceremony was part of the unveiling and naming of a new facility at the James Martin Village, which is owned by Gawler Community Retirement Homes, who run many facilities within the local area. Many facilities are named after those who had a hand in the Gawler area and what it is today—famous identities from Governor Gawler himself to James Martin, who served in both chambers of the colonial state parliament and as the local mayor a number of times. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We thought that it would be appropriate to find a suitable person to name this new facility after. There was one candidate who was an extremely obvious contender for this honour, a living legend, the Hon. Dr Bruce Eastick, AM. Serving as chairman of the Gawler Community Retirement Homes from 1969 to 2018, Dr Eastick somehow also found time in his life to serve in state parliament, even becoming Speaker and Leader of the Opposition. He also served as the Mayor of Gawler a number of times. He is a man who learned the definition of 'give' but never bothered to learn the meaning of 'take'. I wish I could have been there, if not for ill health at the time. I'm glad Mayor Karen Redman also made the worthy suggestion during the ceremony to Dr Eastick. We are all glad he accepted. Well done, Bruce. You well and truly earned it, and I hope you have a fantastic 96th birthday next week too.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second visit took me to the Cungulla Men's Shed, which boasts over 30 members, an impressive number for a small coastal town. The shed hosts all the usual activities and doubles as a community hub. You'll often find the members busy organising special community events, which range from fundraisers to memorial days, such as Anzac Day. This year marks the 30th anniversary for men's sheds. This incredible milestone is testament to the volunteers who have built and continue to drive this movement forward in all of our communities. I've been a supporter of men's sheds for many years, and I will continue to support them for many more to come. Well done, men.</span>

We have witnessed a devastating loss of innocent lives on both sides. In the aftermath of the Hamas attack, 34 Novocastrians were among the thousands of Australians trapped in Israel, holed up in a hotel in Tel Aviv. Thankfully, the last members of the Newcastle group have now left Israel. It is a welcome relief for their families and friends back home, whom I have been in regular contact with. I want to acknowledge the West family, who worked day and night to ensure the group got out of the country safely.</span>

I know our Muslim and Jewish communities will be feeling the heavy toll of this war. I have reached out to the rabbi in the Newcastle synagogue and the two mosques in my electorate to extend my condolences and express our community's collective concern about the tragic loss of lives and the wellbeing of people in Israel and Gaza. Novocastrians stand alongside our Jewish and Muslim communities in Newcastle. We are united in our efforts to secure lasting peace. People of all faiths are praying for peace. It is my hope that the international community will work together to help this unbearable violence of war stop, and ensure a peaceful and just resolution for the good of all.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:41</span>):  Last week Peter Dutton gave the keynote address at the WA Pastoralists and Graziers Association's annual convention, reaffirming the coalition's unwavering support for the WA live export industry. Today, I update the House on the damage currently being done to WA farming families due to the Labor government's commitment to ban the live sheep export trade. An uncertain time frame around industry closure is causing a collapse in farmer confidence and plummeting sheep prices. Only last week, a Boyup Brook farmer advertised 600 breeding sheep to give away for free. Others talk of shooting animals that were worth hundreds of dollars 12 months ago but are now of no commercial value. With constrained slaughter capacity at abattoirs, farmers are desperate to destock to avoid feed shortages and an on-farm animal welfare crisis come summertime.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I repeatedly warned the PM and ministers of the grave consequences of their ideologically driven obsession to ban live sheep exports despite the irrefutable evidence of positive animal welfare outcomes and the need to maintain decades-old trade relationships with the Middle East. I believe the pending report from the independent panel on the phase-out of live sheep exports by sea will document the deep harm this government is inflicting on WA regional communities. I implore the PM to heed the serious concerns I hold for the more than 3,500 regional families dependent on the $143 million live sheep export industry.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:43</span>):  This Saturday, I'll be attending a dinner to celebrate the Queensland Country Women's Association in rural Esk in Somerset in my electorate. The dinner is one of many events celebrating 100 years of the CWA and their commitment to the Queensland community. While the Esk branch of the CWA is under the stewardship of Estelle Drynan, the West Moreton division has many CWA branches. The division is diligently organised by President Gay Barrett and Secretary Helen Johnston.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The CWA members have provided a helping hand for those in need. At CWA meetings, stories are shared over a cup of tea or coffee, a piece of cake or a homemade scone, and I suspect some members believe I turn up to the divisional AGM only for the amazing food. The CWA cooking classes and community meal assistance are legendary. The arts and craft programs are fantastic. Since 1990, the CWA has provided payments for Queensland women and families suffering from natural disasters or other crises. Locally, they provide emergency kits to people in need, in conjunction with Ipswich Hospital. Local CWA branches have provided care packs for victims fleeing domestic and family violence. It's disturbing to see so many women and children escaping with only the clothes on their backs. The CWA has made birthing kits for women in Papua New Guinea to create more hygienic labour environments. The CWA has remained a constant, staying relevant to modern times, and I congratulate them on 100 years of commitment to Queensland.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No-one, and certainly no constituent in my electorate of Mackellar, is in any doubt that we're living through a cost-of-living crisis. A full four percentage point rise in interest rates since May 2022, increasing electricity, gas, petrol and grocery bills, and higher prices for everything from travel to education are hurting individuals, families and small businesses alike. A record 1.5 million people, almost a third of all mortgage holders, are now considered at risk of mortgage stress. That's without even considering the people, particularly young people, who may have been able to get into the property market a few years ago when interest rates were low but now can't because of higher interest rates and higher costs of living. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no doubt that the cost of living is one of the very biggest issues facing Australia today. And there's no doubt it's a difficult problem for governments to solve, not just our government but governments all over the world. However, governments elsewhere are taking bold steps to tackle not only this cost of living issue, but also the greater existential crisis of our times: climate change. Tackling these issues at the same time can be done. It's clear that climate policy and policies that tackle cost-of-living pressures are inextricably linked. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our closest ally, the United States, last year introduced its Inflation Reduction Act, and it is changing the world in a positive way and at pace. The Inflation Reduction Act, amongst other things, is an investment by the US government into domestic energy production through the promotion of clean energy and the electrification of the nation using this clean energy. It is the largest piece of federal legislation ever to address climate change. The Inflation Reduction Act provides tax credits and incentives for things like electric vehicles, home energy efficiency upgrades, home energy supplier improvements and advanced manufacturing. Within less than a year of its operation, the success of the act is clear. $US370 billion of government rebates and incentives have mobilised an estimated $US1.2 trillion in additional private sector capital. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia can and must rise to the challenge thrown down by the US. In fact, it is not so much of a challenge as a once-in-a-generation game-changing opportunity—for renewables, industrial revolution here in Australia. To do nothing would be to lose talent, investment and innovation to the more favourable conditions established in the US. To do nothing would be to miss an opportunity to reduce the cost-of-living pressures facing millions of Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time for the Australian government to design a system of incentives and rebates to turbocharge the transition to a clean energy economy. Our response must be unique to Australia, of course, and play to our comparative advantages. That comparative advantage is incredible. Our wind, solar, critical minerals and energy transition metals are the envy of the world. Here is what we could start with: the production and export of green iron and steel, green alumina and aluminium; the processing and refinement of minerals and metals; advanced manufacturing of solar, wind and battery componentry, electrolysers and grid control technology; the electrification of heat pumps and home energy management systems; the acceleration of transmission infrastructure including cabling and towers; and investment in zero carbon transport—vehicles and fuels. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Climate and energy finance expert Tim Buckley quite rightly says that Australia's response to the US act should be commensurate to our opportunities, that our opportunities are limitless, and that we have the opportunity to change the world. Just three weeks ago Australia's Centre for Policy Development released a report entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">G</span><span style="font-style:italic;">reen Gold</span><span style="font-style:italic;">—</span><span style="font-style:italic;">a strategy to kickstart Australia's renewable industry future</span>. The report calls for the Australian government to respond more aggressively to the US Inflation Reduction Act by spending $100 billion for green aluminium and ammonia and onshore processing of iron ore over the next 10 years. What is incredible is that this could be paid for by simply ending federal subsidies for the fossil fuel industry, which currently sit close to $10 billion a year or $100 billion over 10 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An Australian IRA-style bill would not only help to decarbonise our economy but help create the highly paid clean energy jobs of the future and, importantly, help to reduce a huge cost-of-living pressure that Australians face. We must urgently rise to this challenge. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <a href="147140" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PHILLIPS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:50</span>):  Today I want to talk about one of the most pressing issues facing my community, the cost of living. It is no secret that household budgets are under pressure, but that's why addressing inflation and providing targeted and responsible cost-of-living relief is our No. 1 priority. Since being elected, we have rolled out substantial targeted cost-of-living relief measures, putting billions of dollars back into the pockets of Australians who need it most. It's all part of our 10-point plan to address the cost-of-living pressures in our economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's start with cheaper medicines. The Albanese Labor government have already helped people save thousands of dollars through our cheaper medicines policy. We have dropped the previous co-payment from $42.50 to $30. This measure alone has already saved local people in the Gilmore electorate over $772,000 in medicine costs on over 69,000 prescriptions. But it is not only that. As of last month, doctors are now able to prescribe 92 of the most common medications listed on the PBS for 60 days. This is twice the medication for the price of a single script. This will save patients up to $180 per eligible medicine a year. People will also save on unnecessary trips to the doctor. They will also save on fewer trips to the pharmacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, I announced the location for the Medicare urgent care clinic at Batemans Bay. The urgent care clinic will provide free care for urgent but non-life-threatening injuries. There will also be a Head to Health clinic opening in Moruya for adults and a new headspace opening in Kiama for young people aged 12 to 25. Both these clinics will provide free or low-cost mental health services, further helping with the cost of living. We have also provided more Medicare bulk-billing by tripling the bulk-billing incentive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Energy costs are a concern for many people in my community, which is why we supported and delivered a targeted energy rebate of $500 per eligible household. This means thousands of pensioners, families and carers will receive a one-off $500 payment towards their electricity bill. That is real, targeted relief for people's power bills which the coalition voted against. We introduced coal and gas price caps, further easing pressure on energy bills. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've increased the pay for aged-care workers. On 30 June this year aged-care workers were given a 15 per cent pay rise. For too long aged-care workers have been among the lowest paid workers in our economy, yet they have one of the most important jobs: looking after our elderly and vulnerable. This pay rise doesn't only reward them for the hard work they do; it also helps with the household budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not just aged-care workers, though. We are getting wages moving again. We have expanded Paid Parental Leave. We have also boosted income support payments. This includes raising the age pension, the veteran service pension, JobSeeker and youth allowance. That means thousands and thousands of people in my region have more money in their pockets for things families can't do without, such as groceries, fuel, energy and much more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have increased rent assistance and we have a huge agenda for building more affordable and social rental homes. Our cheaper childcare measures are providing relief on one of the biggest expenses families have, child care. When we launched the cheaper childcare subsidy, I met a local mother, Lisa, who told me that our changes to child care will mean she won't have to choose between being a mum and progressing her career as a healthcare professional on the South Coast. That's fantastic because it makes child care cheaper but also empowers parents to continue to work and support their community. Our fee-free TAFE and skills shortage measures are making a real difference while also providing cost-of-living relief.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are delivering real relief where it's needed most, targeting the cost-of-living pressures that are hitting our communities the hardest. Australia is not immune to the global factors which are causing inflationary challenges. But people can be reassured that our combination of budget restraint, the first budget surplus in 15 years, getting inflation under control and targeted cost-of-living relief is helping put more money back into people's pockets. Our No. 1 priority is addressing this inflation and cost-of-living challenge. That's why we have a 10-point plan to address the cost-of-living pressures in our economy, and I am working hard every single day to provide the cost-of-living relief our community deserves.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="286042" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SPENDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:54</span>):  It's no secret that people across the country are struggling with the cost of living. It's the biggest issue facing constituents in Wentworth, where each week I have a steady stream of constituents contacting me asking the government to do more. Outside of housing, energy bills are one of the biggest drivers of our current challenges, with the retail electricity tariffs rising by more than 20 per cent. These energy price rises have been driven by Australia's dependence on expensive and volatile fossil fuels, which spiked with the war in Ukraine. And while we're seeing some moderation as we get more cheaper renewables into the grid, the challenges facing families are acute.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government must take further action on household power bills, and we should be looking to our American counterparts for inspiration. It's now just over a year since President Biden signed the US Inflation Reduction Act. The IRA is the single biggest investment ever made in transitioning America's energy system from one based on expensive fossil fuels towards one based on cleaner, cheaper renewable energy. It's a landmark inflation-busting bill that has lowered costs for many American families, spurred domestic manufacturing and made historic investments in climate action. The US IRA includes $369 billion in energy and climate spending, which could nearly triple over the decade. The IRA has also played a critical role in stimulating large-scale renewables, advanced manufacturing and future industries such as hydrogen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the key to the US IRA was the focus placed on the demand side: where Americans use energy in their homes, vehicles and small businesses. Under the IRA, the average household in America qualifies for around $14,000 in incentives to electrify and lower their power bills. They get a 30 per cent rebate when they install more-efficient electrical appliances, like hot water heat pumps. They get a 30 per cent rebate when they buy rooftop solar or a household battery. And they get a 30 per cent rebate when they purchase a second-hand electric vehicle. These incentives are helping households to permanently reduce their power bills through cheaper renewables and improved home energy performance and, at the same time, make a difference to the planet. The impacts are clear to see. US inflation is down to 3.7 per cent, 272 new clean energy projects have been announced, and carbon emissions are projected to decline at twice the rate expected previously.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The US IRA is already delivering for the American economy and our climate. In our cost-of-living crisis, Australia needs its own inflation reduction act, not only because of our once-in-a-generation opportunity to lead the world in clean energy exports, critical minerals and advanced manufacturing but also because it is the best way to reduce household power bills right now. I welcome the government's commitment to developing an IRA response. We need to see this urgently, and households must be at the centre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has made welcome commitments in the budget, but the $1.3 billion commitment is just one-tenth of the incremental investment that Rewiring Australia estimated is needed to electrify every Australian home. If Australia was to match the scale of incentives under the US IRA, the investment required would be much higher. When we put households at the centre of an Australian IRA we must ensure that nobody is left behind—in particular, the one-third of Australians who rent. Renters make up 45 per cent of my electorate of Wentworth. But, despite recent government announcements, they remain locked out of the opportunity to permanently reduce their power bills through electrification. They're dependent on their landlord to make upgrades to their property, but landlords don't benefit from the lower power bills that come from switching out expensive gas for more-efficient electrical appliances.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why two weeks ago I joined my crossbench colleagues in presenting the government with a fully costed proposal that would turbocharge the installation of more than 10,000 additional hot water heat pumps, induction cooktops and energy-efficient home heating each year. When combined, they will reduce renters' power bills between $514 and $594 each year. Measures like these are essential to reducing household power bills and our carbon emission and must be included as part of Australia's response to the Inflation Reduction Act.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every time you buy illegal cigarettes you're supporting organised crime. When generally law-abiding smokers quit legal tobacco to purchase from the black market they believe the only victim is a greedy federal or state government missing out on $4.2 billion of tobacco excise and $400 million in GST, but illicit tobacco is often the cashflow arm for sophisticated criminal syndicates dealing in the worst of the black market, including human trafficking, sex slavery and drugs. When authorities seize illicit cigarettes they are often in the company of drugs including ice, crack and cocaine or illegal guns and stolen vehicles. Illicit tobacco translates to more powerful international Middle Eastern gangs and more grief on the streets. In April a Gympie shop selling illicit tobacco was firebombed. The fire spread and damaged neighbouring businesses. So far this year we've recorded at least 29 firebombings on tobacco shops and daylight gang shootings in our cities as criminal gangs are acting with, it appears, impunity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To better understand the nature of the illicit tobacco market the former coalition government held an inquiry through the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The ABF informed the committee that organised criminal networks involved in illicit tobacco operate similarly to those involved in the importation of other contraband … such as narcotics. These criminal organisations:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… they look … they behave … very similar to those … involved in the importation of drugs, and … may be one and the same.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Illicit tobacco is now a dangerous law-and-order issue in our country. At estimates in May 2023 Australian Border Force commissioner Michael Outram said on a good day they could detect only 20 per cent of the illegal drugs imported into the country. The ATO's tax gap webpage acknowledges the boom of illicit tobacco even as authorities seize the highest amounts ever recorded. This is not an overnight crisis; it has grown as continual excise increases have pushed smokers to the black market because they can no longer afford legal, regulated tobacco products.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week, a tobacco bill before the parliament will ban certain tobacco products from legal retailers altogether, making them exclusive to the black market. This legislation is more of the same. It will put graphic warnings on individual legal cigarettes, ban legal menthols and limit advertising of legal vapes, all while the illegal trade flourishes and sells to underage children and teens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the Albanese government believes that health warnings on individual cigarettes will lower smoking rates, then why isn't the government addressing contraband tobacco? Without investment in policing at the Australian border and at the retail level, this legislation and further excise increases will supercharge the illicit tobacco market, making it the dominant supplier of tobacco products in Australia. Illicit tobacco consumption is going gangbusters, with 2.6 million kilograms smoked a year, worth about $4.2 billion. One in four cigarettes can now be linked to organised crime. On the current trend, criminal gangs will run 40 per cent of the Australian tobacco market by the next election, when two in five smokes will be untaxed and sold in non-compliant packaging. Legal domestic sales volumes have fallen from 14.3 million kilograms in 2012 to 8.5 million kilograms in 2022, yet smoking rates are not plummeting in the same way.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ANANDA-RAJAH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:11</span>):  Nicotine is a highly addictive substance—in fact, it is a drug—and I've seen the effects of nicotine addiction up close and personal in my medical practice. It results in accelerated atherosclerosis, which pretty much affects every single blood vessel in your body, large, small or even microscopic. The effects include stroke, heart attack and peripheral vascular disease, which itself leads to serial amputations. It often starts with a small digit, maybe a toe, and then what happens is usually what we describe in the medical profession—informally—as salami surgery. The toe would go, then you would end up with a below-knee amputation, and so on and so forth, with multiple debridements in between. The problem with nicotine addiction is that it is a threat multiplier. In combination with diabetes, it is a very, very potent amplifier of accelerated atherosclerosis and inflammation, and the effects are disastrous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a government, we are taking this problem very seriously in an attempt to disrupt tobacco networks and the sale of illicit tobacco, as well as vapes, in order to build upon a proud Labor tradition of reducing smoking rates in this country. We know that tobacco is a leading cause of preventable disease burden in Australia, accounting for 8.6 per cent of the total burden of disease back in 2018. The numbers of daily smokers aged 14 years and above in 2019 were 12 per cent in men and nearly 10 per cent in women. But there are some bright spots. There has been a decline in active smokers over 20 or so years. We also know there has been an increase in the proportion of adults who never take up smoking. In 1991, that number was 49 per cent. In 2019, that number is now 63 per cent. These data come from the AIHW. As of 2017, 82 per cent of secondary school students had never tried smoking, compared to 77 per cent in 2011.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we have to remain vigilant. Why? Because we have seen the scourge and ingress of vapes into a much younger generation—children. These things are disguised as anything but cigarettes. They look like batteries, like highlighter pens. They have enticing colours and even more enticing names and, obviously, a range of flavours. The Albanese government is intent on banning these items, because they are ever-prevalent and they are popping up like weeds. We do know that in 2019 almost two in five current smokers aged 14 or over have used e-cigarettes. These were originally sold as being a means to cease smoking, to break the habit, but what has happened is they have become gateway drugs, leading to greater levels of nicotine addiction in people in later in life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to the illicit trade of tobacco, this is a significant problem and it is underpinned by sophisticated criminal syndicates. Organised crime networks are increasingly resorting to acts of violence, including arson, threats and result—and why? Because the amount of money involved in this trade is huge. Last year, Border Force made over 120,000 detections of illicit tobacco, seizing over 1.8 billion cigarettes and over 867 tonnes of looseleaf tobacco. This tobacco is grown in regional areas, often in communities that know it is happening, and it takes a great deal of collaboration and intelligence on the ground and in collaboration both interstate and with the Commonwealth to disrupt these networks. For example, between April and May this year, the taskforce looking into this in combination with the ATO and NSW police, raided three illegal tobacco plantations across New South Wales. This activity resulted in the seizure of more than 264 tonnes of illicit tobacco. Similarly, in August this year, there was another sophisticated operation to disrupt a group in South-East Queensland and northern New South Wales, involving the AFP, New South Wales and Queensland police, and the TGA.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In order for this sort of work to continue, we have to maintain good relationships with our state counterparts and ensure we get multijurisdictional collaboration.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:17</span>):  When the member for Wide Bay asked if I would second this motion and showed it to me, I was more than happy to do that for a few reasons. One is I have high regard for him as a person of integrity both in this place and as someone who wore a police uniform. He put his own safety on the line and knows a lot about this area, and sophisticated and unsophisticated criminal networks. I was also happy to support this because, like all of us, there are moments in our lives, especially when we are younger when we experience the first death of a loved one. For me, that was my grandmother, who died in her early 60s from smoking-related illnesses. I saw that the heartbreak on my family when she was robbed of another 20 years of life. In the late 1980s, that was quite common—a lot of people had relatives who lost decades of their lives because of the harm of smoking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things we see in many different areas of public policy is well-intended legislation that has unintended consequences. This is certainly one of those. It is easy to think that taxes and advertising will solve every problem. If that were the case, we wouldn't have many problems here to solve, because we're very good at taxing things here and there is a lot of money to run advertising campaigns. They are effective to a point, but when we squeeze too much on one side of an equation and ignore the other, we are not solving the problem—we're just making ourselves feel good. So the consequences of just focusing on the tax side of the equation, especially in a cost-of-living crisis, is that many people on low income—and most people who smoke are—will go and buy their product somewhere that it's cheaper. And where they are buying them cheaper is in the illicit tobacco trade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Higgins has a distinguished career as a professional doctor, and has quite rightly pointed out the trend of statistics over the last few decades, but sometimes you get a glimpse of a change in that in the short term, and we are hearing that from other medical professionals. Here is an article from 11 September this year, titled 'Surgeon unmasks 'open secret' making underworld fortunes'. Cardiovascular surgeon John Crozier has devoted his whole life to assisting people who have been affected by the tobacco trade, and when he saw an increase in people coming to his hospital, he started to ask why: why is this increase happening so suddenly? And he's finding that they're buying tobacco from illicit areas across Sydney, and we're seeing across Melbourne. In this particular article that I've got here, there was a quote that really struck me. It said: 'The trade is so good that the first faction in it immediately attempted to monopolise distribution by stamping tobacconists with an 'earn or burn' offer. That is, 'Sell our illicit tobacco, which has none of the shocking warnings or none of the taxes that come with it, or we will torch your shop.' We know that that's happening because we are seeing, particularly in Melbourne and Sydney, illicit tobacco shops being burnt down. So, in addition to the problem that this is creating for people's health, it is creating gang wars through our cities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course we should focus on taxing this. In part that offsets the health budget consequences. It is so important that we look at the enforcement end of this. Criminal organisations are rational. They will look at the enforcement in hard drugs like cocaine and other areas and say, 'Why would I take that risk when I can make us as much money as this and I can put the risk for me onto someone who is probably in fear of being deported, who is easy to influence and then are told they will be subject to violence or have their store burnt down if they don't do it?' I am also hearing from many small grocery operators who are doing the right thing, those who run IGA stores who do sell this and it is a big part of their income. They are seeing that drop off. People doing the right thing are being punished. People who are doing the wrong thing are getting away with it. At the moment, we are letting local councils enforce that. I have a lot of respect for local councils, but dealing with violent, well organised criminal organisations is not their job. We need to make sure that we resource the group that can do it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="298840" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr REPACHOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:22</span>):  Law enforcement agencies worldwide are confronting a growing challenge in the battle against organised crime. These criminal networks are resorting to increasingly violent tactics, such as arson, threats and assault, to dominate the illicit tobacco market and safeguard their profits in this country. Our border agency has made significant strides in countering this threat. Last year the Australian Border Force recorded over 120,000 detections of illicit tobacco, resulting in seizure of more than 1.77 billion cigarettes and over 867 tonnes of looseleaf tobacco. The ABF is expecting to surpass these figures this year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to acknowledge that border enforcement alone cannot fully eliminate this complex issue. Our government has taken a proactive approach to addressing this problem comprehensively by collaborating with justice, law enforcement, health portfolios and state and territory governments. Our federal agencies are at the forefront of efforts to curb illicit tobacco, targeting organised crime with a focus on disrupting priority illicit tobacco networks. The Illicit Tobacco Taskforce, comprising various agencies like the ABF, the Australian Taxation Office, the Department of Home Affairs, AUSTRAC, ACIC and the CDPP, channels its resources towards dismantling the criminal syndicates with the most significant impact on Australia's illicit tobacco market. The ABF is actively engaging with state and territory governments to foster greater cooperation in addressing all aspects of illicit tobacco, from offshore activities to importation to production and domestic manufacturing and sales.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Operational agencies have emphasised that raiding illicit tobacconists at local level won't solve these issues, as these organised crime groups are highly adaptive. Therefore the Illicit Tobacco Taskforce is collaborating with state and territory agencies across Australia to tackle the root problem and disrupt the criminal networks profiting from it. These efforts aim to make a more lasting impact against these groups. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Collaboration with the state and territory agencies has yielded promising results, with raids resulting in the seizure of more than 264 tonnes of illicit tobacco. By removing the tobacco crops, we have cut off the profits that could flow back to these organised crime networks. Additionally, during Operation Harvest Home, police seized over $1.4 million in cash, more than 2.8 million cigarettes, over 380 kilos of loose-leaf tobacco, and vaping products worth an estimated $5.3 million. The joint Operation Aberdeen, which involved various agencies, led to the seizure of $835,000 in cash, over eight million cigarettes, 3.74 tonnes of loose-leaf tobacco and 60,000 vapes, with an approximate street value of $1.8 million.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, the Illicit Tobacco Taskforce, in collaboration with the AFP, has been executing search warrants in New South Wales against illicit tobacco organised crime networks in an ongoing operation. In other states, the taskforce works closely with the joint organised crime taskforce to address and disrupt Middle Eastern organised crime syndicates linked to illicit tobacco. These operations are part of a multifaceted approach to disrupt these organised crime networks and prevent their profits from being channelled into other illegal activities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has adopted some of the world's most robust measures to combat the importation and trade of illicit tobacco. The ABF leads the government's efforts in this regard, underpinned by a package of illicit tobacco reforms implemented on 1 July 2019. These reforms include the regulation of tobacco as a prohibited import, the establishment of a tobacco import regime, the strengthening of illicit tobacco offences and penalties, the collection of tobacco duty and taxes at the border and the establishment of the Illicit Tobacco Taskforce. These measures have significantly enhanced the ABF's ability to detect, deter and disrupt illegal tobacco industry. Penalties for illicit tobacco offences include imprisonment of up to 10 years, monetary penalties up to five times the duty evaded, or both.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:27</span>):  I thank the member for Wide Bay for putting forward this motion and opening up the discussion about illegal cigarettes and vapes to more than what mums, dads, parents and teachers complain about. What it really comes down to is organised crime groups controlling this area. This is not new. Thirty years ago, when I was a detective, we were prosecuting people who were importing container loads of illegal cigarettes through Norfolk Island and Lord Howe Island.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The community needs to understand that this is more than just kids vaping at school or kids smoking illegal tobacco. These organised crime groups use this funding, use the money they get through the illicit tobacco trade and illicit vaping trade, to fund much more sinister tasks: sex slavery, cocaine trade and amphetamine trade—those things that make parents and mums and dads fear for their children. This is where they get their funding from. This is why it is so important that we have this conversation about proper policy to prevent the continuation of the illicit trade in both vapes and illegal cigarettes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can't expect our Australian Border Force, our AFP and our police to be able to police their way out of this. I'm specifically speaking about vapes now. Outlawing vapes will not work. It'll simply push that into the black market. I'll accept the coalition's policy from back in 2001, where you had to have a prescription to be able to use a vape, has failed. There are over 1.1 million users of vapes in the country now and only 10 per cent of them have a prescription. So what you are effectively seeing across Australia right now are shopkeepers who sell vapes acting illegally and people who use vapes breaking the law. If you do not have a prescription for an e-cigarette or a vape, you are effectively breaking the law. The reason that these organised crime groups are doing this is that it is low risk and high reward. There are effectively no penalties for selling illegal vapes in these pop-up shops which we have seen flow into our communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have sat down with legitimate tobacconists who have told me they are losing millions of dollars a year to these illegal pop-up shops. NSW Health has control over that, not the police. NSW Health has to go along and say, 'You are actually in contravention of New South Wales health regulations.' They shut them down for six or eight hours and, within that time, they have popped up again because they have a stash and a store of illegal vapes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we need to do is regulate this industry. I don't like smoking. I don't like e-cigarettes. But they are here to stay. The only way we can control this is by regulating the industry exactly the same way that we have regulated the cigarette industry—plain packaging, behind the counter and restricted to people over 16. It should be exactly the same way with excise. That would take that control from the organised crime groups. We would take that away from them. Then we can use Border Force to regulate those legitimate ones coming through and continue to prosecute those people who flout the law. As part of that, we need to increase the penalties for illegal e-cigarettes. We need to say to people, 'If you are going down this road, you are part of a criminal organisation and we will not stand for it.'</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:32</span>):  I would first of all like to thank the member for Wide Bay for moving this motion. It's something that has been very close to my heart for many, many years, having lost my uncle to lung cancer, an aunt to chronic emphysema and many other relatives to diseases caused by smoking. Illicit tobacco is both a cancer on our society and a leading cause of cancer in our communities. I am greatly concerned about the impact of the legal tobacco industry. Australia, as we know, has led the world in tobacco harm reduction, but our smoking rates are stubbornly around 10, 11 or 12 per cent or even higher in some communities, particularly Indigenous communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must do more to get those rates down because they have a significant impact both in terms of hours of care and in terms of cost to our health system not just from lung cancer but from a variety of other cancers, such as bowel cancer, prostate cancer and even breast cancer. Tobacco smoking increases the risk significantly for those cancers. There are also a number of people with chronic lung disease, emphysema and chronic obstructive airways disease that are putting huge pressure on our public hospital system. We must get our smoking rates down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, illicit tobacco is making this problem much worse. It causes significant harm in our communities. It reduces the cost of smoking because illicit tobacco is often sold much cheaper than tobacco that is regulated. This is one of the reasons our chronically stubborn smoking rates have been hard to get down. It is causing significant harm in our children and adolescents, especially those in lower socioeconomic communities and those who have been targeted by not only illicit tobacco but now illicit vaping products.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regardless of all these things, our government is taking action on both the legal and the illicit tobacco industry. Illicit tobacco is a major issue facing our nation virtually wherever you go in metropolitan, rural and regional areas. It has significant law and order implications, particularly in terms of control, and of course organised crime is heavily involved in the procurement and sale of illicit tobacco. It goes straight into the hands of organised crime, and they, of course, have no compunction in selling it to children. Despite the valiant efforts of the Illicit Tobacco Taskforce, more needs to be done. We need to make sure that we adequately police illicit tobacco, that imports are confiscated and that the money organised crime is making from these products is taken by the government as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also must be much stronger in policing our vaping products. We've already seen significant numbers of schools, including primary schools in my electorate of Macarthur, having to confiscate vaping products as well as illicit tobacco. There are joint efforts between the Illicit Tobacco Taskforce, the ATO and police in my state of New South Wales. Operation Junglevine2 involved raids on illegal tobacco plantations across New South Wales and the confiscation of 264 tonnes of illicit tobacco. By removing this tobacco from the market we are helping reduce our smoking rates and improving our health system at the same time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently the ABF supported joint Operation Aberdeen—which involved the Queensland Crime and Corruption Commission, Queensland police, the ATO, Queensland Health and the TGA—in confiscating almost $1 million in cash, eight million cigarettes and 3.74 tonnes of loose-leaf tobacco and 60,000 vapes. It's a huge industry. It's causing huge harm. Our government is working to police and to control illicit tobacco and vapes. We are doing our best, but organised crime is very clever. Organised crime requires significant policing, and our government is doing their best to make sure that we keep this under control.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Robert Menzies said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The country has great and imperative obligations to the weak, the sick, the unfortunate. It must give to them all the sustenance and support it can. We look forward to social and unemployment insurances, to improved health services … to a better distribution of wealth, to a keener sense of social justice and social responsibility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the words of Robert Menzies when social justice was a shared goal of the major parties in this country back in 1944. The Albanese government is getting on with the job in working towards that vision, now abandoned by the opposition. We seek to ensure that no-one is left behind because financial stress affects people's health, happiness, opportunities and life choices. The stress experienced by an individual is never theirs alone, but also shared by their family, friends and the community at large.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government understands and respects that at different times of our lives we will need or benefit from support, and that support can mean the difference between being able to access opportunities or otherwise suffering and being shut out of full participation in society. This is always true, but more so at a time when inflation, due to compounding international factors, is heightened and cost-of-living pressures more keenly felt. This government is committed to boosting payments, indexation and providing cost-of-living relief to those who most need it, evidenced by the $14.6 billion package announced in the May budget. And on 20 September, increases in the Commonwealth allowances took effect. These permanent changes will make life better for over 5½ million people—wholly one in five Australians. Back home in Hasluck, and in each and every electorate around the country, this works out, on average, to be more than 35,000 people who will directly benefit, and their families around them will benefit too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For children and parents, single parenting payment recipients have seen the base payment rise to $942 a fortnight. Single parents transferring to this payment after the government extended eligibility in the May budget to cover children up to 14 years of age, up from eight years, will have seen a substantial increase of $227.50 per fortnight, including supplements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For those looking for employment or upskilling, single jobseeker recipients have received a $56.10 increase per fortnight, the largest single permanent dollar increase to the jobseeker benefit ever in Australia's history. Adult Abstudy recipients have also received this increase, and partnered jobseeker and parenting payment recipients have received an increase of $54.80.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, for those who find work, we have legislation in the parliament now to ensure that people are not cheated and that workers receive proper protection and a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. For those looking for housing, despite those opposite—those in the Liberal and the National parties—voting against it, we have passed the Housing Australia Future Fund, which we were elected with a mandate to deliver. Additionally, over 1 million households will benefit from a 15 per cent increase in rent assistance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For seniors, people living with disability, carers and veterans, as a result of indexation there have been substantial increases to the age pension, the disability support pension and the carer payment. Single veterans will have received an increase of $32.70, and those on the disability special rate have received an increase of $53 per fortnight. There will also be an increase in educational allowances for veterans and increases to income limits for the seniors health card and other benefits. Further, this government has extended eligibility for the higher rate of jobseeker to many people aged 55 years and over. And let's not forget that this is the government that has brought about cheaper medicines, taken measures to assist with energy price increases, supported minimum wage increases and supported a substantial increase in the wages of aged-care workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Next month, our targeted support for Medicare takes effect. Bulk billing is the beating heart of Medicare, and after nine years of cuts and neglect by the former government we know it's never been harder or more expensive to see a GP. That's why the Albanese Labor government is tripling the bulk-billing incentive—the largest ever increase in the 40-year history of Medicare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Targeted support is not just a great thing for the individuals and families that will receive these benefits. In many cases, it also has an anti-inflationary effect. It enables spending on essentials and small businesses, and it is good for the economy at large. The increase in financial support that the Albanese government is providing during these difficult times is about meeting the needs of families around this country, helping individuals experiencing stress and enabling people to live their lives and access opportunities with dignity. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="300123" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WARE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:42</span>):  I rise to speak about this motion that deals with the cost of living. At the outset, I will say that it is refreshing to see a member of the Albanese Labor government who now actually wants to bring forward a discussion on the cost of living. However, with all respect to the member for Hasluck, this motion does not deal with the issues on the cost of living that I am hearing about throughout my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is not being spoken about in this motion is telling. It does not talk about Australian families struggling daily with the escalating costs of living, which has been occurring since May last year. It does not talk about the cost of energy. It does not talk about mortgage repayments. It does not talk about rents. It does not talk about the cost of fuel, the increasing cost at the supermarket check-out or the increasing cost of insurance premiums. It does not talk about the fact that real wages have dropped under the Albanese Labor government. It does not talk about productivity and what plan the government has, if any, to address productivity. It does not talk, overall, about what the government's intention is to combat inflation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's turn to some of these headline issues. Australians are now paying more than ever for their electricity. There is still no effective energy plan. The energy plan that has been introduced by Minister Bowen, instead of delivering the promised $275 cut, means that Australians are now paying at least 15 per cent more in energy costs than they were paying one year ago. There is no sign of any reduction in gas costs, which are up by 14 per cent on latest data. Fuel prices continue to climb, with unleaded petrol typically past $2 a litre. In my electorate, the electorate of Hughes, I have not been able to find a service station where we can purchase petrol for under $2.36 a litre, and rates are significantly higher in the regions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A third of my electorate hold a mortgage. An average Australian family with a mortgage of $750,000 is now paying $22,000 more a year than they were just a year ago. And the Albanese Labor government has not said what it is going to do to help these Australians. Australians in private rentals are paying on average at least 15 per cent more than they were a year ago. The government needs to put forward a back-to-basics economic agenda that will put fighting inflation and driving productivity growth at its centre. Inflation, overregulation and low productivity are the main problems now facing the Australian economy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to productivity, we are now in what is called a per capita recession. That means we've had two quarters where growth per person, growth per Australian, is negative. Outside of the pandemic, this is the first per capita recession we've had since the mid 2000s. This means that economic output per person is going backwards. And we've heard nothing from the Albanese Labor government. What assistance is it going to give to business for this? What assistance is it going to give to increase the productivity of all Australians?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what Australian families and businesses are feeling every day. It's what people in my electorate of Hughes have been telling me as I've been moving around the electorate. Cost-of-living pressures are not just an economic issue; they're also a social issue. Lifeline and beyondblue are now reporting that more than 80 per cent of calls are being made by Australians saying they are suffering from cost-of-living stress and personal debt. So, this has now moved beyond just an economic argument. It is now something that this government needs to address. It needs to address it quickly. It needs to stop being distracted by other issues and stop trying to distract Australians, because Australians know what their real issue is, and their real issue is cost of living.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hawke</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:48</span>):  I'm very proud of the work the Albanese Labor government is doing to ease the cost-of-living pressures that people in my electorate are facing. We know that Australians are doing it tough as inflation hits hip pockets around the country. Since early last year, when inflation and interest rates started rising in the dying days of the former Liberal government, Australians have been forced to pay more for the things they can't do without. That's why the Albanese Labor government's priority has been and continues to be addressing inflation and the cost-of-living challenge it presents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government's 10-point plan to address cost-of-living pressures is about providing targeted and responsible relief where it's needed most. The $23 billion of support is providing electricity bill relief, cheaper child care, cheaper medicines and more affordable homes, just to name a few. While relief is at the centre of our economic plan, we're also looking at repairing the damage done by the mismanagement of the former Liberal government. We've already delivered the first budget surplus in 15 years, and inflation is finally moderating. Wages are growing, after a decade of deliberate suppression under those opposite, and a record 550,000 jobs have been created. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While this shows the economy is improving under our stewardship, there is still some way to go as Australians continue to face the financial pressures we all feel at home. Australians on low and fixed incomes are doing it particularly tough. That's why a boost to income support was included in our cost-of-living relief package in the May budget. As of 20 September, 5.5 million Australians who receive income support saw an increase to their payments as well as an expansion of eligibility to ensure more people are getting the support they need. This included the largest increase to Commonwealth rent assistance in 30 years, an expansion of eligibility for the single parenting payment and increases to payments including JobSeeker, youth allowance, partnered parenting payment and more. The Albanese Labor government are boosting these payments because we are committed to ensuring vulnerable Australians are not left behind in times of economic hardship.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why we're ensuring other basic necessities are more affordable as well. Our intervention in the energy market has kept wholesale prices lower, while our energy relief program will provide more savings for concession card holders. Similarly we're making health care cheaper and more accessible. We've already reduced the cost of filling a script at the pharmacy by $12.50 and started rolling out 60-day prescriptions, effectively halving the cost of medications included in the program. From the start of next month we're tripling the bulk-billing incentive, the largest increase in history, to increase access to bulk-billed GP appointments for concession card holders and kids.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After inheriting a trillion dollars of Liberal debt, stagnant wage growth and an economy that had experienced in the worst decade for productivity in over 50 years, this Labor government is getting on with the job of cleaning up the Liberals economic mess. We understand that while providing responsible relief to household budgets we must also do what we can do drive down inflation. That's why we're investing in our economy where the previous government chose not to. We're making significant investments in economic capacity and productivity. The $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund will enhance Australian manufacturing capability and ensure Australia is a country that makes things. Our fee-free TAFE program, which saw 215,000 people enrol in just the first six months, will help ensure we have the skilled workers we need to grow our economy into the future. These measures are about laying the foundations for future growth and ensuring we are better prepared for global economic challenges in the future. We can't afford to repeat the decade of inaction and neglect we saw under those opposite. Labor's plan will ensure that our economy is resilient, it's sustainable and it is prosperous for all Australians into the future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:53</span>):  I rise today to highlight the extreme cost-of-living pressures so many in my electorate of Cowper are facing and the very real needs of middle Australia and those men and women who are now becoming Australia's working poor. I've listened to those opposite congratulate themselves for increasing payments to those who are already on some form of payment or welfare—and credit where credit is due, so they should have; they are struggling just as much. But recently I conducted a survey throughout my electorate, and it was a cost-of-living survey to understand why pensioners, single parents and those with disabilities are finding it tough. People are being forced to choose between eating and heating or medicine and groceries or limiting their time at home because the cost of fuel has rocketed. Given those examples, sitting here listening to speakers on the other side, where are the solutions? Where are the policies? It's not just about handing out money. There are so many holes in Labor's cost-of-living strategy bucket. We're pouring money into the top, and it's flowing out of the bottom. Where are the strategies to plug those holes at the bottom of the bucket?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We talk about reducing electricity prices. The last speaker said electricity prices are going down. He needs to visit my electorate, where prices have gone through the roof, over 30 per cent. Some may say, 'You need to go to renewables.' In my survey I asked, 'Do you have solar?' Over 65 per cent of those who responded said, 'Yes, we have solar.' That included rental properties. Only two per cent had batteries. I'll give you this idea for free: how about some subsidies for batteries for people in the regions—or even it in the cities, to make it fair. For policies and strategies to plug that bucket, instead of trampling all over our agricultural land, look at different ideas. Regions like mine don't want to spend that money. But they understand that this is where we're going, and they will try anything to push down those skyrocketing prices.</span>

                  </a>  Returning to the cost-of-living crisis in the regions and policies by Labor, many of them in fact impact negatively on people in regional and rural areas. One of those policy areas is cheaper child care. While I accept that it may assist people in metropolitan areas, I've just spent two days in Coffs Harbour and Port Macquarie meeting with childcare educators who are operating at 60 per cent capacity because they can't find the staff. Because of that they have waiting lists of 200 to 300 children even in the smaller townships such as Kempsey. So while Labor might say, 'We are making cheaper childcare', what they should doing is putting policy out there to create areas where we get more workers, more educators into the regions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, they talk about cheaper medicines. By bringing in the 60-day dispensing rules, what we've seen as a direct result is services that were previously provided free by community pharmacies, such as Webster dispensing and delivery, people in my electorate are now being charged $5 a week for the Webster-paks and $5 a week for delivery. That's $520 a year in addition to what those people were paying, over and above. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, in terms the skyrocketing cost of fuel, not too long ago Anthony Albanese, before he was Prime Minister, tweeted to the Morrison government 'Fuel is at $2.15. What's the Prime Minister going to do about it?' Well, fuel is now at $2.30. Prime Minister, what are you going to do about it? </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:09</span>):  I rise to speak in favour of the motion moved by the member for Hasluck in this place on the cost of living. Usually when it's my turn to speak on the cost of living it's during an MPI and we're arguing against many an argument the opposition continues to put forward. Some of those claims are entirely debunked, yet they continue because that's what the talking point sheet says. I feel we are somewhat at a disadvantage today, coming into this debate after a question time where cost of living was on the forefront of the agenda. It's fair for the opposition to ask these questions of the government. It's telling that the Albanese Labor government is coming into parliament during question time on the front foot, leading with this government's move to take the cost-of-living pressures off everyday Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of those on the other side of the chamber were of course part of the government that was so glacial and reactive that it literally took a global pandemic event to make any slight movements themselves to assist people who were in many cases already out of work due to pressures from the pandemic. The tail of circumstances always wagged the dog of the Morrison government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thankfully we now have a government at the helm that is proactive, a government that acts in a responsible way to assist families with cost-of-living pressures. Yet we have a opposition who now criticise the government for not being able to forecast the length of the illegal war that Russia still continues to wage in Ukraine. We do not blame the former government for the entire COVID-19 pandemic, but we must now, as a government who has inherited the Treasury benches they once occupied not too long ago, deal with the complications and spending that the Morrison government put in place to combat the sharp economic downturns that many countries face during that time, though it could be argued that the trajectory was moving downward for us prior to the pandemic. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But just the same, a government in theory must traverse external pressures from broad when attempting to mitigate their efforts at home. Even at home those opposite failed to mention the inflationary pressures and climate necessitating interest rate increases that existed prior to the election that saw them turfed out. They do have considerable form for employing tactics reliant on the Australian people forgetting events that were both uncontroversial and on public record too. Inflationary pressures and interest rate rises were extremely common across the world in other countries, much like the previous government spent where it could to try to avert a number of imminent effects of the pandemic on our shores. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Luckily, those opposite are now confined to backseat driving in our public discourse, confined to the sidelines, being an opposition of protest rather than one that can be an adult of the table and be a driver of economic reforms which, as they would full well know, this government foreshadowed long before they were elected. But time and time again during the life of this parliament those opposite, even when contrary to the opinions of their natural allies like the Business Council of Australia, to name one, had offered support of legislation such as the National Reconstruction Fund. They even blocked measures to give Australians cost-of-living relief with their power prices. But they will say that we are not doing enough. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are happy to address the opposition's concerns with fact. We must enact cost-of-living relief in a measured approach, lest those opposite say that any measure enacted is inflationary—which they have also done, for what it's worth. Our government is proud of delivering not just the first budget surplus in 15 years, though we don't have the mugs to prove it. We are seeing wages on the up, swimming against the tide those opposite put in place to bake low wage growth into the foundations of our economy. We have a 10-point plan that we will, every single day that the opposition wants to talk about cost-of-living relief, combat their base political argument with facts. We have made medicines cheaper for Australians. We have boosted income support payments. We have made hundreds of thousands of fee-free TAFE placements to take that cost away from those who want to upskill themselves and increase their potential earning capacity. After a long and terse stand-off that those opposite were a large part of, we are getting on with the job of providing affordable homes for Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sooner rather than later the coalition will have to make a choice about whether to be constructive in their criticism or remain critical in their criticism. I have absolute faith that the Australian people can tell the difference. They certainly will after the effects of our policies are fully felt after many global pressures subside. We will continue to fight for Australians. We will continue to fight against those opposite complaining that we aren't doing enough, when they have fought tooth and nail in this place and the media to prevent it.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:14</span>):  I'm not sure if this motion is the beginning of the government's attempt to suggest to the people of this country that they understand and are doing something about cost-of-living pressures, because it is a remarkable proposition to congratulate yourself for merely increasing payments indexed to inflation. That in real terms is no increase whatsoever. I suppose it belies the truth: how much this government has no appreciation of how tough it is out there for the average Australian family and the average Australian household.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of this country want a government that is focused on the issues that they care about and the issues that are impacting them. No. 1 on their list is the cost of living; No. 2 is the cost of living; No. 3, closely, is the cost of living; and then No. 4 and No. 5 are a tie for the cost of living. Those are the issues that the people of this country are talking about at barbecues, around the kitchen table and in the workplace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A message was sent to this government very clearly on Saturday that people want to see this government focus on issues that are concerning them, and I'm sure a lot of Labor members are reflecting on just what the results in their own seats are saying about what their communities think of how in touch or not they are with those challenges. I commend the member for Macarthur, who has been very honest and open. He said things on the record in the media today. Other Labor MPs have not, of course, put their name to comments, but I think that many in the government are finally realising that they need to take seriously the enormous pressure that is being felt by Australian families and Australian small businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a motion congratulating the government on the cost of living. Well, no-one stops me in the street and says, 'I'm so glad I've got a government that's really addressing the cost of living.' Ever since the government changed and Labor came in, no-one has told me that it's easier to meet a mortgage payment. No-one has told me that it's easier to pay a power bill. No-one has told me that it's easier to save and buy their own home. No-one has said, 'When I go to the checkout at the supermarket, I get a very pleasant surprise.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, of course, I am hearing the absolute opposite, as is, I'm sure, anyone that's actually in their communities. People are saying that they're having to make such difficult decisions—things like cancelling family holidays and taking on second jobs or more shifts. They're worried about whether they can keep their children in a particular faith based school that they've chosen to send them to, because all those costs are going up. The absolute necessity costs are skyrocketing, whether it's shelter, rent or mortgage payments, or buying fresh fruit and vegetables. Some people are saying: 'I don't buy fresh fruit and vegetables anymore. I go to the freezer section because it is actually too expensive, on my fixed income, to purchase things I used to be able to comfortably purchase, because of the way in which prices are going up.' That's the circumstance people are in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Imagine you're a family that usually goes up to Port Broughton, if you're from Adelaide, or another holiday spot for the long weekend. Maybe you stay at the local caravan park or a home that you've usually hired over the years. Imagine saying to the kids: 'We're just not doing that this year. That holiday that we always look forward to just won't be happening because our household budget is absolutely crunched at the moment.' Every time you get an envelope with a logo of one of the utility companies, you think: 'Wow, I don't even want to open that right now. I might leave it a day or two, because every time I open a power bill, even though I expect it to be going up—because that's unfortunately what I've been conditioned for—the velocity of those increases are just frightening.' In South Australia, there are stories of increases of more than 20 per cent in the average household power bill since July. That's the reality out there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got a motion before us with a government saying that they're really proud of things like indexing support payments to people. All that means is that they're keeping up with the spiralling costs that are burdening the average person. Of course, inflation is a broad measure. Increasing payments by inflation is not anywhere near meeting the increase in your power bill or the increase in your rent. Those sorts of costs are going up in this economy way more than inflation is going up. So it is really tough out there right now, and it's a little bit galling to have a government come here and congratulate themselves on a topic that the average Australian thinks they are absolutely failing on. I hope that they take note of some of the messages that were sent to them from some of their safest electorates on the weekend and recognise what the people of this country want them to be focusing on, which is cost-of-living relief.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What has Labor delivered on infrastructure? It has started a 90-day review that has put the productivity and safety of our nation on hold for—wait for it!—169 days and counting. More than 400 congestion-busting, productivity-enhancing and life-saving projects are threatened by Labor's razor gang review, projects like the Truro freight route in my electorate of Barker. This project is incredibly important to my electorate. The Truro freight route is important to our state and to our broader nation. This project is part of the freight route between Adelaide and Sydney via the Sturt Highway. Major freight companies currently travelling through the main street of Truro know exactly how important this project is. The 500-odd residents of Truro know how important this project is, and they want trucks off the main street too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed the residents of Adelaide that I doorknocked with the member for Sturt, who has only just left the chamber, know how important this project is, because it's a key part of the Greater Adelaide Freight Bypass that will get heavy vehicles out of Adelaide. The former coalition government knew how important this project was because we funded it in the 2021 budget. Unfortunately, the Truro freight route is one of 400 projects across the country that is facing the chopping block under this Labor government. The best case we can hope for is that Minister King acknowledges its strategic importance in our nation's road network, but even if the project is saved from Labor's axe, it will have been delayed six or more months, and we all know the costs of road construction aren't getting any cheaper.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was advocating 12 months ago for more funding for the Truro freight route to ensure it could be a dual-lane carriageway. Now I'm fighting for the project to proceed at all. This is just one example of the chaos this Labor government has inflicted on our nation's infrastructure pipeline. Hundreds of projects across the nation are in the same position. Recently, in my role as a shadow minister, I was in the electorate of Casey with their exceptional member. We met with communities there who are desperate to see the Montrose roundabout replaced with traffic signals. I also visited Groom, where I spoke to residents about the need for turning lanes on the New England Highway at the Borneo Barracks at Cabarlah. Right across the nation there are infrastructure projects under threat, and it's holding back our nation's productivity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, I've heard loud and clear from my own community in Barker as well as the communities I've visited with colleagues about road safety improvements that are expected to come from these projects that are now on the chopping block. Australia's National Road Safety Strategy sets out a commitment to reduce annual fatalities by at least 50 per cent by 2030. After years of declining road tolls, Australian road deaths have risen significantly in the past 12 months, and the strategy's targets are well off track. The Bureau of Infrastructure and Transport Research Economics' data shows Australia's road deaths have increased 8.4 per cent over a 12-month period. Despite these alarming statistics, investment in road infrastructure has been put on pause while this government reviews projects under the infrastructure investment pipeline and redirects funding to Labor's pet projects in suburban areas. I repeat: 169 days later, we're still waiting on the outcomes of the 90-day review, and that's after the government had 13 months before they announced their review at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just specific projects; it's programs too. It's Roads to Recovery, $500 million of funding that local government relies so heavily on. It's the Black Spot Program and its $110 million. Local governments and state road authorities are waiting for calls about that. There's the Bridges Renewal Program and the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's call this what it is. The 90-day infrastructure review is a sneaky, cost-cutting tactic so Labor can fund pet projects in metropolitan centres like the Suburban Rail Loop in Melbourne and other city based stadiums. Labor's infrastructure priority is becoming clear. It's to cut road projects to help fund stadiums and transmission lines such as Brisbane's live music arena at $2.5 billion and Tasmania's $305 million. These are the wrong priorities. We just had a national conversation about the wrong priorities, and the Australian people have said that this is not the right path.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While those opposite kowtow to their state Labor counterparts, local communities are left in limbo, waiting for the next accident to happen. We know the review has been completed. The document is sitting on the minister's desk. I repeat: that's a 90-day process that is now approaching 170 days. It's now understood the report needs to be made public, and it should be made public now. Let's get on with it. The government have these results. They have them to hand. Release them. That's as well as telling states and territories what's in the report and what they can expect. We need this to provide communities with certainty about their future and to deal with hard-fought-for gains on road safety upgrades.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr REPACHOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:26</span>):  Labor governments have a long and proud history of building infrastructure that our country needs. We build the things that our country and communities need to grow and thrive. The people in the Hunter already knew this before the election. They are reminded of it every time they drive on the Hunter Expressway delivered by the Rudd Labor government. Since our election, the people of the Hunter have again been reminded that there is only one party that delivers on the infrastructure that is needed in our country and in our regions. They are reminded of that when they see the progress on the Singleton Bypass. They are reminded of it when they see the works beginning on the Muswellbrook bypass.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For a decade, the people of Singleton and Muswellbrook heard of these projects. They heard the chatter about finding a way to ease the congestion and the traffic in their small regional towns. But, for a decade, they remained stuck in traffic, not knowing whether the bypasses would ever become a reality. Now, after a decade of talking about these two projects, progress is being made. 'What has changed?' you ask. After a decade of talk and no action, there is work actually starting to get done. The answer is simple: the Labor Party was elected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If that's not enough to convince you that we are the party of infrastructure, let me tell you a little story that the member for New England might be more familiar with. In 2021, the road between Merriwa and Willow Tree collapsed. As a result, the road was unable to be used. The name of this road was Coulson's Creek Road. This road was part of a route which was vital for so many in the transport and agriculture industries. Since the closure of this road, those transporting goods, including stock and feed for farms, have had to make a significant detour just to be able to make it to their destinations. This has added up to $500 for each trip for some.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You would think a local member would jump straight onto this and get the funding to fix the road as quickly as possible, especially when that local member belonged to a party which was in government for much of the time this road was closed and a party which claims so often to be for the regions and for farmers. I have news for the people of New England. The National Party and the member for New England were not there when this road was closed. They did nothing, despite knowing that this closure was costly to so many.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a party that really stands up for regions, especially when it comes to providing infrastructure that is needed. It is us, the Labor Party. We were elected to government and we have delivered what that member failed to do while he was in government. We have committed $38.6 million towards fixing this piece of infrastructure which is needed by many in the electorate of New England and also the Hunter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The key difference between us and those opposite is that we don't make commitments just to win votes. We don't write promises on the back of beer coasters and throw them out in the bin after we are elected. We make a commitment and we deliver. When infrastructure is needed, we build it, whether it will bring us a political gain or not, because without delivering the infrastructure that this country needs we will fall behind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that we were left with a pile of mess by the previous government. There were projects that were poorly scoped, were underfunded and simply could not be delivered. Under the coalition, the number of infrastructure projects blew out from nearly 150 to 800. But they failed to deliver. Commitments mean nothing if we cannot do, if we cannot and do not deliver them. The minister has received an independent strategic review for the infrastructure investment program report. Let me tell you, I've had some pretty poor report cards in my time, but none as bad as this. This report highlights just how badly the Liberals and Nationals managed the infrastructure investment program under their wasted decade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we are turning this around. As a government, we are committed to maintaining the 10-year infrastructure pipeline at $120 billion, and we will ensure that the transport infrastructure projects that we deliver are nationally significant and nation-shaping projects. Only a Labor government cares about infrastructure.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="E0F" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WOOD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">La Trobe</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:31</span>):  I rise to support this motion on investment in infrastructure and am greatly concerned about this 90-day review, which has now blown out to 169 days and counting. I heard the previous speaker talk about Labor's commitments. One of the projects the former Liberal government committed to back in 2019 was Wellington Road—$110 million. Well, I've got a media release here dated 3 May 2019 from the member for Maribyrnong, and there was also an unsealed roads project we committed $300 million for, matched by Labor, yet they've walked away from it. That hasn't even hit this review, quite sadly. That's already been cancelled.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is not under review, though, is the state Labor government's massive rail loop, which could cost up to $200 billion. That is not included. You'd think that would be the first project to be included. They've also put a pause on the Airport Rail Link, a $10 billion project.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then I come to my own electorate of La Trobe. La Trobe is one of the fastest-growing growth corridors in the country. I'll talk about Clyde Road in Berwick, as well as McGregor Road and Racecourse Road in Pakenham. Again, in 2019, after these three roads were committed by the former Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, Labor came out and matched those projects. So, to say that the Labor Party will honour projects that they have previously committed to is completely false.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Clyde Road goes through La Trobe as well as through Bruce and Holt, two Labor held seats. Initially the project cost that we announced in 2019 was $50 million. Now, we didn't come up with that figure. That was actually Casey Council, one of the largest councils. They built massive projects, such as the Bryn Mawr bridge. It was their cost of $50 million. Then we were told by the state Labor government that it blew out to $250 million. So, again, in the 2021 budget we committed to that funding. For the Labor Party and the transport minister to say that projects are unfunded—we put extra funding into this one. Now, it's a ridiculous cost, considering that this road is probably only a duplication one kilometre long on Clyde Road, from the grade separation of the train line down to just over the Monash Freeway—for $250 million. But, importantly, it included Kangan Drive upgrades for turning lanes left and right from Kangan Drive onto Clyde Road.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is really important for the local hospitals. We have the nurses there, and the Labor Party talks about the great work that the nurses have done. Well, the nurses, the medical staff and the patients of Casey Hospital and St John of God Hospital every day get stuck at that horrible intersection. So, that is one project that Labor must commit to and deliver. In actual fact, $41 million has already been cut out of the last budget. Original funding for the Pakenham road projects—both Racecourse Road and McGregor Roads—was $70 million, back in 2019. Again, this is funding proposed by Cardinia Shire Council—we on the Liberal side of government didn't just make up these figures. Under the state Labor government it has, amazingly, blown out to $392 million, and will duplicate Racecourse Road between the freeway and Henry Street, widen McGregor Road between the freeway and Webster Way, and signalise the intersection of Bald Hill Road. The freeway interchanges with both roads will be upgraded and new on- and off-ramps installed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All these three projects I've mentioned had the support of the state Labor member out there, and even former premier Dan Andrews. I think it was the current Premier who actually wrote to him in support of these projects. So, number one: the Albanese government say that these projects haven't got state government support—they have. Number two: when they say they have not been fully funded, that's rubbish because extra funding was put into this. For the residents in Pakenham, on this occasion, who have put up with such poor roads—and it's such a huge growth corridor—it's so disappointing and disgraceful that the road funding is now paused and potentially may not go ahead. Stage 1 will go ahead, but not stages 2 and 3. It's a disgrace. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:37</span>):  I'm very pleased to rise to speak about the independent review of Australia's infrastructure program. What an important opportunity as we all gather here today in the Federation Chamber.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is committed to cleaning up the mess left behind by the Liberals and the Nationals. We will deliver infrastructure projects that are economically sustainable, are resilient to climate change and offer lasting benefits for our nation. The report from the independent strategic review of the Infrastructure Investment Program has been received by the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, and the comprehensive review has shed light on the mismanagement and the negligence of the Liberals and the Nationals during their period in office, especially during the Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One example, locally, in my own electorate, is Balaclava Station. It was one of the list of stations on the former government's Commuter Car Park Program, which was all about this idea of building more car parks at our train stations. It was one of the key pillars of the former government's infrastructure portfolio, and the previous government even committed $15 million to the Balaclava Station Commuter Car Park Program. I thought, look, it's not my cup of tea, this whole program, but I'm not going to say no to $15 million. So we said to the federal government, 'Whereabouts at Balaclava Station do you want to build these commuter car parks?' because East St Kilda is a pretty dense part of Melbourne. They said: 'Just behind the station. There's a car park there that we can put in some more multilevel car parks'—which came as a great surprise to the state and local governments, because the City of Port Phillip had already signed a deal to turn that land into social housing. In fact, that land was state-government-owned land and it was a collaboration between them and the City of Port Phillip. Now there lie 49 apartments behind Balaclava Station. It's one of the fantastic examples of collaboration between local government, state government—even the federal government ended up contributing to the project.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But despite committing $15 million to Balaclava Station, had the former Morrison government picked up the phone to any other layer of government and said, 'By the way, we want to build car parks there,' they would have found out that the land was unavailable. What did the previous government do? I can tell you they did not take that funding and put it somewhere else in Macnamara. They didn't reinvest somewhere else in Macnamara; they completely deserted Macnamara, just as they did at the last election. The former government were not interested in the people in Macnamara. It must've been taken off the spreadsheets they had in the Prime Minister's office. That's how they governed a lot of the former government's spending. But Balaclava station was then added onto a new list, which is the list of cancelled infrastructure projects of the former government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're taking a different approach. We're going to make sure our infrastructure program agenda is one where we work collaboratively with other levels of government, where we work collaboratively with communities, where we get value for money and also where we have the investment in our communities so we can have the benefit long into the future. If we had continued down the path laid by the Liberals and the Nationals, we would not have been able to meet the cost pressures put on existing projects or add new ones to the pipeline until 2033. When you look at the sorts of examples the former government just threw money at without thinking, that clearly was an unacceptable situation. This underscores the fact that while the previous government made a lot of grand announcements, including at Balaclava station, they consistently failed to deliver for the Australian community and for my own community in Macnamara.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're obviously taking this matter more seriously, and the minister is reviewing the report and will announce the government's formal response to the recommendations in due course. Our commitment to maintaining the 10-year infrastructure pipeline at $120 billion remains. We will be spending every cent on infrastructure, and we'll be ensuring the transport infrastructure projects we deliver are nationally significant and nation shaping. We're going to prioritise the projects that benefit all Australians, not just the ones designed on Liberal Party spreadsheets. Our approach will be, as I said, in genuine partnership with state and territory governments to plan, fund and deliver the highest priority infrastructure our community needs. It's going to create jobs, it's going to be good for communities and, unlike the previous government, we'll actually deliver what we say we're going to deliver.</span>

This is causing an enormous amount of grief and heartache in my electorate. I'm really pleased to have the former Deputy Prime Minister and one of the best infrastructure ministers this country has ever seen sitting here next to me, who backed projects in regional Australia and not only backed them but came up with policies that were relevant for infrastructure—Roads of Strategic Importance, roads that linked into other major infrastructure projects; roads like the Coonamble-to-Tooraweenah road, which now after a lot of planning, design and preliminary work there's a shadow over; and roads like the bypass around Gilgandra, where the council was texting me only on the weekend wanting to know what was happening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With grade separations the member for Riverina and I met with the councils terribly concerned about the safety issues on these major roads and their interface with Inland Rail. A contribution from the previous government to build these grade separations is now on ice. One at Moree not only was a connection over the Newell Highway and the Inland Rail but was the missing link in the piece of infrastructure to actually get the special activation precinct underway. I'm not one for giving kudos to Labor governments, but the New South Wales government in their budget actually continued the commitment to the special activation precinct in Moree and added to it. That's in stark contrast to what we've seen from this minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Reviewing and looking at these things while the cost goes up—as you drive around the Parkes electorate now, the work that's going on is the work that was funded by our government: $258 million on the Newell Highway between Narrabri and Moree; there's another $108 million there for north of Moree funded by the previous government. But work on the Inland Rail has ground to a halt in my electorate in a major way. There were major retrenchments; there are contractors who have gone to finance companies, borrowed huge amounts of funds to purchase equipment to take part in this major project, the most important infrastructure project in the last hundred years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard a lot in the last month about how the government cares about Aboriginal people. When they stopped work at Moree, about 100 Aboriginal people lost their jobs. On one hand we talk our virtue up in Canberra while we rip the heart out of local communities, people that had jobs, sometimes the first job they've had for years. I have spoken to these people out on job sites. I spoke to a lady north of Moree who was working in traffic control on the Inland Rail. She said it's so good to have a job. They're gone. On a slightly similar subject, the work that has been happening now on reforms to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan will rip more jobs away from Aboriginal people.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So this minister needs to get her hands out from where she is sitting and actually do her job. Making stuff is hard. Stopping stuff is easy. When you had a government that's full of a union hacks that have spent their whole life stopping things, they find it very, very hard to start things. So I wholly support member for Barker on this motion. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:47</span>):  I heartily agree with everything the member for Parkes has just stated on this motion on investment in infrastructure put forward by the member for Barker. The member for Barker and the member for Parkes and particularly other regional members in this place, in the Liberals and the Nationals, are very concerned about the 90-day review put in place by the member for Ballarat, the minister for infrastructure, prior to the May budget. Sadly, the 90-day review has blown out to 169 days—169 days where regional communities and regional employers, regional small businesses have had to pause, stall, procrastinate and wait for a decision to be made by this Labor government. It's not good enough, I say. This government should explain why the review was necessary in the first place. We heard earlier one of the speakers from the government say that if we had just gone along with it we wouldn't have had any new projects put in place until 2033. The projects put in place by the former government were good projects. They were good programs, and they've all been delayed or abolished by this government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can remember going out with the member for Parkes on some of his dirt roads, country roads, and seeing the farmers, seeing the councils—not just in the member for Parkes's electorate, which is half of New South Wales, but so many of the electorates right throughout the country—indeed, yours, Deputy Speaker Archer—and in Tasmania, to talk to people, to listen to people and to see what a game changer the infrastructure projects were that we were building and announcing, that we had in place with the vision that we had to build a better Australia, and the difference it was making to those councils and those communities—changing lives and saving lives. It's probably no coincidence that, sadly, the road toll at the moment is all too high. So many councils are just begging for money because of the pothole situation in regional and rural Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst they wait, the government is delaying, is procrastinating, is putting in place a review, but we don't know how long it's going to go for. It has already gone on for 169 days. I asked the member for Ballarat how much longer do these communities have to endure, how much longer do they have to suffer? How many more jobs and good people are we're going to lose on projects such as the signature Inland Rail? But not just that. Indeed, the East West Link in Melbourne was just ripped up by the Andrews government, at the cost of millions of dollars, without a piece of bitumen being laid. But it doesn't seem to worry those opposite when they burn projects off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just look at the Commonwealth Games. I was in Ballarat for a committee hearing just the other day. I let the member for Ballarat know I was in her electorate, being the good and courteous member of parliament that I am—I don't get the same courtesy shown to me. Let me tell you, in the anger in the evidence that we took at one of the joint select subcommittees investigating education and tourism from people affected by that decision to rip up the Commonwealth Games contract was palpable. They were just furious at the lost opportunity. The Victorian government says it will build infrastructure to replace it. We'll believe that when we see it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I listened closely to the Prime Minister in question time today responding to a query from the member for Kennedy. The Prime Minister was talking about infrastructure. He was puffing out his chest and I heard him saying, 'Well, we're spending $2 billion on water infrastructure.' I can remember putting in place another $3½ billion on top of the money we were already investing in water infrastructure, so where has that money gone? Those opposite aren't interested in building water infrastructure. They are not. If they were they would have partnered with the New South Wales government to raise the wall at Wyangala. They would have promoted Dungowan Dam. They would have built Emu Swamp dam near Stanthorpe. But they're not interested in water infrastructure. They're not interested in building roads. They're just interested in stalling and procrastinating and extending the 90-day review, which is now 169 days.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:52</span>):  I want to commend the member for Barker for this very important motion, and also thank him for coming to visit my community in Casey so that he could see and understand firsthand the impact of this pause in the 90-day review that has now been going for more than 130 days. We visited Maroondah Highway and Killara Road in Coldstream, as well as Canterbury Road in Montrose, to speak to residents. I'll talk a little bit about those visits and the impact that it's having on my community in particular.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Maroondah Highway and Killara Road work was funded by the federal government in 2019. The money was there for the Victorian state Labor government to deliver that project. They had it for over four years. The state Labor government did not get the project started. We've been waiting as a community for four years, and now that anguish has been extended because we are on an indefinite wait for this project. This is a dangerous road, a dangerous intersection that needs lights.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Coldstream CFA, the Gruyere CFA have been calling for this upgrade because their stations are on this road and they get blocked in. They cannot get out to save people when every second counts in an emergency. They have called for this road to be upgraded. The money was there. State Labor and now federal Labor are stopping this project. My state colleague Bridget Vallance and I will be having a community forum next week, on Tuesday 24 October, to again talk to residents because they are frustrated and they are angry that this project continues to be delayed and there is no certainty for them. We will continue to fight and hold this government to account for their broken promises.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And it is a broken promise, because the then opposition leader, now Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, in his campaign launch speech, his big statement on what he was going to do, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… <span style="font-weight:bold;">We will invest in infrastructure to boost productivity and create jobs.</span></span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We'll improve regional roads and major highways.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can put that down as another broken promise from this Prime Minister, and they're starting to gain rapidly in numbers, because they're not investing in infrastructure. It is on pause. It has significant impacts for the Coldstream, Yarra Glen, Healesville and Gruyere communities, and many others, but it also has impacts on people and on their livelihoods.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was at the Wandin Silvan Field Day this weekend, speaking to many locals. I spoke to a young man called Tim, who runs his own earthmoving business. We were having a great chat about a variety of things, and he was telling me about his business and his work. I said, 'How have things been?' He said: 'For the first time ever, it's slowing down. With all these infrastructure projects being put on hold, I'm not sure how much more work I'm going to have.' That is the impact of this government's decisions. When you delay infrastructure from 90 days out to 130, it costs people jobs, it creates uncertainty for them, and it is disgraceful that this minister continues to drag her feet. But she does have money for the Suburban Rail Loop! There's $2.2 billion for the Suburban Rail Loop.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go back to the Prime Minister's speech. That was a Labor promise, so they're going to honour that—conveniently. There's another broken promise from the Prime Minister:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Labor will put the focus back on nation-building infrastructure using the Infrastructure Australia model I created as Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was the Prime Minister in his campaign launch. Guess what? The Suburban Rail Loop did not go through Infrastructure Australia, so this Prime Minister has broken another promise to the Australian people—$2.2 billion dollars as a down payment and tens of billions to go, with a statement that does not stack up for the people of Victoria, and certainly not for the people of Casey. He is pulling money out of the Killara Road out of Coldstream. The Canterbury Road upgrade is vital for the Montrose community and, importantly, for the families that that live in the Yarra Valley—the upper Yarra—because they use Canterbury Road as a way to get home quickly. That duplication, removing that roundabout and adding traffic lights was going to improve safety and—really importantly—allow businesses to be more productive and allow people to get home quickly to their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are just a couple of examples of this government continuing to break promises, failing to deliver for the communities of Casey, for Victoria and for the nation. We are seeing an out-of-touch Prime Minister and it is costing Australians every day.</span>
