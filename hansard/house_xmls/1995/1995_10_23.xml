          , continues the interest of the committee in issues of public administration and, particularly, the continuing reform of the Commonwealth's financial management. In 1990, the committee tabled a comprehensive review of the financial management improvement program, the banner under which many financial reforms were introduced. Last year the committee reported on the efficiency dividend, a controversial aspect of current funding of running costs.

          In our view, it is obvious that the aim of a better Public Service—that is, a more efficient and effective one—is very much in the public interest. We are all familiar with the famous example of the hospital with no patients from the TV series
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

          With the reforms of recent years in mind, the committee inquired into the devolution of running costs flexibilities within agencies. As the name suggests, running costs are the costs of running government, the costs of delivering programs to the targeted clients of government. In the main, they consist of the salaries and administrative costs incurred by Public Service departments and related budget-funded entities.

          The total cost to the Australian community of departmental running costs is expected to come in at $7.37 billion in 1994-95. This represents 7.6 per cent of total government outlays, or 8.5 per cent of total government revenue. In our view, it is important that the management of these resources not only be efficient but also contribute to the effectiveness of program delivery for the benefit of clients and the community at large.

          Under the running costs arrangements, agencies can manage their budgets in a way not unlike commercial entities. In loosening control over internal budgetary management in budget-funded agencies, it was intended that responsibility for exercising real control over budget flexibility should be exercised at the lowest practical level in the management pyramid.

          Before summarising the findings of the committee in this inquiry, it is important that I define devolution in the context of the Australian Public Service. Devolution is classically defined as the downward transfer of authority to make decisions to the most practical level of management. It is the `who decides' of management. By improved responsiveness to the local environment, devolution holds the promise of better value for money and improved client service. In this respect, the classical definition of devolution is, however, incomplete. To us, devolution includes not only the concept of who is best placed to make a decision but also who manages the budget to fund the decision and, more significantly again, who is able to take action for the benefit of clients.

          As the title of the report—
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Keeping the customer satisfied
          </emphasis>
          —suggests, client service has been the central theme of the inquiry. We believe that is quite correct. It is clear that devolution goes to the heart of what the community loves to hate in the public sector when they deal with, for example, the local DSS, CES or branch of the tax office. That is, can the manager at the local level change anything for me, or make any real decision to help, or is he or she merely a conduit for a remote state or central office, bound by procedure, sympathetic but impotent. The recent ANAO report into the Department of Social Security also focused on inefficiency, and particularly commented that it resulted in poor standards of customer service.

        <para first-indent="16">

          The committee concluded that, on the whole, the current extent to which running costs management has been devolved was disappointing and left room for considerable improvement. Throughout the APS, devolution could be described as uneven. While we acknowledge that devolution has had its spectacular failures, which partly arose from overoptimistic expectations, we conclude that devolution should be applied more widely where the risks and costs are less than the benefits in improved service.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The committee made two major findings during the course of its inquiry. The first is that improved public sector management through devolution needs an incentive in order for it to be widely introduced. Such an incentive should stimulate greater efficiency and effectiveness, and improved client service. Where there is no incentive, agencies will not take the risk of changing the status quo.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The committee observed that the most effective incentive for the spread of a devolved management was the introduction of contestability into the management environment. Contestability is most often associated with the introduction of commercialisation into the public sector under the auspices of privatisation, corporatisation or any other type of way that user pays funding arrangements can be introduced.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Obviously, commercialisation is inappropriate for large sections of the budget funded sector. Nevertheless, we believe that there is scope for the increased applicability of the principle of contestability within the budget sector. An example of this principle which impressed the committee was the notion of a corporate levy. This levy acts as an internal efficiency dividend and is creamed off the top of running costs budgets. Internal units of the organisation are then invited to bid for the accumulated funds.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          A related concept to contestability is output based funding. Currently, agencies are funded on the likely costs of inputs such as salaries and administrative expenses. Guaranteed input funding may not encourage efficiency and greater client focus, as the financial viability of the agency is not at risk if it fails to deliver the services demanded of it. In the committee's view, there is scope for further study on the subject of funding models which strengthen the connection between agency funding and outputs.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The second major finding of the committee is that devolution involves a cultural change in the agency concerned. The hospital with no patients that I referred to earlier exemplifies what many in the community and, indeed, in this parliament may see as the Public Service attitude—where the means actually become the end and little attempt is made to identify and serve the clients of government programs who, after all, are the taxpayers.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The inquiry found that devolution usually precipitates a change in the culture of agencies, and this change is related to the major incentive for the introduction of devolution. In a contestable environment, particularly where market pressures have been introduced, cultural change aids efficiency and a focus on clients. In budget-funded, non-commercial agencies, cultural change and devolution are spurred on by APS initiatives such benchmarking, continuous improvement, workplace bargaining, the efficiency incentives of the running costs arrangements, the efficiency dividend and cash limited budgets. The committee saw this cultural change as positive where the interests of more efficient management and greater client service were served and where attention was paid to the high standards of probity and accountability with which the APS has become synonymous.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          In making recommendations for change, the committee was mindful of the continuing need for ongoing reform in the Australian Public Service and notes that various initiatives are under way to improve service delivery and to promote value for money within agencies. We believe these initiatives need to be encouraged.

          Under the influence of information technology and the global economy, the fundamental processes and role of government will be reassessed. The salient question for those in the public sector will be: where do we add value; and what do public sectors need to do well in order for their citizens to compete in a global economy? As the committee stressed throughout its report tabled today, enhanced client service should be the goal of devolved management. The committee believes that, in pursuit of this goal, new directions in public sector management are worthy of further deliberation.

          It is an important report for two reasons. The first is that it provides a very useful update on how extensively and successfully devolution has been pursued in the Australian Public Service. The second reason is that it provides a useful commentary on the challenges facing the public sector in the 1990s.

          I, like other members on this side of the parliament, want the public sector to succeed and we want it to continue to play a liberating and equalising role in our society. But the public sector can only succeed in the 1990s with public support, public good will and ultimately the funding support of the public through the taxation system. It therefore follows that our aspirations for more active and interventionist government in the 1990s rely on more effective government.

          This is the central management challenge for all parts of the public sector. It is a challenge that is made much more complex and acute by the way in which people these days are comparing public sector performance with private sector service. People are more likely to regard themselves as consumers than producers. Successful organisations, public and private, feature the adaptability needed to satisfy rapidly changing consumer demands. Flexibility and dexterity are essential, bringing together temporary alliances of personnel and know-how to address each market niche. Within this framework, the usefulness of a rigid approach to ownership and reliance on fixed production assets has basically expired.

          This was demonstrated throughout the committee hearings by examination of large nationwide departments administering national laws—departments like tax, social security and DEET. They find it hard to be as responsive to their clients as smaller units, both in the public and the private sector. If we could conclude an adage out of this report for public administration, it would be that small is beautiful and flexibility is effective.

          These large nationwide departments with their centralised culture are, according to our findings, much less inclined to devolve their running costs flexibilities. The task for public sector managers is to find the methods of motivation, devolution and improvement to give the public sector a growing place in our society.

          In this respect, I think it is important to note that altruism, while commendable, is not enough. I was intrigued at one of the hearings to listen to Ms Hamilton from the Department of Human Services and Health about the motivations that her department applies for its staff and the task of devolution. She stated:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         I think it is desirable to conform with corporate culture. As a person working in a small organisational unit, you would know that the corporate culture says that making efficiency gains is a good thing, and that in making efficiency gains you are smiled upon by the hierarchy of the department and flourish in the department. That would be one of your main motivations.
        </para>
        <para>
         I admire people with a positive altruistic attitude to their work but more is needed. I think it is self-evident that more is needed. We need the sorts of competitive influences and motivations ending in guaranteed income as much as possible. I join with the member for McPherson in expressing my interest and excitement about the way in which the Department of Finance, under this government's stewardship, is examining methods of output based payments for the Public Service.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          We need to maximise contestability. The committee found a whole range of benefits in the Attorney-General's Department and in the Department of Administrative Services where contestability has produced efficiency and enhanced devolution. We also need to decentralise government as much as possible. Smaller rather than larger units are going to be most responsive to customer needs in the current environment.

        <para first-indent="16">

          There is also a very strong finding in this report that links the industrial relations environment in the Public Service to productivity gains: that is, to re-examine the effectiveness of the efficiency dividend and to replace agency bargaining with genuine enterprise or workplace bargaining as a method of enhanced public sector efficiency.

          Another key finding is the use of new information technology to break down fixed overhead costs in these large departments. I am pleased to report to the House that, in our assessment, Social Security and DEET are two departments which are using information technology outlets, flexible and service based, to enhance their responsiveness. The use of computer terminals in shopping centres and community halls as an outlet for departmental information is a very effective means by which overhead costs can be broken down and the public sector can be more responsive to its clients. This in part reflects the reinventing government agenda. It makes a commonsense point about the need to minimise the fixed assets of government and maximise flexible new sources of government intervention. This is a sensible response to the sorts of dynamic, economic and social changes that our community and our nation face in the 1990s.

          —The parliament is well served by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, which I have recently been pleased to serve as chairman. In particular, the defence subcommittee comprises individual members across the political spectrum, members with a genuine interest in the defence of the nation. It also comprises two former portfolio ministers and those who have served in the ADF. This report that I am tabling today reflects their good work and consideration. Judged by the number of recommendations, the report is modest and unflattering. However, the report represents a fundamental shake-up of officer education.

          From the outset, I wish to place on the public record the fact that the ADF merits commendation for its commitment to officer professional education and development. It is second to none. The high quality of the officer corps is a product of individuals who are in it and the commitment to professional development, education and military training. The ADF has for some years sought to engage our regional neighbours. Part of the strategy has been to send ADF officers overseas to defence colleges and, in turn, accept overseas officers in the Australian Defence Force colleges. This policy serves Australia well. This report does not review specific war fighting skills, although I would expect this report to have an effect on the provision of such training. In the main, it does not cover modern media and methodology for delivering officer education, nor the provision of short and sandwich courses. But clearly the ADF could and should move in this direction.

          The committee was not critical of any of the nine establishments reviewed as part of its terms of reference, nor critical of the outcomes. The ADF is rightly proud of its traditions. The committee was concerned to review performance in relation to how it would cater for the military after next. This is predicated on the assumption that the next military will be only slightly better; and one seeks to leapfrog with incremental improvements. As I have said, the ADF is rightly proud of its traditions but should not be frightened of creating new ones.

          The committee envisages that there will be greater reliance and flexibility in the use of reserves and mobility between reserves, part-time officers and regular full-time officers. Indeed, an officer's career may involve periods of full-time/part-time activity and periods of absence in the civilian work force. It is not to be expected that the ADF will always be able to nurture the expertise of some specialities in-house. Occasionally officers will wish to temporarily opt out, for family reasons. Until the problems of civilian employment are overcome, it will not be possible to fully train up reserves, as envisaged in the total force concept, and this will inhibit training of reserves allowed for in this report.

          The opening of the Australian Defence Force Academy in 1986 followed a long period of investigation and consultation. The decision was made in the post-Vietnam environment and generated some controversy. It was based on two important considerations. It guaranteed the ADF a supply of university graduates into the officer ranks, and it pioneered jointery at the earliest stages of an officer's career. However, ADFA isolates undergraduates from their peer cohort in 37 other universities and therefore precludes the development of an understanding of different views, attitudes and beliefs held by other university students. In an ADF increasingly dependent on the community, informal community networks and links are stillborn at ADFA.

          Historically, notwithstanding the intense selection procedures, ADFA does not enjoy a superior graduation rate than other Australian universities. The cost to the ADF is half the $200 million spent on education and professional development of officers. The cost to the ADF for each graduating officer from ADFA is $308,712. It is hard to justify this cost based on the defence criterion of acceptable premiums and value for money. This is at a time when there has been significant underemployment for undergraduates, even for engineers who are often cited by defence as having more attractive options in civilian employment. Ordinary Australians will not understand the enormous cost per graduate of over $300,000 and will seriously doubt that this cost represents best value for increasingly scarce defence dollars.

          It is for these reasons that on balance the committee believes the undergraduate component of ADFA should be phased out. It should be replaced with a university scholarship scheme. The scheme, recommended to commence in 1997, is about selecting 1,000 students prior to their commencing university studies and being allowed to study at the university of their choice. Again, prior to commencing they would be required to undertake a basic military skills course during their undergraduate studies. They would be required to undertake further military training during part of the semester breaks.

          Table 15.5 shows one of the options considered by the committee: the estimated cost of the scheme, a saving of some $60 million allowing for a 20 per cent loading for allowances recommended by the committee. Indeed, some care would need to be taken regarding the amounts suggested by the committee for the scholarship as they are likely to distort the market and further work will be required.

          The new scheme is radically different from the military nunnery approach of ADFA. The decision to join the ADF as an officer is after graduation and would be a more mature and better informed decision than those currently being forced to be made at high school. It also provides for those candidates who do not make the final selection after graduation to be offered places in the reserves as officers or places as other ranks—either regulars or reserves. However, the ADF would be under no obligation to offer a position to any scholarship holder who did not make selection into the regular officer corps. The ADF would have the opportunity to increase the number of university graduates entering all ranks of the ADF, regular and reserve.

          The committee recommended that a feasibility study be conducted into the establishment of a triservice precommissioning college of no more than 12 months duration. Such a course would have common military subjects as well as single service elements. In my view all officer candidates—both regular and reserve—should be trained at the college. The triservice precommissioning college would provide jointery for everyone at the earliest stage of their career and would not just be for an elite within the officer corps, as ADFA currently provides.

In my view, the ADFA should be able to attract leading military and academics to join the teaching staff from Australia and overseas. Given the changed role proposed for ADFA, its governance would need to change and a new military and academic board would need to be established.

Although it remains difficult for the ASC to attract and retain people with specialist skills, the ASC has not expressed any concerns that its effectiveness is being significantly impeded by staffing difficulties.

The committee had received representations that businesses had been structured so that the employees of the business were employed by a company with limited assets while assets of the business were held by a separate company. If these businesses cease, the company employing group employees have no assets with which to pay accumulated holiday pay, long service leave or redundancy payments and are placed in liquidation. Principals of the business retain control of its assets in a separate company where they are not accessible to employees or creditors.

          In June 1995 the ASC announced that it would target `strings of companies' or `phoenix' company chains in a community response project. The ASC said that it would particularly focus on directors who have a history of moving from company to company, leaving a string of debts behind them. In August 1995 the Attorney-General announced that the Corporations Law Simplification Task Force would examine this issue as part of stage 3 of the simplification program. It will look at how to tighten up the rules on the disqualification of people who abandon companies with unpaid debts and without winding them up. The Law Reform Committee of the Parliament of Victoria has also examined this issue. The committee is encouraged by the interest being taken in this important issue and welcomes the developments in overcoming it since the committee's last report. The committee will continue to monitor developments on this issue.

          —In speaking to this report of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, I wish to note one particular aspect of concern to me, and that is the question of class orders and the way in which class orders are granted by the Australian Securities Commission. I am going from my recollection of the evidence given, but my concern basically is this: the Corporations Law, together with Accounting Standard 1017, require that third-party related transactions must be disclosed. This matter has been a topic of some conversation and some reportage in the last little while. But it is possible to get a class order under the Corporations Law which relieves the directors of the corporation and the auditors from reporting on related third-party transactions. The mechanism for doing that is to apply to the Australian Securities Commission for such an order.

          In this case, my concern was particularly raised because the Bankers Association had requested an extension to the class order because an amendment had been made to tighten up the reporting requirements. The Bankers Association had written a letter on behalf of the banks, but the text of that letter was very specific to the Commonwealth Bank and its reporting time. The request was that the class order should be made expeditiously. In fact, the class order was made expeditiously.

          When we held a public hearing, I asked representatives of the Australian Securities Commission who attended just how that class order was dealt with, who signed it and what rigour it was put through to see whether or not it ought to have been granted. When I asked those representatives from the Australian Securities Commission whether they realised that, once that class order had been granted, the relationship between the now Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his piggery group of companies and the Commonwealth Bank did not need to be reported on they replied that they did not know that that would be the effect of the order. I then asked whether it would have made a difference to their giving that order, and they replied that they certainly would have been more hesitant and would have given it far more consideration.

          My specific concern relates to the effect that the class order had in preventing information as to Mr Keating's dealings with the Commonwealth Bank, bearing in mind the relationship between the government and the Commonwealth Bank, and particularly the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and the Commonwealth Bank, and the need to have transparency. The broader principle also applies, and that is the degree of scrutiny that is given generally to such an application. In the report we say that we will continue to monitor this situation, and it was an important issue to raise.

In speaking to the report, I commend the work that is done by the committee, but it was that particular matter relating to class orders that I wished to highlight.

        The United Nations has had remarkable achievements during the last 50 years. The organisation has contributed to a whole series of global problems in effective ways.

        No-one would argue that the United Nations has been as successful as we would like. That is patently clear to everyone. But it is also clear that many former areas of conflict are not now areas of conflict because of the effectiveness of United Nations organisation officials and the work that they have performed. The United Nations has contributed, often in very effective ways, to economic and social development in developing countries. The United Nations has led the global debate concerning the crucially important area of the reduction of poverty. The United Nations development program, UNICEF—the United Nations Children's Fund—and many other parts of the organisation are involved in that crucial activity and have contributed effectively.

        It is also true that there have been inefficiencies. Too many people who are not the best that their country has to offer have been appointed. Far too commonly countries have not kept up to date with their financing and have then blamed the United Nations for inadequacies which are really the direct result of underfunding and members being in arrears. We are all aware that the United States and Russia are the two principal countries which are seriously in arrears at present. They are therefore undermining the effectiveness of the work of the United Nations.

        It is very important that the United Nations recognises the challenges which it is going to face in the future. Those challenges are being multiplied by the fact that we now live in an increasingly globalised world, one in which the role of the United Nations must be increased and intensified. Many of the global problems of pollution, the spread of disease, drug trafficking, conflict resolution and economic and social development have an international dimension which can only be effectively handled cooperatively, internationally and through the United Nations organisation.

        That means that funding must also be maintained and increased. It is essential that the countries that are in arrears pay their statutory obligations quickly but that, as well as that, new and additional sources of funding be found so that those international requirements are effectively fulfilled. Many proposals are now around for this. There is the possibility of a small levy on international travel and a small levy on international financial transactions, which would also, by the way, contribute to reducing international financial instability. These mechanisms are potentially available and are receiving increased attention.

        These criticisms aside, there is evidence that but for the UN and its activities the world today would have not made the progress that it has, particularly in the less developed countries. Major achievements include that it has provided the means by which many former colonies have attained independence peacefully, and it has rallied opposition internationally to racism and apartheid. The specialised agencies, such as UNICEF and the world food program, have brought comfort, indeed life, to many thousands of malnourished and dehydrated children and to refugees.

        Thirdly, there is a need for clearer distinction between peacekeeping and peace enforcement mandates, with future mandates having more expressed objectives, adequate resources and a limited scope and duration. Consideration needs to be given to rapid reaction capability, particularly a permanent operational headquarters responsible for contingency planning. Finally, funding shortfalls should not be financed by global taxes as suggested by the foreign minister recently. He should be embarrassed by recent disclosures that his own department argued strongly against these as totally impractical.

        Funding difficulties need to be overcome by member states themselves meeting budgeting allocations. For example, for the years 1989 to 1994, the assessment levels for the United States' share and each of the other UN members' shares show that the United States and 15 other nations contribute or pay between 82 and 85 per cent of the UN budget. Only four countries, including the United States, as the honourable member for Fraser has said, consistently failed over the six-year period to pay the entire assessment annually and maintained unpaid or outstanding contributions.

        Financial calamity beckons even now.

Washington's arrears amount to $US1.4 billion, or nearly a third of the UN's combined budgets of $US4.5 billion. It might surprise a lot of people that in August the UN was arguably insolvent. It was unable to pay its bills but for some initiatives that were passed by a meeting of the General Assembly. Former British ambassador to the United Nations Sir Anthony Parsons has said:

        I think the United Nations is unfairly criticised from time to time. Bosnia is often cited as an example of the failure of the United Nations. I think a more accurate assessment would be to say that the European countries, the European Union, have totally failed in Bosnia and that the United Nations has been forced to go along with their initiatives, or lack of initiatives.

        —We live in an imperfect world, so I suppose we should not be surprised that when the nations of the world beget a world organisation it is far from perfect. Today we are commemorating the 50th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. When one reads some of the articles marking the occasion, one wonders just what hope the United Nations has. Their titles talk of a midlife crisis and ask, `Is the UN beyond rescue?' But when we talk of the United Nations today, we should remember the ideals that inspired its founders 50 years ago.

        The ideals that inspired the UN are the great ideals of Western civilisation. Indeed, one of the greatest problems with the UN is that its strongest supporters are its worst enemies. They expect it to do too much. The UN is often used as a scapegoat. It is treated as if it is an independent actor. However, the UN is only as good as its members. When we look at Bosnia, for example, we see that the members of the Security Council bear much of the responsibility for the years of bloodshed, not the UN itself.

Idiot ideas such as the suggestion of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) for a world tax to finance the UN will not solve its problems. Instead, the UN needs to undergo reforms so it can meet the realities of a new world environment.

        The United Nations was constrained by the Cold War and divided by two opposing blocks for most of its history. Over the past five years, however, it has been asked to act as a global emergency service, a role for which it has not been prepared. We must consider the UN's limits. It has been able to provide a worthwhile forum for the airing of grievance and disputes and has performed well over the years in its peacekeeping, policing and mediation roles. However, it has not been able to engage in nation building exercises, such as in Somalia, or in managing the civil wars, as it has tried to do in the former Yugoslavia. Attempting to overreach only discredits the organisation and distracts from its worthwhile work.

        The upward shift in economic power and increasing internationalisation are creating new demands. Already, the ability to post a letter or make a phone call overseas depends on a web of UN agencies and agreements. Globalisation will create new demands for international treaties as, by necessity, government at the supernational level will be cooperative rather than autarkical and contractual rather than sovereign in nature. This is where much of the UN's future lies, and if we are to properly deal with this new international environment we must ensure our own federation has formal mechanisms for state consultation and an increased role for this parliament in ratifying such agreements.

These words will mainly focus on the perceived failings of the UN. But what is the real failure of the UN? The real failure is that the sovereign states who comprise its membership have never given the UN the power it needs to do its job effectively.

        The UN is used as a scapegoat for the inability, or more often the unwillingness, of many states to make tough decisions. The worst offender in this regard is the United States. The United States was happy to use the UN in the early days when the majority of members were supporters of the US and the US could get its way on almost every issue. This was especially true during the period that the Soviet Union boycotted the Security Council.

When it could not get its way, the US spat the dummy. Just as the US had never joined the League of Nations, so it spat the dummy at the ILO and UNESCO and, although remaining a member of the UN, has been supercritical of the UN.

        While people always dwell on the perceived failure, little thought is given to the successes. How often have conflicts been averted by quiet diplomacy or preventive diplomacy? The major achievements of the UN are that it has provided the means by which many former colonies have attained independence peacefully and it has rallied opposition internationally to racism and apartheid. The specialised agencies, such as UNICEF and the world food program, have brought comfort—indeed, life—to many thousands of malnourished and dehydrated children and refugees. The World Health Organisation has improved health in many parts of the world and it played a major role in the eradication of smallpox. It has become the key forum for negotiating international agreements on civil aviation, communications and the management of resources on a global basis. The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea is an obvious example of this. The UN has become the logical arena in which to tackle issues that require a cooperative global approach such as the environment, drugs, terrorism, refugees, AIDS and population and development.

If the Security Council is going to be effective, we have to have a re-look at the five permanent members.

        Before examining a number of these issues in detail, let me make one thing perfectly clear. This is not an ABC bashing exercise. I am not ABC phobic; quite the contrary. It is my respect for this great institution and my belief that it is compromising its integrity with this move—that its board has either been manipulative or manipulated—that leads me to this criticism. Further, I have no hang-ups with appropriate nationally based electronic media programs. It is the balance of national, state and regional programming that I call for.

        I believe we are seeing here a dangerous centralising of opinion making. When I say `manipulative' or `manipulated', let me go back over the last 15 months. At the beginning of that period, former ABC managing director David Hill announced that there would be a major change to ABC news and current affairs programming. The ABC board proposed three distinct programs: 6.30 state and regional news; 7 p.m. national news, and a 7.30 p.m. national current affairs program. As we know, there was a national outcry and the board backed down. State based news and current affairs were to stay, or at least we were led to believe so.

        It is now obvious that the board or management or both never really accepted the decision in good grace. The seeds of change had been planted and there was evidence that the cat was to be skinned in a different way. We have only to listen to the former head of TV news in Victoria, Mr Jock Rankin, in his submission to the Senate Select Committee on ABC Management and Operations, in which he said:

      <para>
       There has been no consultation. If the charge that the Stateline idea was dreamed up in the last three weeks before the board's decision is true, then there certainly has been no research and no comprehensive consideration.

        What is worse is the crass way the ABC dressed up its offsetting measures. After new managing director Brian Johns told us that he was quite aware of public and staff concerns about the centralising of ABC news and current affairs, he dished up four sugar-coated pills which I would like to examine briefly. Firstly, TV News is to be left untouched. I, Paul Neville, ask: for how long? If the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         7.30 Report

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Secondly, there is to be a new state based, once-a-week current affairs program Stateline—and, wait for it—at 10.30 on a Friday night. You have to be kidding to believe that this is anything else but a pathetic sop destined to fail or at best languish in super low ratings. It is doomed before it starts. What does the ABC think the average intelligent Queenslander or Western Australian does at 10.30 on a Friday night? And how about the ABC's wonderful variety and family entertainment show

        Thirdly, a new national weekly program

        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         7.30 Report

        programs like a sugar-coated pill. The reality, however, lies in the fact that New South Wales, with 34 per cent of the national population, has over 50 per cent of ABC staff and produces just under 50 per cent of all programs while, in comparison, Queensland has 17 per cent of the population, eight per cent of ABC staff and produces six per cent of ABC programs. The tendency to even greater centralisation is seen in the supposed staff allocations for the new national

        Over recent years we have seen capital city daily and weekly banners eliminated or merged. The bulk of the metropolitan print media is now controlled by three groups and two groups dominate regional print media. These features are bad enough, but at least there is a diversity of opinion and, in most instances, editorial independence. In radio, the widening of the spectrum, the FM phenomenon and narrow-casting have ostensibly created greater diversity. Sadly, when it comes to news and public opinion, the reverse is true. Larger and larger networks are being formed, with blocks of programming—sometimes in the morning, sometimes at midday, sometimes in the afternoon and almost certainly at night—coming out of that centralised network system. Some radio stations are little more than relay transmitters. In fact, one commercial station in my area transmits on-line programs from 9 a.m. to l p.m. There is no local programming whatsoever for the morning program.

        A fundamental point needs to be made: it is all well and good for members from various states to stand up and make their local points, but one needs to take a close look at the various policy prescriptions that respective parties take to elections. I remind those opposite of what they were committed to at the last election. Page 247 of Fightback, under the heading `Communications', says:

       That came in at about $6 million for SBS and $50 million for the ABC. What does chopping $50 million out of the ABC do? It makes absolutely sure that the ABC has no capacity or facility for any local or regional production of news and current affairs programs.

       The decision made by the board last month does not pick up all of the proposals of the August 1994 suggestion. In effect, local news production is saved but local current affairs dies.

        There has been a trend, not only in the ABC but also in other television and radio, to get away from the hard-edge current affairs program and move towards chat programs, which of course have some value and are certainly popular in the community, but there is no substitute for good investigative journalism. I think the ABC has some responsibility in that respect. The ABC also has a responsibility to provide balance not only in reporting current affairs issues but also in reporting state and national issues, as well as international ones. As communications improve, there is a greater opportunity for us all to be better informed.

        The shadow minister for communications has been quoted fairly extensively today and I quote him again. He has said that the ABC has a responsibility to broadcast prime time, state based current affairs programs. But that is in addition to his argument of favouring a move towards a national approach, which I would have to say that I support, as long as there is that balance. When newspapers in various states concentrate heavily on state and local issues, it is important that the ABC can give balance and so greater insight into national issues. While nationally a 7.30 report is a good idea, it should not be at the expense of localism, because there is a need for state based issues also to be examined in detail. If one night a week and at 10.30 was to be the only time that could happen, it would be a poor thing for each of the states.

        Since the first reading of this bill on 24 August this year, I have received widespread and strong support for this bill and its clear intentions. The aim of the bill is to ensure that Australia's defence forces do not engage in any sort of cooperative activity—be that joint training exercises or exchange of officers, equipment, technical knowledge, intelligence information, military hardware or any other assistance—with the armed forces of another country which uses those forces in a deliberate act of state policy to suppress the human rights of its own people or the people of another country.

        By embracing the cause of those who have been denied their human rights, Australia also guards and reinforces the nature of those rights themselves.

        While human rights and international humanitarian law ostensibly inhabit different fields, examination of the Geneva rules reveals how they are intimately related to universal protection of human rights, especially in relation to internal situations. In fact, it is difficult to distinguish where human rights end and humanitarian law begins. Even the basic view that one relates to peacetime and the other to wartime situations is not totally correct: for example, both the ICCPR—

        One of the most important protections from a human rights perspective afforded by the Geneva Conventions is "Common Article 3", so called because it is found in all four Conventions, which ensures that some basic protection is accorded to civilians in all situations—whether it be international or civil wars, or wars of national liberation. Not only does this provision ensure that persons not involved in combat are treated humanely and without discrimination, but it also sets out absolute prohibitions against violence to persons, (including murder, torture and mutilation, hostage taking, outrages on the person's dignity such as humiliating and degrading treatment), and provides for due process.

         The bill under debate today does not mention any particular nation as being the target. This bill, if passed, would require the Australian department of foreign affairs to engage in careful scrutiny of the operations of the armed forces of all nations with which Australia has any form of defence cooperation. It is clear, however, that with only a few nations would any defence cooperation be brought into question. Indonesia is clearly the most obvious and is a country where the evidence is overwhelming.

         In a few weeks, we will be marking the 20th anniversary of the Indonesian military invasion of the former Portuguese colony of East Timor. In early December 1975, Indonesia sent over 30,000 troops into East Timor, engaging in the systematic destruction of thousands of homes, killing more than 60,000 East Timorese and beating and torturing thousands of others. So commenced a 20-year reign of terror over East Timor by the Indonesian military which has resulted in over 200,000 people being killed, some 60,000 refugees fleeing the island for other places around the world and a continuing repression of the rights and liberties of the people of East Timor.

It is absolute folly to believe that we are improving the training or actions of the Indonesian military by cooperating with them. There is no evidence at all—as the 1991 Dili massacre and the recent beatings, arrest and torture of 150 youths just last week show—that the Indonesian military has any concern for human rights.

         —I listened with some interest to the speech the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) made in addressing the Defence Cooperation Control Bill 1995. Whilst I would agree with the honourable member on many issues, I do have a little difficulty in agreeing with his precise position on this one. It is not because I do not agree with the importance of human rights—I am very supportive of human rights, and I think we do have to address those issues—but we are talking about a particular bill that the member is presenting to the House that, on the surface, is designed to talk about defence cooperation.

         I thought by this stage I would probably have had to pull some teeth to get to the basis of this bill. But halfway into the member's address, he clearly highlighted what it is about: it is his understanding that it is about Indonesia and East Timor. In that regard I have no difficulty with the issues he addressed. However, frankly, there are some issues in that area which I think all Australians have some concern about.

         This bill goes far further than to address the problems of particular areas. This bill looks at the use of our armed forces in training and developing the skills of military, and gaining exchange benefits throughout the world with those activities. The bill does not address just East Timor; it looks at countries right around the world.

         The bill requires that the Minister for Foreign Affairs provide a certificate to be given to the Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence, the Chief of the Defence Force and the Chief of Staff and that it also be presented in parliament within six days of the minister receiving it. Also, that certificate is to be based on information, collected by our Foreign Affairs representatives overseas, as to whether there is any conflict that the military forces of a particular country are involved with that would be seen as a human rights issue.

         On the surface, once again, I have no real problems with the principles that the member is putting forward. But there are many areas of conflict where countries in our region could find themselves with their people within causing them difficulties. For example, if we look at the situation in the Philippines, would the Philippines be precluded because of the Muslim groups to the south of the country? I suspect it would. On the basis of what I have read in the information—and I am not sure whether that is a line that the member would intend to be precluded in that process—I think the bill provides far too rigid a line for a Prime Minister or for a Chief of the Defence Force to work to.

         With human rights, I think it is important that we have dialogue. Dialogue is one of the greatest areas on which we can rely through which we can achieve a change in people's views. In fact, if there had been more dialogue in connection with Yugoslavia, maybe there would not be some of the difficulties in trying to reach peace solutions that there are today.

         In the area of provision of training, I think our defence forces have done a wonderful job in years gone by with their work on training courses in Australia and in other countries with officers of other military forces.

         The reality is that, if we get into a conflict at some stage in the future—and, heaven forbid, would I hate to see that situation arise—it is far easier to be able to open dialogue with somebody on the other side when you know them. It is far better to be able to work the processes through and to talk the system out, understanding, firstly, some of the thinking that some of these people have but also with their understanding you as a human being.

         From a human rights point of view, when we get past the bells and whistles of this piece of legislation—which talk about putting in place a very rigid process—and get down to what occurs on the ground and what we can achieve out of continuing and worthwhile dialogue, I am confident that a far better dialogue can be achieved by the arrangements we have seen in place with our defence forces over the years. Are we really suggesting in this bill—because the member has highlighted the issue with Indonesia—that we cut off each and every negotiation with Indonesia in a defence capability?

         I suspect that is what this legislation really does say because it talks about any of the negotiations and discussions, any elements of training.

         Whilst the member for Moreton said that this bill does not mention any particular nation as being the target and that he would have liked us to talk about the Defence Cooperation Control Bill as being something that can be looked at for all nations of the world, 50 per cent of his contribution was devoted to Indonesia and East Timor. I suspect that he believes in his heart that is what the bill was established to do in the first place. I am not sure that the foundation of the bill before us at the moment has been a good foundation.

         We could work on the basis of saying, `Our people from Foreign Affairs in the field have got all the solutions as to how we sort out our defence relations.' Basically, the bill says that we should use whatever evidence can be put together from the diplomatic posts in the country. That information would then be provided to the minister in the form of a certificate. Information regarding how that was determined and who would and would not be involved would be determined by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and then passed on to the minister. We would then go through that process of organising our cooperation with defence forces overseas. That would create a massive administrative system that is not necessary. We put in place in this country under our democratic processes a government of the day which will make decisions in the interests of the people. Frankly, if we were to put in place a mechanism whereby there can be a considerable amount of argument over who does and who does not get involved in defence cooperation with Australia, it would only create more and more unnecessary paperwork. I would be far happier to see the funds that would be consumed in that area being spent more wisely in the area of cooperation. Frankly, if the member for Moreton were to think through that process, I am sure he would think of more constructive ways to solve the difficulties in East Timor.

         A copy of the certificate is to be provided to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence. If we are going to organise this cooperation, it is fairly clear that the minister would be aware of the processes anyway. In some areas, I would suspect that, if those negotiations had not been established and were to be initiated, the Prime Minster would be made aware of the arrangements, particularly if it is a very low level of training. We are not training these forces to be at the top echelon and to be as capable as we are in many of these areas.

         The member for Moreton did not particularly want to discuss the conflict in Bougainville, but was he suggesting that we are not going to have any training relations with Papua New Guinea because of it? I am concerned about some of the comments that I have read about the human rights abuses in that area. But to suggest that, as a result of this, a certificate would be presented that showed that there was some conflict between the people in the country and the defence forces which meant that we would not have a military relationship with Papua New Guinea is ludicrous.

There is no doubt that everyone in this chamber has a commitment to human rights. That is a notable feature of Australian political life. The strength in this parliament of Amnesty International is a very clear indication of the fact that commitment to human rights has the strong support of people in all parties and the Independents as well in this House. The question is not whether that is at issue but what we can do to encourage the implementation of human rights in other countries.

         I have to say, by the way, that the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson), in supporting the idea of dialogue, was supporting something which is in no sense inconsistent with the bill that is before us. Quite clearly, dialogue is the first and most obvious technique to use when trying to influence the development of human rights in other countries and is in many ways the most constructive technique because it does not involve attempting to enforce anything. It involves simply open discussion, which can well have an influence. The flow of ideas is one of the most effective ways of influencing the way any individual or country behaves.

         This procedure is very similar to that which the honourable member for Moreton is proposing. He is proposing that the foreign affairs department would evaluate a country with which the defence department was considering cooperating and it would then issue a certificate provided it was clear that cooperation was not going to contribute in any way to suppression of human rights.

         That kind of procedure is relatively simple. It may not be absolutely straightforward to implement, because there are always countries which are borderline in relation to behaviour. One that was raised by the honourable member for Isaacs is Papua New Guinea. I think it would be possible under this procedure to still have defence cooperation with PNG.

         There was a particular complaint about misuse of helicopters in Bougainville some years ago, but I know well that the government in Papua New Guinea was very opposed to what happened then and has been attempting to ensure that there is no repeat of that action. One could not say that, overall, there was any suppression of human rights in PNG. I do not think this bill would lead to a breaking of defence cooperation with that country, which in many ways is our closest neighbour and the one with which we have most interdependence and for which we are most responsible.

         —I obviously acknowledge the good faith and good intentions of the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) in putting forward this private member's bill, the Defence Cooperation Control Bill. My comments in no way should be taken to diminish or criticise his honest intentions in this very important matter. However, as a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and as one who was able to participate at the end of the subcommittee's work in the report that has been tabled,
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          A Review of Australia's Efforts to Promote and Protect Human Rights
         </emphasis>
         , which I commend to all members, I think the report is well worth reading in the context of the honourable member's bill.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         As far as I can see—and in the couple of minutes I have it is very difficult to summarise a report of this magnitude accurately and not to misinterpret it—the report clearly acknowledges, after very careful deliberation about the complexities of our world and about the operation of Australia's role in peacekeeping, that the use of armed forces, regretfully, is on the agenda and has to be part of Australia's role in the world. Indeed, we have a very proud record of participation by our armed forces in peacekeeping in the world. We are not seen as a threat to anyone, yet we have been welcomed and we have done good work in respect of using our armed forces in peacekeeping.

         I believe the effect of this bill could shackle the operation of this nation and its participation with respect to peacekeeping. On page 84, paragraph 5.2, there is a summary of the declaration of the charter of the United Nations which we all try to support and subscribe to. In this 50th year of the United Nations we should all reflect on it. Part of that charter states:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security, and to ensure, by the acceptance of principles and the institution of methods, that armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the criterion a government of the people elected by the people of Australia has to balance: `in the common interest'. The wording of the bill acknowledges that United Nations' operations which affect the rights of people in a state or another state are okay. I refer to clause No. 10, which says that, notwithstanding everything beforehand, it will be okay for Australia, if it is part of a UN operation, to become involved in, unfortunately, a deliberate policy affecting the rights of people in another state. But the bill says that, in all other operations that are not United Nations' operations, it is not okay.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I know the honourable member feels that perhaps I have oversimplified it, but that is the effect of the bill on international law and domestic law. The United Nations charter acknowledges the possibility that member nations will have to unite for the common good and sometimes provide armed forces for the purposes of indirectly or directly affecting the rights of people in a state or in another state. That is an unfortunate consequence of UN operations and peacekeeping operations generally. So it really is unrealistic for legislation of this type to be carried to shackle a government in performing its duties.

         I personally think that dialogue is the solution. In respect of these conflicts that do arise, dialogue by a nation such as Australia with a reputation, good will and an acceptance by many nations is the way to go. Whilst success does not come overnight with respect to responsible dialogue, you do win in the end. That is why I support our cooperation with some of our Asian countries and with New Guinea. Sometimes I get very concerned about reports of their operations in their domestic fields and with their neighbours. But if we are to cut off our relations and dialogue with them, we are going to have a worse situation in the region and for the world eventually.

         So it is far better not to try to legislate, albeit in good faith, but to use our commonsense, the principles of the United Nations charter and the examples we have set ourselves as a nation in peacekeeping to achieve the right sort of cooperation and to be prepared where necessary to protect people's interests by using our armed forces in a peaceful way.

They were there to let Senator Alston and I know just what they thought of the idea of Vodafone taking possession of land there to erect a tower. The owner of the land, Bob Cruse, was also there. He is powerless to stop Vodafone from constructing the tower. He is quoted in the local press as saying, `I think the Commonwealth law that gives these people the right to enter people's lands without their approval is a bad law.' They were also there to let the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) know just what they thought about the national code which allowed the erection of these towers, which put no brakes on carriers such as Vodafone.

         —The Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett, must have known that there was no evidence at all to suggest that the Save Albert Park group or the Labor Party was in any way involved in the placing of metal tacks on the cycling track at Albert Park yesterday. That was a criminal and antisocial act. The Premier said that he was sickened that the Grand Prix protest group and the Labor Party had put people's lives at risk. The Premier himself is sick when he chooses to slander the Labor Party and a group of my constituents, many of whom have voted Liberal more often than they have voted Labor. They are honourable and decent Australians who have protested, as is their right, against the destruction of their park for a formula one motor racing track.

         If the Premier had checked with the police, he would have been told of a similar incident in 1992, well prior to any Grand Prix proposal for Melbourne, when in a city race approximately 400 competitors had punctures caused by tacks being strewn on Beaconsfield Parade. Mr Kennett abuses the office of Premier when he resorts to these tactics. He not only chooses to smear those who disagree with him but in so doing exposes himself as a deliberate, wilful and premeditated liar. As such, he dishonours the very important office of Premier of Victoria.

         —The Kennett government's latest act of urban vandalism—the Citylink freeway—probably ranks as its greatest act of arrogance and stupidity. In effect, this project will destroy any hope for a sophisticated public transport system in Melbourne. Those right-wingers in the federal government who support the privatising of public utilities and public infrastructure will not get out of this one scot-free either. The more governments reduce outlays and leave infrastructure development to the market, the more the public is at the whim of profiteers and the corporate mates of government.

         The fact that the Keating government provides tax concessions for infrastructure bonds for these freeway building cowboys reflects its commitment to the privatising of public transport. No matter how much John Brumby and Peter Batchelor whinge about Citylink, the fact is that they support the widening of the Tullamarine freeway. Throughout the Citylink debate, the state ALP has lied to the local community about its intentions. The member for Pascoe Vale, Kelvin Thomson, the ALP candidate for Essendon, Judy Maddigan, and the member for Coburg, Carlo Carli, all support the widening of the Tullamarine freeway, as would that dill from Werriwa. The reason they only want to talk about tolls is because they do not want to admit that it is ALP policy to widen the freeway. As we all know, freeway widening and public transport just do not mix.

         Most people in the community would acknowledge the fact that police officers are underpaid and overworked. But, in this instance, these are police officers who have retired, who have been overtaxed on their retirement income and who now find themselves in the invidious position where neither the state nor the federal governments will make good repayments for taxation moneys they should never have collected from them and paid to the Commonwealth in the first place. All I can do is implore the Treasurer of the Commonwealth government (Mr Willis) to make good repayment of those overtaxed amounts to retired police officers from Western Australia.

The Labor Party on the weekend unleashed a series of television commercials, launched by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley), designed to scare the living daylights out of the good citizens of Western Australia. The fact that the commercials bear not even a passing resemblance to the truth is beside the point; they are an indicator of just how far Labor will stoop in the forthcoming election.

         In the election of 1993, just days before the poll, people in my electorate of Stirling were sent false Telecom accounts. They looked like the genuine article but had hideously inflated accounts and the misleading statement that a vote for me would lead to ridiculously increased Telecom bills. That, of course, was an outright lie. Labor may have got away with it in 1993, but the people cannot be fooled all the time, and they recognise this latest Labor scam in the west as exactly what it is—lies, lies and more damned lies.

In the time that I have been a minister we have seen about 2 1/2 waves of chief executives, as those who sat behind tariff walls and sat behind regulation all fell over when the system was opened up. The next wave got in and tried to do battle with it, did their best, and were sent to a comfortable never-never. We have now got the ones who have been home grown in the system.

They did not have to sell off the portfolio and crystallise the losses—which they did, at yields of over 10 per cent.

         —When the constitution was written, there were no aeroplanes and there was no television. There was certainly no national economy, because most of the powers resided with the major states of New South Wales and Victoria at the time, up until the Second World War when uniform income taxation came about.

         As a consequence, we have seen since the war the development of an Australian national economy. When the country suffers trend terms of trade problems as we have seen with the decline of our traditional commodity since 1950, there requires a policy reaction—in the 1980s—to change dramatically fiscal policy in this country. Because of uniform taxation, the Commonwealth government of the day, this government, was able to change national fiscal policy. It would not be able to do so were it to be fractured back to the states. If you look at all of the federations which have worked, you see that they have worked when they have had an omnibus taxation power.

         There is this absolutely phoney debate going on—it has gone on for years—amongst conservatives, who in part we funded through some of these little think-tanks, about vertical fiscal imbalance. At its source it means that ministers of the states will be more careful and more wary about spending money if they in fact raise it. That is like saying that, in the Commonwealth cabinet, ministers would pay particular attention to a cabinet submission that was funded off Commonwealth revenue but if it was funded off the deficit they would have a different view of it. Of course, that is a complete and total nonsense.

         This government has resisted giving taxing powers to the states for that reason. We have resisted giving them a share of income tax because when the revenue falls they suffer massive losses. That would have been the case in 1991-92, when I think somewhere of the order of $4 billion to $6 billion—I cannot remember exactly—of that sort of loss would have been occasioned by the fall in income tax, were they to have had a fixed share.

         As the Treasurer pointed out the other day, now that the Commonwealth revenue is rising to cut the deficit and bring it back into surplus, the cost to the Commonwealth would have been an extra $2.8 billion over three years. That is, if in 1995-96 general revenue grants to the states totalled $15.7 billion, or 13.2 per cent of Commonwealth tax revenue, and had the opposition maintained revenue grants, as a Commonwealth, to the states at this share of Commonwealth tax revenues, they would be paying the states an extra $671 million in 1996-97, $708 million in 1997-98 and $1.382 billion in 1998-99.

         In other words, the states will not accept a loss with a big fall in the Commonwealth revenues because they cannot tolerate the loss. That is why we have given them real terms per capita, a real terms increase plus population growth, as a much better alternative than the big sinusoidal effects of losses coming up and then gains coming through the Commonwealth budget which need to be put off the deficit or the surplus. This, though, is not the view of the opposition. The shadow Treasurer said in a statement issued on Friday:

        That was as a smother for the real policy, which is to give them tax powers. Let me take just his admission only. Where anywhere, in anything you have said to date, are you saying that you will cover the $2.8 billion of effects that you are acknowledging are part of your policy? If you are saying that you will give them a fixed share of income tax, have you anywhere said where you will get the $2.8 billion to do it? Or dare we suggest to the press gallery that they ask you? Would it be a shocking thing for them to say, `Mr Costello, you have already admitted that you will give a fixed share of income tax to the states. Where will you find, as the Treasurer indicates, $2.8 billion for the next three years?' Not a bad question.

        The Australian Taxation Office could continue to act as a central tax collection agency, minimising administrative problems.

        This was part of the Greiner proposal of 1991—that the tax office did the dirty work in collecting the state's taxes, but the tax rates and collections were owned by them. So they are a state income tax. Whether the ATO does the collection or not, they are a state income tax. This is what I am talking about when I say that they can have no credibility or honesty in politics without policies. Secret policy development means that they have got the state treasuries in the conservative governments burrowing away, and they have got Mr Cliff Walsh, a former adviser to Mr Fraser, and now Mr Dean Brown burrowing away at it. Their proposal is that, after the election in 1996 in September or October, they will have state income taxes, with the Australian Taxation Office collecting the money.

         Were that to happen, the capacity of running a national economy, of running national fiscal policy, of dealing with the deficit as the surplus, of having One Nation type policies in a recession to bring growth back to a surplus in a long period of growth would no longer be there. When I did my best—and I did well—to spike the 1991 proposal, in their temerity the states said, `Not only will we fix the rates on income tax, but if you, the Commonwealth, want to do another accord deal with tax cuts, you will have to compensate us'—the states—`for the loss of revenue were you to do a wage tax trade-off.' Or, for instance, in the money which the Commonwealth, this government, is going to pay taxpayers for superannuation—the three per cent we are going to pay to them—we would have to compensate the states for the loss of their revenue. Because the Liberal Party has never been a national party, it has always been a collection of state based parties, the tail is still wagging the dog.

         —As a consequence, it is the reason why there was so much interest in this in the OECD and the IMF during the Treasurer's last two visits. I think you heard the Treasurer say that at the IMF World Bank meetings many OECD countries were interested to know how Australia had got to the point where 15 per cent of all incomes will go away voluntarily as part of a national savings and retirement incomes scheme.

         As a result, Australians will have a much higher standard of living in retirement, and there will be a very large pool of national savings. I have formerly given the House the numbers. There will be $1 trillion in national superannuation accounts by the year 2000, and $2 trillion—$2,000 billion—by the year 2020. Even in large countries, even in very large countries, those are very sizeable amounts. But, in a country this large, they are huge amounts.

         Contrast that with the dullards of the opposition and what they were able to do when they were in office. After seven years of government, you are left a modest sum in superannuation accounts with 40 per cent coverage for people in higher incomes or in the Public Service. That was it—about roughly 10 per cent of what is there now.

That is a very slight improvement over the last 50 years. In fact, in 1949 they represented 16 per cent. So it has been very slow progress indeed, and all nations need to lift their game. While the participation of women in decision making positions in the UN has improved ever so slightly, it is not surprising that it has not increased very much, because the countries represented there have not done much better than that. Women constitute only 14 per cent, for instance, of members of the federal parliament.

         I am pleased to be able to remind the House that, on this side of politics at least, we have made significant effort to get more women into parliaments around the country—not just the federal parliament but also the state parliaments. The Labor Party has recognised the problem but, more important than that, it has set up a mechanism to address it.

         I am also pleased to see that at least one member of the New South Wales opposition has also recognised the need for positive action on this front. The New South Wales Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party has recognised, as he puts it, that generations of women have become increasingly alienated by the political process and we—that means both sides of the House—have to do something about that. He suggested in Brisbane on the weekend that the opposition should develop explicit strategies, mechanisms, to install more women in our parliaments—not just to wish it would be so but to actually do it. He said on Sydney radio this morning:

         The Leader of the Opposition is complacent about it—there does not need to be any change. Australian women, including Liberal Party women, are not prepared to wait that long either. I think it is very important that we recognise the need for change. We on this side do, but it seems the Leader of the Opposition is having great difficulty in coming to terms with this concept. He still lives back in the 1950s. He still endorses the views of the Lyons Forum that basically says women should not be out there in the community; they should be at home and they should not be working in this place.

         Comparisons between countries in terms of inequality and the distributive effect of the tax and transfer systems have to take account of the fact that most other countries, particularly in Europe, have social insurance base systems where people make contributions during their working lives towards their retirement incomes. The effect of those sorts of systems is to bring about a very substantial redistribution to the same individuals over the course of their life cycles. If you actually do the analysis properly, it turns out that, in terms of redistribution between people, our system is highly redistributive in comparison to those systems where many of the analyses overstate the degree of redistribution by taking into account that life cycle effect that you get in social insurance systems.

         I would like to refer honourable members to the recent EPAC report on inequality, which actually made use of OECD data to tabulate a number of measures of inequality. One of the most significant was a set of tables that looked at the current situation and trends over time in terms of the ratio of people at the ninth decal point in the income distribution to those at the first decal point—in other words, the ratio of the incomes of those 10 per cent from the top to those 10 per cent from the bottom. On that sort of measure, particularly in comparison with the other English speaking countries, it turns out that Australia has a relatively high equitable income distribution. By comparison with the United States, for example, the degree of inequality is about half here. By comparison with the UK, the degree of inequality is about one-third less. I would like to table a series of graphs which sets that out very clearly and shows very starkly and graphically what the real situation is in terms of equity in this country compared with a number of other comparable countries.

All the policy prescriptions we have heard from the opposition are unambiguously regressive at all points when you can actually get to grips with what they are saying—whether it be taking apart the social safety net to introduce a system of industrial relations, which in all countries in which it has been introduced has had the effect of increasing earnings in equality. The protestations of concern are the usual collection of hypocrisy. I refer honourable members to the series of charts which I have just tabled which show the actual position very clearly.

I ask the Prime Minister: why does he persist with this distortion when the OECD figures on which the EPAC report relies show that in the 12 countries for which an index of earnings is available, during Labor's period in office, the majority of countries actually improved the position of the bottom 10 per cent of workers and reduced earnings inequality, while Australia was one of only three countries that experienced a real cut in the earnings of the lowest paid 10 per cent of workers and increased inequality?

It is headed `Trends in male wage inequality, ratio of decile 9 to decile 1, 1970s to 1990s'. The greatest inequality, of course, is in the United States—right at the top of the chart, which simply confirms what Robert Reich, the US Labor Secretary, had to say. You will remember that I reported his remarks here. He said:

        The great problem in the OECD is that in the United States we have had heaps of employment growth and falling real wages. We have got an army of working poor. On the other hand, the problem in Europe is that we have got high real wages, high growth in real wages and high unemployment. There is nothing, it seems, in between.

        What is in between are the policies of this government and the performance of Australia, which has had high employment growth and, of course, a much lower dispersion between wages growth at the top and wages growth at the bottom.

         This is obvious by the fact that we have had 26 per cent employment growth in this country in just over 10 years.

         When you look at the chart—and Australia is heavily incised here in the black line—in comparative terms we have got a modest change in the dispersion of wages in Australia. Of course, this chart deals with male wage inequality. It does not deal with transfer payments. It does not mention the family allowance supplement or additional family payment. It does not mention the family allowance or Medicare. It does not mention all the other important elements of the social wage—supplementary payments for people at the bottom. It does not mention all of those things. Of course, it does not mention award superannuation.

         —One of the decisions Australia has to make is what sort of society it wants to be in the future—whether it wants to be a society like it is now, where inclusion and equality are important objectives of the national government and of society, or whether you go to a US-style labour market, which has got no safety net, no supports, falling real wages and which, as a consequence, is not improving its productivity to the point where it can grow the US economy at any real speed. As everyone in this House knows, the unofficial speed limit in the United States is 2.5 per cent GDP growth. This country has had, consistently, four per cent. There is all the world of difference between 2.5 per cent and four per cent over a decade in the opportunity and the prosperity which a country enjoys.

         When asked, `Is it true that penalty rates, overtime, superannuation and holiday loadings could all go under Howard?' the shadow spokesperson on industrial relations, Mr Reith, said, `It is just more of Labor's lies'—the paltry, cheap rejoinder. He thinks that is going to be effective in this period coming up, but the fact is that the policies that the coalition would allow, the ones I mentioned, would be lost without compensation. This is true, as we are seeing now in the legislation in Western Australia. Surely he does not deny the legislation, the actual written word, of the policies of the government of Western Australia.

         In the analysis now about the last election result—because stereotypes are always so easily taken up—they say it was all about the GST. It was not about the GST at all. It was about them.

He said, `Put an arm back, and they will drag you down.' It is that cold-heartedness, that mean-spiritedness, that sort of Australia, that cost the coalition the last election.

        Mr Speaker, I am absolutely delighted at this unexpected opportunity—absolutely delighted! I was asked by my colleague the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) whether there was any urgency about a motion which asks the parliament to debate the dishonesty of the government. If ever one wanted some evidence of the urgency of this motion, that evidence has been provided by none other than the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) during question time today. On our reckoning, in his last dorothy dix alone, the Prime Minister enunciated no fewer than nine lies in the answer that he gave.

         This issue goes to the very heart of the debate that is going to rage in Australia between now and the next election, and that is, who do you believe? Do you believe Paul Keating or do you believe John Howard? Far be it from me to personalise this debate—it is not my wont to do that—but if the Prime Minister really wants to make integrity an issue in the next election, if the Prime Minister really wants the Australian people to make a judgment as to who they are going to believe, let me say to the Prime Minister, my Labor opponent, the member for Blaxland, that it sits very easily with those who sit on this side of the House for the next election campaign to be a debate about whether you believe Paul Keating or John Howard. Those who sit on this side of the House have very little doubt as to what the judgment of the Australian people is going to be during the election campaign, if that is the issue.

         This debate gives me a marvellous opportunity to traverse a number of the issues that the Prime Minister touched upon during that extraordinarily dishonest and deceptive answer that he gave before I was asked a question by the member for Warringah. It is very clear that the government have decided on one thing and one thing alone—that is, the only faint hope they have of winning the next election campaign is to run a campaign based on lies and personal abuse. Every single thing they will do between now and polling day will fit very neatly into either of those descriptions. I expected it of the Prime Minister and his colleague, the man we call `the Laurie of lies'—the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton). When it comes to integrity, the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) is battling pretty hard to get into the race. I expected it from them, but I don't know that I expected it from the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley). He has always rather paraded himself as being somebody a little better, but he has been sucked into the vortex of dishonesty. He has been sucked into this pattern of lies and personal abuse.

         The reality is that you only decide to run on a campaign of lies and personal abuse when you don't have anything else to run with. That is the great dilemma that this man, my Labor opponent, faces over the next few months. He cannot run on his record. How can you run on a record when you go to the Australian people saying, `Re-elect us because, cleverly, we have increased the foreign debt by 800 per cent. We tried to make it 1,000 per cent, but we could only make it 800 per cent. Re-elect us because, cleverly, we have increased the cost of servicing the average mortgage in Australia by 50 per cent. We tried to make it 100 per cent, but all we have been able to do since 1983 is lift the figure from $651 a month, on the average loan, to $974 a month. We tried harder and there was a time when we hoped we would say to the Australian people that we could have got it up by 75 per cent, but you'll have to settle for an increase of 50 per cent in the cost.'

         And you wonder why the battlers of Australia think they are being hard pressed at the moment. What my Labor opponent has done over the last 13 years is push up by 50 per cent the cost of servicing the mortgage payments on the average home. That is why so many of you are shaking in your shoes in those marginal seats. That is why we have so much of this false bravado in those 90-second grabs before question time. You are trying to get together and summon up your 3 a.m. courage, to try to pretend that it is all perfectly all right. But you know perfectly well that it is not all right, and you know darned well that those people who have voted for you, year in and year out, want to know why it is that you have let them down so very badly.

         So you cannot run on the management of the foreign debt and you cannot run on keeping mortgage rates down, so perhaps you could run on real wages. You could run on the fact that, in the 13 years you have been in power, real wages have actually fallen. You cannot run on that.

         But I know what you can really run on. The one thing you could perhaps run on is how the gaps between rich and poor in Australia have disappeared while you have been the Prime Minister of this country. In the course of doing that, perhaps you could explain to the Australian people why it is that, in 1976, 65 per cent of all households in Australia had incomes between $22,000 and $72,000. In constant dollar comparisons, by 1992 that figure had fallen, over that 16 years, from 65 per cent to 40 per cent. That would have to represent the greatest decimation of the stabilising middle class in this country that we have seen since European settlement. So I do not think you will be running on the divide between the rich and the poor. So perhaps you could run on integrity.

Only a minute earlier his leader, the Prime Minister, had said that I was going to cut wages. Three minutes after Simon Crean sat down, the Prime Minister was up again saying, `You don't want to elect Howard because he is going to cut wages.'

         The fact is that government members will base their campaign on lies and distortions. They have demonstrated these lies and distortions in relation to our industrial relations policy, with the absolute lie that we would take away sick leave entitlements, the absolute lie that we would take away penalty rates, the absolute lie that we would take away superannuation and the absolute lie that we would cut wages under a Howard government.

         The thing about John Howard is that Australia has passed him by. His defence and foreign policy speech last week could have been given by Harold Holt. It was a disgrace from a modern Australian politician, a disgrace from somebody who wants security from Asia rather than security in Asia. To go back to the United States as some sort of forlorn mendicant with that sort of rhetoric is not the policy you would expect from a modern Australian leader. That was only one thing he dribbled out.

In other words, wherever we have seen him on policy, we have seen either the policies of the 1960s or opportunism, as we have seen with Mascot airport.

Of course, for a government that has been in office for 12 years, the public always wants to see a viable alternative. When Mr Hewson came into the last parliament, there was a strong showing of support for him. It whittled away when people knew what his policies were. In this parliament when Mr Downer came forward, there was a strong showing of support. It vanished very rapidly. Similarly, there has been a strong showing of support for the Leader of the Opposition, and it is now starting to evaporate as people find there is a policy vacuum there and that the country's affairs could not be left in his charge.

They are the things he sees now as the policy prescriptions for the modern Australia. Yet here we are, with a large part of the earth's crust, happy in this large ancient continent bequeathed to us, with this great opportunity in the fastest growing markets of the world, with our chance for our security and our prosperity guaranteed by the thoughtful reactions of the nation and its government.

         Then he says of the government that we have not got any integrity in policy when in fact our most solemn commitment at the last election was to restore the economy to growth and to employment. We have had record growth in employment and record falls in unemployment since we have been keeping the records. We have had job growth of 670,000—the hardest thing of all to put into place. We have had strong employment growth, which is very much in line with the targets we put into the One Nation program in 1991. The first year undershot and all the other years overshot or met their target. Both the tax cuts and the superannuation will pay more than the One Nation commitments. We were responsible for the introduction and payment of the generalised child-care rebate. We created the home child-care allowance and the parenting allowance, both of which have gone into place, and a structure for the republic.

They've introduced the child-care rebate and the home child-care allowance. They did put into place a structured republic.' What have we seen from you? Slipping and sliding on the republic, badmouthing the changes which the government is able to put into place, trying to wreck the ones in 1992 in the Senate, in the budget, and now trying to wreck the privatisation program. Then you go around saying that the government is vilifying the coalition with lies about their industrial relations and taxation policies, which of course we are not.

He failed to mention that we have had the highest rate of growth—or just about; it is shared only with the United States—in the Western world over a decade. But that sort of sleight of hand goes on daily. We have these slipshod, poor and amoral performances by him, and they go on.

It was then attacked by a whole lot of judges and former royal commissioners who say they are abusing the royal commission.

Not one Australian saw those income tax cuts, those l-a-w tax cuts, for one day. They are due to be introduced on 1 January 1996.

Remember when they promised at the last election that they were going to take pensioners out of the income tax system? What happened to that? Are there any pensioners out there still in the income tax system? What happened to that promise? There is another thing I am always amazed about whenever we get up and have these debates about the relative disparity between the rich and the poor: do you remember that by 1990 no child would live in poverty?

This is a government that has been in power so long, has made so many deals and has engaged in so much duplicity that it has forgotten the difference between integrity and honesty with the people and looking after itself. This is a party that now stands for nothing but itself and its mates. This is a party that is prepared to do anything it takes, as one of its former members said. They will say anything and they will do anything because, at the end of the day, all they care about are themselves. All they care about is holding on to power for themselves. All they care about is 13 years of privilege, which they want to maintain for themselves.

         —Every accusation that we have made against this scrofulous frontbench has been based on their own quotes about their own intentions. We have not introduced a single proposition into question time or anywhere else that has not been based on their own quotes about their own intentions. If there is anyone who is concealing anything about their intentions in this place it is the tumbling of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello), as well as his leader, on the taxation stuff.

         Didn't they panic when they saw that come out. Didn't they rush into print to try to get out a few lies, distortions or whatever on covering their tracks—the tracks that he is laying all over this country with the conservative governments. He asks: `Where's the evidence? Where are the quotes?' Let me go through them. He has denied nothing of this. The document says:

        A powerful coalition of state governments of all persuasions and leading business groups is building around work, much of it being done in secret, to develop proposals for reforming vertical fiscal imbalance. Proposals for reforming vertical fiscal imbalance outlined in this include a whole variety of state taxes.

        Okay, we have got that accepted. That is the research that is being done. It is all there. When you talk about vertical fiscal imbalance, you talk about taxation policies. Got that right?

        What is this on? Vertical fiscal imbalance. Related to what? Taxation policy involved in the states. That is what that is based on.

What will be the position of the opposition? Their position is, `We will go into this election with a sleight of hand—a sleight of hand that we hope will not be tumbled; a sleight of hand that includes a hidden GST; a sleight of hand that includes state taxes.' A sleight of hand that is being researched, according to this article, by the conservative governments and by you.

Doesn't this come off the quotes of all of you after the last election? `What was our big mistake on the GST? Not that it was an inequitable hopeless policy and not that it was devastating for the ordinary person in this country. No, we were stupid to do it up-front.'

The implication of what you are saying is that, if we actually quote what John Howard says, by your normal, sensible English translation of what it would mean, we are lying.

He tells us how their policy is being devised, looking at every single criticism that Laurie Brereton might make or that I might make or that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) might make. He says what we all have to say and then devises a policy to deny it. That is their proposition. That is where they are coming from until they get caught out by making statements to the Business Council, which the Premier of Victoria spoke to. Richard Court comes out and says, `I had a chat with John Howard; he has no problems with the policies. I support it.'

We say that it is a model or a template. We say, `Let's discuss these things through with the West Australians and indicate to them that they support it.' We say that Graham Keirath has come out and said that the opposition supports this legislation. We say that he has had conversations with Richard Court and given him these assurances. He says, `You are lying; that is a lie.' We merely may have revealed all of this, but when you say it obviously we would not say that. They say, `You're a liar.' That is a most extraordinary situation—to be called a liar by people who are directly quoting the people whom the opposition is led by, whether they be the deputy leader, the leader, the opposition's industrial relations spokesmen or their various Premiers around the country. We quote them and we are called liars when we are quoting them. It says a hell of a lot for them. It says a hell of a lot for the newspapers that are supposed to be reporting their remarks.

         Is there a bigger liar in Australian politics than the man who went to the last election campaign and said, `I have in my possession the industrial relations legislation'—not the policy proposals—`that I propose to introduce. I am prepared. I have the document. When we come into office'—this is him speaking before the last election—`I will place this bill before parliament. I will have the changes through forthwith.' He has had that bill now for three years. Where is it? This is the man who talks about the highest standards of integrity and probity in politics. That document—that industrial bill—sits in his back pocket. Is this a democracy or not? Are the people entitled to see that or not?

         It is one thing to say that you do not have your policies developed. It is one thing to say that your policies are only a broad, rough indication of what you intend to do. Everybody is in that situation once or twice in politics. It is an inevitable course of the political process. But to have the bill in your pocket for three years—an identifiable and analysable document—and it not appear! This man believes that that behaviour corresponds with the highest standards of integrity in politics. When we draw attention to that we are liars. When we draw attention to that we are fearmongers. When we draw attention to that we are trying to skate back into office on the backs of misleading and inaccurate portrayals of our political opponents. That is absolutely absurd.

         The Leader of the Opposition had a lot else to say during his 20 minutes. He had to do a fair bit to fill in. I am going to go through one or two items of his speech. He said that this government is the government which has produced outstandingly high rates of youth unemployment. This standard of honesty apparently accords with the following figures. When he was in office there were 155,000 young people seeking full-time work in this country. There are now 88,000. Is that a lie? Is that presenting a truthful picture of the contemporary situation?

         Then the Leader of the Opposition went on and said—on our policies on interest rates in relation to the housing sector—that it is 50 per cent more expensive to service a mortgage now than when they were in office. The mortgage rate now is 10.5 per cent. That is if you are doing badly. If you go to one of the new superannuation backed outfits, you can get 9.4 per cent. If you go to one or two of the banks who are prepared to do smart deals, you can get 10 per cent or less. What was it when we came into office? It was 13 per cent. It never fell in that entire time that he was Treasurer, for that last term, below the level that it is now. That level was put in place to produce a sensible slowing of the economy. What did they used to do then? They used to cocktail them up.

        That was the position that applied before we got into office. Then he goes on and talks about Medicare. He opposed Medicare legislation put into this place twice—once during Whitlam's time and once under our time. Since that time on four or five separate occasions when the election has been around the place he has put forward the proposition that Medicare should be done over and pulled apart. He now says that he supports Medicare and he takes umbrage when we suggest that people perhaps ought not to believe him. They might actually be a bit suspicious about that. This is a man who is making an art form of lies in this election campaign—lies about where they stood, lies about where they now stand and lies about what their intentions are. Neither the Leader of the Opposition, nor the deputy who seconded the motion, who has been putting forward lies about his intentions on state policies, has the moral authority to move this motion.

          —Last Wednesday, the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) asked me about the acoustics in the chamber galleries. Concerns have been expressed about the acoustics in the Senate and the House of Representatives public galleries for some time. A working group of officials was appointed to consider measures to improve the system. Following their report, changes were made to the chamber acoustics. Members may recall that this resulted in changes to both the microphones and the speakers. This took place in August 1992.

          A proposal to upgrade the acoustics in the public galleries was postponed because of the cost, estimated at $530,000. The need to upgrade the acoustics in the public galleries has now been identified as a critical project and I expect to consider it as part of the 1996-97 capital works program shortly.

       The Convention came into force in 1983 and has been ratified by 41 countries. This is the first opportunity—and the last for at least another 10 years—to review its workings. It is clear that for all its good intentions, the Conventions has had little impact on restricting the use of deadly weapons it set out to regulate in 1983, particularly landmines. Mines are now proliferating so fast that there are perhaps as many as 100 million of them in 62 countries. Scattered like deadly seeds, they have turned whole swaths of many countries into deserted, no-go areas.

       The petition of certain citizens of the State of New South Wales draws to the attention of the House the adverse consequences of a decision by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to close Adult Migrant English classes in Auburn New South Wales and to require the Adult Migrant English Service (AMES) to transfer these classes to Parramatta.

       This action presents obstacles to attendance at English classes. It would impose a need to travel on many migrants and refugees in their early stages of settlement. Many lack the confidence, language skills and money to do so. It would create difficulties for parents caring for young children. Some would not be able to overcome these obstacles and would forfeit their entitlement to classes.

Separations, divorces and dissolutions recognise that partnerships do not always work and a system is in place for orderly and just break-ups. The same right must exist for unions which feel that the amalgamation, a contractual arrangement, has not been respected or successful.

         —Today I wish to raise the issue of taxation fraud within the computer industry. The fact of this fraud has been drawn to my attention by a constituent of mine who is a major retailer of computer equipment and who, over the past two years, has worked tirelessly to expose the fraud being perpetrated. On top of the myriad of pressures facing small business today, including excessive paperwork and high taxation, and taxation which involves very high compliance costs, computer retailers have an added pressure—some of their competitors are undercutting them by taxation fraud.

         Some officials of the Australian Taxation Office have estimated that this fraud could be costing the Taxation Office as much as $140 million a year. However, there are legitimate operators who think the figure may go as high as $1 billion in lost revenue. Other Taxation Office officials do not feel that they have sufficient information to make an accurate estimate of the extent of the cost to revenue of this fraud.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         There are two distinct aspects of this fraud: the non-payment of taxation due, and the claiming of a rebate for wholesale sales tax which has not been paid. The first scam involves a company purchasing computers and computer equipment, such as printers, from wholesalers and claiming exemption of wholesale sales tax because they are selling directly to a retailer. The company then offers the computer or computer equipment for sale to a retailer or consumer at a particularly good price, claiming that tax has been paid. The invoice issued by the company includes a declaration that wholesale sales tax has been paid, but the Australian Taxation Office misses out on the revenue.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Given that wholesale sales tax on computers and computer  equipment is currently at 22 per cent, the price difference between a computer on which wholesale sales tax has been paid and one on which it has not been paid is substantial. This is what is hurting the legitimate businesses and, ultimately, the wider community. It is hard to compete with someone who is offering an identical product at a very substantial and illegally obtained discount.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The second stage of the fraud occurs when the computer or computer equipment has been sold to customers who have an exemption from wholesale sales tax, such as farmers, churches and schools. The operator acting illegitimately then claims and receives a rebate on the wholesale sales tax from the tax office, even though tax was not paid in the first place. Currently, it appears that this problem is predominantly a Victorian one, but there is evidence of the fraud spreading interstate, particularly to New South Wales. The Australian Taxation Office was advised by computer retailers in Victoria of this problem almost two years ago, but retailers still feel that not enough is being done to protect legitimate businesses and prosecute the fraudulent ones.

         I am personally not satisfied that sufficient effective steps have been taken by the government to stop this fraud and to bring the offenders to justice. There has been considerable correspondence with the Treasurer, Mr Willis, the Assistant Treasurer, Mr Gear, and the Commissioner for Taxation over the past 18 months. On 27 May, Mr Gear claimed:

        However, it has been reported to me that the tax office told my constituent that it is beyond them `to police the fraud under current sales tax regulations'.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Both cannot be right, and the reported comment from the tax office to my constituent clearly contradicts the assurances given by the Assistant Treasurer that the necessary action was already being taken to ensure that the correct amount of sales tax was paid. The government must clarify this matter. If there is a need for further legislative action, then this should be clearly identified and action should be taken. If there is not, then it is up to the government to explain why the prosecution of this fraud is taking such a long period of time.

         Legitimate operators have suggested that one needs only to pick up the classifieds section of any newspaper to find evidence of the fraud taking place. Such evidence includes computers and computer equipment being sold for less than the dealer cost plus the 22 per cent wholesale sales tax. It is quite impossible for legitimate businesses to compete on these terms, and there is a great deal of anxiety amongst the legitimate computer retailers that they are being undercut in this way for a very extended period of time in a way which is damaging to their business.

         As I stated earlier, the tax office was first advised of this tax avoidance by various legitimate retailers two years ago, and it has taken some steps to act on the fraud. But legitimate retailers are wondering how long they have to continue competing against illegal operators. Some of the steps taken by the tax office include both top-down and bottom-up audits of the distribution chain. A bottom-up audit starts at the retail end of the chain, identifies those companies selling at the lowest prices and then traces back to their supplier. The tax office is also using the classified advertisements in newspapers to identify and then visit certain retailers as part of its bottom-up audit process.

         The tax office, I understand, is also monitoring all new applications of business registrations which refer to the computer industry instead of just a sample, which is common practice, and it is monitoring refund claims. Any application for registration that refers to the computer industry is checked to ensure that the person applying is actually a legitimate person from a legitimate address.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I understand that, in the last six months in Victoria, this process has identified between 20 and 30 applications which do not meet the criteria and which have been refused. The tax office is also refusing refunds if it suspects that wholesale sales tax has not been paid. On top of bogus refund claims in Victoria, the tax office has also identified shonky refund claims in New South Wales.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The second part of the tax office's strategy to combat the fraud is an education campaign aimed at educating the industry participants in their responsibilities. This campaign is designed to inform newly registered businesses of their responsibilities with regard to wholesale sales tax and rebates. It is based on the idea of industry self-regulation. However, the legitimate operators justly claim that the problem with tax avoidance and fraud is not a lack of knowledge amongst industry participants about their obligations. Some know their obligations full well, but the illegal operators make a conscious decision to flout the law.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         As part of industry self-regulation, the tax office wants the large importers to ensure that their goods are sold only to legitimate operators. This aim may be somewhat naive as the importers are not necessarily in a position to identify legitimate operators and they cannot be held responsible for their products all the way down the distribution chain.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The tax office also wants the legitimate businesses to educate the public about the tax avoidance issue, although customers are not inconvenienced by purchasing equipment on which wholesale sales tax has not been paid—in fact, they benefit from a lower price. It is being rather gullible to believe that people will happily pay a higher price for goods just so the tax office does not miss out on revenue, or that they will necessarily consider the legitimate operator who is abiding by the law and therefore has a more expensive product.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         By far the best way to ensure that legitimate operators are not bankrupted by unfair competition from illegal operators is to stop the illegal operators. This process has been unduly long. In Victoria, three cases have been referred to the Australian Federal Police under the Crimes Act; about 10 cases have been or are being prosecuted under the Taxation Administration Act; between 40 and 50 cases are being pursued through the courts in relation to wholesale sales tax and income tax returns; and multiple assessments have been issued which have resulted in debt collection activity in more than 70 cases.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The tax office obviously has identified that fraud in the computer retailing industry is a problem which needs to be addressed and it would certainly be distorting the situation to say that no action has been taken. However, the legitimate operators in the industry do not feel that enough is being done, and anything that is being done is taking an extraordinarily long time. The government has also given assurances that have not been borne out in this matter. Legitimate businesses have been competing against illegal operators for at least two years and are struggling to keep their businesses afloat in an unfavourable environment. The tax office must act and must be seen to be acting swiftly and competently to prevent fraud in the computer industry and to prosecute those who perpetrate fraud.

          It is important to put on record in the House the fact that residents of western Sydney demand, just as vigorously as residents in any other part of Australia would, that there be the most comprehensive environmental study and analysis process in regard to all the operational aspects of Badgerys Creek airport. Residents of western Sydney—in particular, the residents I speak for in the Parramatta electorate—do not accept the sort of proposition that the Leader of the Opposition and member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has portrayed as the opposition's approach to what needs to be done to solve a small interest that he might have in his own constituency.

He says that the additional funding does not ensure that Badgerys Creek will proceed without haste, and has numerous other comments on the record in that regard.

It is clear that much can be learnt from both the environmental impact process followed in respect of Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport's new parallel runway and the new noise analysis approach.

          With respect to the Badgerys Creek airport, the key thing that residents are quite rightly saying is that they are not convinced, on the basis of the 1985 study, that all of the issues to do with air, water, noise, flight path planning—all of those aspects—have been properly addressed. We must take account of all the noise analysis work, all of the experience of airports here and around the world, the impact of changing aircraft design and the potential that has to change some of the strategies that were part of the study process, and the variables included in the study process for the original EIS on Badgerys Creek in 1985.

          It is absolutely critical, as residents are rightly saying, that those studies be comprehensive and that we go through a process of analysing all the new data and all the new material available to ensure that we have a strategic approach to the aviation needs of Sydney which will not only meet the aviation demands of the Sydney region over the next 50 years but will also satisfy the legitimate concerns of residents throughout the whole Sydney region.

          In the past, all too often, governments have not taken enough account of the environmental concerns of western Sydney. We have had a series of developments there which have not had the planning they should have had. It is particularly regrettable to note, since the original decision was made in 1985 that Badgerys Creek would be the site of the second Sydney airport, that there has been a deal of planning and development that should not have been allowed to occur in such proximity to the airport as to exacerbate the problems that may occur as a result of the airport. The conflict between development and airport operation could have been avoided had we had a state government in the latter part of the 1980s that was strongly committed to preventing that unwanted development, and had we had that state government using its planning powers, in conjunction with local government, to ensure land was not released for inappropriate activity over the last seven to 10 years.

          What we now need to do is ensure that Badgerys Creek airport is designed in a way that will make sure all of the operational aspects of airport development provide the absolute minimum of adverse impact on the community and on the environment of the region. The fact is that numerous studies undertaken by the CSIRO and others point to the substantial air pollution problem that occurs in that part of the Sydney region. As you move out towards that point, before you go to the Blue Mountains in Sydney, there is the great capacity there for much of the wind movement to generate extensive pollution across western Sydney. It can sit there for days just building up and becoming a substantial problem.

          How you fit that into the problems relating to overall aviation demand is something again. It is a major challenge. What it needs is to take a step back and say, `These are very fundamental issues in 1995 that the community of western Sydney wants answers to.' They want to ensure that the inadequate planning processes of the past are not revisited on them. It is incumbent upon all of us in this parliament to say, `We will give those residents that commitment and that reassurance.'

          The Leader of the Opposition says he believes that Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport should be closed to international traffic and that all international traffic should be diverted to Badgerys Creek. That is quite contrary to what was talked about in the 1985 EIS process and is inappropriate regarding the announcements made about Badgerys Creek and what role it will play in aviation in the Sydney region in terms of meeting Australian aviation requirements into the future.

          Briefly, I want to raise one other matter. A constituent of mine has raised with me on a number of occasions the need to ensure that the million people in Australia who are deaf or have hearing impairment get access to captioning on news programs, particularly through the national news services on the ABC. The fact that there are a million people who have such a requirement is one that I think the nation should see as a reason to give this issue priority. I take the opportunity to urge the government to take steps to recognise that this is an important community service that should be provided, at not significant cost, in a way that gives quality of life to many people who have a hearing impairment but are seeking not a great deal from us other than the fact that they be able to see the national news service in the same way as everyone else does and get appropriate benefit from it.

          —On 26 July this year, my office was raided by officers of the Australian Federal Police. There has been ample publicity about the raid, so I do not intend to go into the details or circumstances of the raid in great detail, but I would like to put on record some matters about the raid which I feel need to be made. First and foremost, I would like to put it on the record that I and my staff have been cleared of all the allegations made against us. I knew all along that we would be cleared, for we did nothing wrong. The search warrant which prompted the raid on our office alleged certain conduct which neither I nor my staff were involved in. I am proud to say that the police have declared that my office—I and my staff—are totally innocent, as I knew would be the case. We played no part whatsoever in the alleged offences detailed in the search warrant.

          The reason I put this on the record is that on the day of the raid, and days following, it was reported in the media that my office had been raided and that I and my staff were the subject of police interviews. My Labor opponent in the seat of Stirling even took out a full-page advertisement which included headlines such as `Cameron in police interview'. I honestly thought that she would have remembered the tenet that one is innocent until proven guilty rather than trying to sneakily give the impression of our being guilty of something we were not involved in. Despite our innocence, the implications were there and hurt us dearly. It was made worse when we were used by my opponent for cheap, nasty political point scoring.

          Over the course of these events, I read 27 reports—including front-page newspaper stories and virtual full-page stories—mentioning the raid on my office, not to mention the countless television and radio reports about it. When the Federal Police announced we were cleared, how much publicity was there? There was one story I read in the

I am still having people calling my office asking what the results of the raid were, whether we have been cleared and so on. So, for the record, we have been cleared. The news certainly is not as interesting for the media when people have done nothing wrong and are cleared as when they have been raided or arrested. While I am utterly delighted we have been cleared, the adverse media publicity did hurt, and it was a very stressful time for me, my staff and our families.

          Following the raid on my office, I sought legal assistance for me and my staff so we could get on with our jobs without being interfered with too much by the police inquiries. Our lawyer also, of course, was required to sit in during interviews for guidance. Today, I and my staff are paying off a bill totalling over $5,000 as a result of the raid. Approximately $3,500 was for counsel over the raid itself, and another $1,500 was spent on legal representations where I lodged a criminal defamation complaint to the Western Australian Police Force about comments by another person about the circumstances surrounding the raid, but which unfortunately was not further investigated, and which I did not further pursue because of the costs involved.

          I am lucky to have a generous lawyer who is allowing me to pay off the bill over time. Members would know that on our incomes we are lucky that we can survive comfortably, even with disruptions such as this. However, there are many people in the community who are not able to qualify for legal aid but also find it a struggle to afford legal representation when required, and this seriously compromises their ability to access justice.

          Access to justice does appear to be a contradiction in terms. For example, in the 1994-95 financial year, there were 5,500 unsuccessful applications for legal aid in Western Australia, of which 3,200 satisfied the tests under current guidelines relating to income and assets, the merits of their cases and the type of case. A number of those people have passed through my office, seeking assistance, and to my absolute regret many were not successful in receiving the legal aid they sought.

          With limited funds, it is inevitable that funds can only go to the most worthy cases, even though those cases that are denied funding are still very worthy. Despite the best intentions of all governments, there will always be those who cannot afford legal assistance but are ineligible for legal aid and, as such, will be deprived of justice or have difficulty accessing it. Those who cannot access the legal representation they desire or require will be compromised by these limitations in their pursuit of justice or the defence of their innocence.

They neither have access to legal aid, nor earn the salaries of higher income earners to afford the representation they desire. It is the same in this area, as it is in many other forums of government, that this group is forgotten or ignored. They must be considered at all times in this regard and it is something parties of all political persuasions must continue to look at if we are to achieve our goal of a fair and just society.

          I would like to think that the raid has been positive in one respect. It gave me the opportunity to view the working conditions of our federal law enforcement officers and, quite frankly, they are appalling. We are expecting these officers to chase the Mr Bigs of the criminal world, we are expecting them to catch the drug lords who are destroying the lives of so many young people, but the resources with which they must operate and the conditions for them to work under are utterly appalling. At the interview my staff were put in a room to wait. The room held a desk and a computer. The computer was ancient and the desk was tatty. This is the sort of equipment we are expecting our law enforcement officers to work with—and this is but one of many examples.

          Just recently we had a newspaper story stating that the Western Division—the Western Australian section of the Australian Federal Police—could not even afford to pay their rent. The officers of the AFP cannot be paid overtime so are only able to work between the hours of 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. I could not be interviewed on one occasion because I was only available to them after 4 p.m. and they could not claim overtime. When you consider the criminals they must chase, this is appalling. How many criminals work between those hours? They don't, and we cannot expect the Federal Police to operate only between those hours either.

          The Australian Federal Police, certainly in Western Australia, need a major injection of funds or the fight against crime will not be won. We will be a laughing stock of the criminals, if the funds which the police are given to fight crime is just a pittance of the funds invested in crime by the people they are chasing. I appeal to the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) to visit the Western Division of the AFP and view their working conditions, and to give serious consideration to giving them an increase in funding. If no action is taken, the minister will be derelict in his duty of providing the resources to fight the criminals and protect the community from these maggots of society.

          We have huge sums of money spent on politicians, our offices and resources, but there is a more important group deserving of more funding; that is, our law enforcement officers. It is time the government gave them the resources they require. If they do not, they will be neglecting the responsibility of providing for one of society's most basic needs, that of safety. I implore the minister to review the funding to the Australian Federal Police because a failure to increase funding will simply see more kids' lives destroyed by these criminals. It is the duty of us all to work to ensure that funding is increased and that the perpetrators of crime are fought, and beaten, with adequate resources.

          Turning to a somewhat brighter matter, I have been fortunate enough over the past few months to have had working in my office here in Canberra another intern from the Australian national internships program. The young lady I have had working with me on this occasion is a young woman by the name of Helen Geard, from Tasmania. She has presented me with a report on family conferencing in Australia with the rather creative title
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         There are many underlying and complex factors contributing to the level of juvenile crime in Australia. Innovative strategies are required to address juvenile crime issues and the focus of this report is one such innovation—family conferencing.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Family conferencing gives young offenders and victims the opportunity, in a supportive environment, to discuss important issues about an offence which has been committed. Conference participants aim to reach a consensus about a suitable course of action.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The core process of family conferencing is similar across Australia, however, there are significant variations. Variations include; the term used to describe the process, where family conferencing is placed in the juvenile justice hierarchy and which organisation is responsible for its co-ordination.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         It is too early to determine what is the most appropriate means of implementing family conferencing so innovation must be allowed to continue. Innovation requires commitment to discussion, implementation and evaluation from all stakeholders in family conferencing.
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The report identifies two barriers to the continued success of family conferencing in Australia. The first barrier is the existing fragmented approach to the collection of data on juvenile crime. A comprehensive and integrated data collection strategy is required to assist in evaluating family conferences and the development of public policy. The second barrier is an apparent lack of communication between stakeholders across Australia preventing constructive dialogue and innovation.
        </para>

         An important first step in addressing the many issues, highlighted in this report, would be to hold a national conference on family conferencing.

         The Volker commission in the United States argued last year that the swings in foreign exchange markets since floating was introduced has been a contributing cause to the low growth rates in industrialised countries during the last couple of decades. The apparent recent misalignment of major currencies appears to be a significant factor in the slowness of economic recovery in some countries. That is very clear at present in Japan.

         The theory of rational speculative bubbles has increased understanding of this process; that is, the theory that market operators will go on acting as if currencies will go on rising or falling, whether or not that is justified by fundamentals. The constant smaller fluctuations of exchange rate add to risk and cost for business. The variability of financial flows increases the difficulty of monetary management, particularly in thin, emerging markets, and swings of confidence can cause massive movements of capital and exchange rates with  enormously damaging economic and social consequences, as Mexico so vividly demonstrated in the six months since last December. The collapse of Barings Bank adds to concern about the effectiveness of internal corporate and market supervision.

         These and related concerns have caused increased interest in means of reducing international financial market volatility and risk. A return to fixed exchange rates seems fanciful in foreseeable circumstances except on a regional basis, as in the European Union and perhaps, at some point in the future, between Australia and New Zealand. Proposals for macro-economic coordination between the G3—the US, Germany and Japan—with the aim of constraining currency movements to target zones would involve a degree of cooperation which none of the major countries is interested in at present. This has led to some growth of interest in the possibility of a small levy on foreign exchange transactions, as proposed by the Nobel laureate in economics, James Tobin.

         Professor Peter Kenen proposed at a conference on the Tobin tax a few weeks ago what he described as a feasible plan for a small levy on foreign exchange transactions. An ad valorem tax would apply on the value of the transaction at a fixed rate and could be applied to all transactions—swap, futures and forward, as well as spot transactions—by banks and other dealers in the foreign exchange markets. Avoidance would be minimised by imposing a penalty tax rate to dealings with parties based in tax-free jurisdictions. So if someone was in the Cayman Islands, a penalty rate of, say, five times the tax rate could be charged on funds transferred from the Cayman Islands.

         Keeping the rate low would enhance viability. Kenen suggested a rate of 0.05 per cent. Discussion at the same conference tended towards a rate of 0.1 per cent. That is about double the current transaction cost. The tax would be collected at dealing sites because these sites are less readily moveable than settlement or booking sites. Dealing sites involve employees and dealing rooms. The tax would be collected by governments on a market basis.

         Such a levy would generate considerable revenue for national governments and for the provision of global public goods. The Bank for International Settlements is in the process of gathering up-to-date data, but figures released by  the major markets suggest that the daily global turnover—that is, the turnover every day—now averages around $US1,300 billion. On the basis of plausible assumptions that a tax of 0.1 per cent would reduce the volume of transactions by about 20 per cent, Professor Jeffrey Frankel estimates that the tax would raise a total of about $US176 billion a year.

         The major recipients would be the countries in which the volume of financial transactions is greater, which are, in descending order: the UK, which accounts for nearly a third of global transactions; the US; Japan; Singapore; Switzerland; Hong Kong; Germany; France; and Australia. We are ninth in this ordering of markets in which the most financial transactions occur. For other countries, the tax would be a valuable additional source of revenue, as it would be for all of those nine countries, including Australia. International agreement would be essential on the rate, the administration of the tax, and the extent to which revenue would be shared internationally.

         The rationale for international revenue raising is now very strong. With growing globalisation, an increasing number of issues must be addressed, in part at least, on a global basis—issues such as reducing pollution, containing the spread of disease, peacekeeping, development cooperation, disaster relief and drug control, just to give some clear examples.

         As well as the reduction of market volatility and risk, all require a degree of international cooperation. Yet all remain inadequately addressed because of a combination of the free rider problem and the prisoners dilemma. Some of the solutions for these issues require the provision of international public goods. Public goods are services from which all benefit, whether or not they contribute to their cost. Examples of global public goods are: the prevention of war or terrorism; prevention of enlargement of the hole in the ozone layer; international postal, telecommunications and civil aviation organisational infrastructure; and international financial stability.

         Although all people have an interest in these goods, they remain underprovided because everyone waits for everyone else to act, hoping for a free ride. While this interest is rational for each individual and country, all end up being worse off because of inaction which exacerbates the problems, which is the prisoners' dilemma. Compulsory comprehensive revenue collection to pay for global common goods is an essential way of coping with this form of market failure internationally as well as nationally. That is why we have national tax systems.

         The most relevant way in which a portion of the revenue from a Tobin tax could be used would be to improve the functioning of capital markets. Some of such activity is already under way: the work of the IMP to increase the accuracy and transparency of national economic and social data; the proposed doubling of the general arrangements to borrow, including by drawing in additional countries including Australia, which was discussed at the IMF meeting about two weeks ago in Washington; the proposal to establish currency stabilisation funds in developing countries and economies in transition, which is another IMF proposal which is on the table for discussion; the work of the Basle Committee and the Bank for International Settlements to recommend ways of improving prudential supervision. They are all the kinds of activities which could appropriately be paid for by the revenue from a Tobin tax.

The World Bank is planning more technical assistance to developing countries, wanting to increase the efficiency and sophistication of their financial markets. All of these activities, and others related to them, would be entirely suitable uses for revenue from a Tobin tax, so too would broader activities aimed at strengthening international development.

         The best functioning capital markets are worth little if the rest of the economy and society are in disarray. There are other important purposes that would be served by the tax, reducing the volume of international financial flows and reducing short-term speculation. As well as that, it is important to note that many countries are beginning to show an interest in this proposal and that study of it is under way. I am glad to say that our foreign minister is one of those who are supporting study of the idea. That study is an essential prelude to negotiations between countries which would be a necessary condition for the introduction of such a tax.

         In Australia there is currently widespread interest in treaties, how they are made and the obligations they create. By entering into a treaty, Australia undertakes internationally that it will enact any domestic legislation necessary to implement the treaty. Treaties plainly have significant consequences therefore for legislatures.

         Notwithstanding that consequence, Australia's entry into treaties does not involve the Australian parliament. The constitutional power to enter into treaties is virtually without qualification vested in the executive, meaning in effect the cabinet. Recently, control of the treaty making processes appears to have been steadily passing from the cabinet, the elected government, to the bureaucracy—cabinet considering only a portion of the treaties to which the executive commits Australia.

         The executive has no formal obligation to consult this parliament in relation to any treaty to which it proposes to commit Australia. Similarly, the executive has no formal obligation to consult state or territory governments or any person likely to be affected by implementation of the proposed treaty. There is a need for consultation by the executive arm of the federal government with the state and territory governments and interest groups and there is a need for the involvement of the parliament in order to achieve wider consultation and to make the executive more accountable. In recent months an increasing body of public opinion has called for more consultation, more accountability and a proper role for the parliament.

         Among proposals made by the coalition for institutional reform of the treaty making processes is a proposal to establish a joint house treaties committee in the parliament. Under a coalition government, this would be set up by resolutions of the two houses. It would be made up of senators and members and would be serviced by a permanent secretariat. The membership of the committee would be drawn from government, opposition and minor parties. As with many parliamentary committees, the chair would normally be of the government party and the deputy chair would usually be from the opposition.

         It would not be feasible for the committee to monitor extended international negotiations of prospective conventions or to review a series of drafts of conventions produced at different negotiation phases. The best use of a parliamentary treaties committee would be for reviewing a proposed treaty only once, at a relatively late stage in its development either immediately prior to the anticipated signature or after signature and before ratification. The principal issue for the committee would be whether it would be in Australia's interest that the treaty be signed or ratified, as the case may be.

         Unless narrower terms of reference were agreed, the committee would seek to analyse the implications for Australia of adhering to a proposed convention. Submissions could be sought and obtained from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, from any line department involved in the subject matter of the treaty, from state and territory governments and from the public. In most cases the committee would take evidence in public hearings.

Such a committee should be free, of its own motion, to inquire into any prospective treaty to which it is anticipated Australia will become a party.

         Australia becomes a party to scores of treaties each year. The proposed joint house committee could not conduct full public inquiries into all of them or even a small proportion of them. It is likely in fact that there would be little or no interest among members of the committee and other senators and members in reviewing most proposed treaties. Many treaties have bipartisan support. The committee's secretariat, however, would be able to do a brief preliminary analysis of each proposed convention for the purpose of recommending to the committee whether a more detailed inquiry was desirable.

         If, however, the recommendations run counter to the directions taken by Australian representatives in negotiations, it is certainly possible that there could be some embarrassment in international forums. But, given the importance of effective consultation and accountability, that is a price that should be paid. It is certainly preferable to the existing system under this government of five-minute speeches upon the tabling of batches of treaties, some of which are already in force, or the even more ridiculous secret tabling under the `deemed presentation' provisions of the standing orders of this House. In any event, if they knew in advance that any proposed treaty negotiated for Australia would be subject to parliamentary committee review, the negotiators would be in a position to minimise any potential embarrassment.

         This is just one of the coalition's proposals for reform of the treaty making process, but a parliamentary treaties committee alone would go a long way towards ensuring that the people of Australia have a say in the sorts of international obligations that are to bind them. This would eliminate the charade that took place in the Senate last Wednesday, the simultaneous secret tabling in this House, and would improve the quality of the democracy in which we live. A Howard coalition government would not take the arrogant, non-accountable approach taken by the Keating Labor government.

         In 1992 in Victoria Jeffrey Kennett went to the polls saying, `No Victorian will be worse off. Not one Victorian will suffer because I will not do anything which will hurt Victorian families.' That is what he said. Like the opposition in this place, he also had no policies. But he kept running on dead, of course. He kept pointing out to Victorians—the guilty party—that Victoria was in a parlous state because the Labor government had raised this enormous amount of debt. He, Jeffrey Kennett, and the conservatives in Victoria would bring Victoria into a much better state; we would have economic goodness and happiness, and all Victorians could smile ever after. It was a lie. It was a deceitful, deliberate lie. Victorians now pay an enormous price because of that lie and that deceit.

Secondly, if you are still alive, you will be picked up and taken to a hospital. Recently, in the case of a three-year-old boy at Mornington, the emergency centre was locked and the doctors could not get a key to open it. That lad died.

Three hundred schools have been closed. I did not hear the honourable member bleat once, and he says that he represents rural Victoria. He did not bleat once when 300 schools vanished off the face of rural parts of Victoria. In all rural towns public servants are getting the boot—over 80,000 of them.

        The purpose of this is to introduce amendments to the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 and the Export Control Act 1982. The amendments to the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993 will provide for the continuation of AWRAP's chemical residue monitoring and education programs which were to cease at the end of 1995. These activities will now be specific functions of AWRAP, although AWRAP will have no regulatory powers in this regard.

         Under the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993, these activities were to be divested to industry before the end of 1995. However, the wool industry has been unable to identify a more effective and efficient means of undertaking residue monitoring and education programs than currently exists through AWRAP. Given the growing sensitivities in world markets to chemical residues, these amendments will allow the responsibility for the activities of residue monitoring and conducting of related education programs to remain with AWRAP.

         There are three amendments to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967. The first of these reflects the government's commitment to ensuring that the rights of indigenous Australians are protected. To that end, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 will be amended to ensure that persons conducting offshore petroleum operations under that act will be required to respect and not unduly interfere with native title rights and interests when conducting those operations. This amendment provides an explicit legislative basis for the protection of native title rights and places these on a level footing with marine interests, such as navigation, fishing and conservation.

         The second proposed amendment to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 takes account of government responsibilities in regard to industrial health and safety. The offshore petroleum industry has an excellent safety record, despite being involved in potentially hazardous activities. The risks involved and the need for a sharp focus on safety was brought to light in 1988 when an explosion and fire on the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         The lessons learned from that disaster have resulted in a new regulatory approach to petroleum safety in offshore Australia involving a move to objective based regulation. This provides companies and employees with the flexibility to manage safety in a way which best suits their specific circumstances. Such an approach recognises that managerial commitment and work system controls are crucial to safe operations.

         This amendment strengthens the ability to make safety regulations under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967. In particular, it places a management focus on safety by specifically allowing for the making of regulations to ensure companies maintain management systems to secure the health and safety of personnel. The amendment also contains amendments to the act to remove an ambiguity to ensure that, where state or Northern Territory occupational health and safety legislation applies, the provisions contained in schedule 7 of the act do not apply.

         The third amendment deals with a revised system of awarding offshore petroleum exploration permits under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967, known as the guaranteed work program bidding system which was introduced almost 10 years ago by the government. A review of the system has revealed that the current provisions of the act are not adequate to fully support it.

         The amendments proposed are designed to give legal force to the system to ensure that it is fully effective and adequately protects the rights of explorers. The guaranteed work program bidding system was introduced to enable soundly based work programs to be submitted and to avoid applicants overbidding for exploration permits and, if successful, not being able to fulfil their commitments. Over the past 10 years, the system has worked well and bidding rounds have been characterised by strong but realistic work program bids.

         Under the system, successful applicants are required to meet the work program for which they bid for the first three years of the term of the exploration permit—that is, the guaranteed component. If they elect to continue beyond the first three years, they must meet the work program in each of the three remaining years of the initial permit term. There is an option to surrender the permit on completion of the work in each of the last three years.

         The proposed amendment to the Export Control Act 1982 deals with the government announcement in the budget that a dedicated and independent monitoring unit would be established within the Department of Primary Industries and Energy to implement new monitoring arrangements to monitor compliance with hardwood woodchip licence conditions. The costs of the monitoring arrangements are to be recovered from licensed hardwood woodchip exporters.

         —I wish to address those parts of the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 relating to the proposed amendments to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967. The guaranteed work program bidding system for offshore petroleum exploration is an orderly bidding process which allows companies to bid for the right to explore for petroleum in specific areas or for permits in the offshore areas under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth.

         These permit areas are released by the federal government for bidding, when geophysical and other studies have indicated the possibility of petroleum being found in that area. Companies then submit bids, based on the nature of the exploration they wish to undertake and the amount they expect to spend. These bids are assessed by the federal government, and the right to explore in the permit area is then awarded to the bid which best agrees with the established criteria.

         This system has been widely supported by state and territory government and the industry at large for the 10 years of its operation. However, as the House has been advised by the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall), a loophole has been discovered which potentially allows holders of exploration permits to surrender their permits at any time, without having completed their bid.

         Unlike the more predictable activity associated with workplaces such as machine shops, petroleum exploration involves bursts of activity which require comprehensive safety planning and debriefing. Given the dangerous nature of the work, it is a tribute to all those involved that we have seen a significant improvement in safety in the petroleum industry over the last few years. From a level of 8.9 in 1990, lost time injury frequency rates for the industry have fallen to a creditable 5.8 in 1994. This compares very favourably with the total mining figure in the year 1993-94 of 27.

         One worrying element in regard to safety issues in offshore operations is the extent to which restrictive industrial relations practices are hampering the development of a safety culture. At present, the operator of a vessel has no say in the choice of crew since crews are selected using a roster established by the union. With different personnel for each trip, experience in safe operation under petroleum exploration conditions is not being accumulated. There is a break in the continuity of those in the workplace. Without the ability to retain and encourage good performers, safety issues are much harder to address effectively. These restrictive practices have no place in an industry which has to be internationally competitive to survive.

         Let us take the wider view. Statistics from Worksafe Australia record 455 deaths in the Australian workplace over 1991-92, while over 140,000 workers suffered some kind of job related injury requiring compensation. Given that many near misses will occur with every lost time injury reported, Australia has some distance to go in integrating a safe culture into the workplace. Our safety record reveals something disturbing about our society, especially as it is easier and less costly to implement effective safety programs than to cope with the aftermath of an accident. Nevertheless, there are trends towards improving safety in the offshore petroleum industry which the coalition wholeheartedly encourages. We support the amendments before the House.

          Australia has four diplomatic missions in Geneva and three ambassadors. Those missions include the United Nations, the environment, GATT and WTO, and disarmament. The Ambassador for the Permanent Mission to the Office of the United Nations is also the Ambassador for the Environment. There are currently 27 Australian based staff and 20 locally engaged staff. The committee was advised that it is not envisaged that more diplomatic staff will be posted to Geneva, nor is it envisaged that further Australian missions will be posted there. The Australian chancery in Geneva comprises leased premises which are deficient in access, services, layout and space. The lease will expire in March 1999 and will not be renewed. There is a need for a new chancery building to be constructed for Australia's permanent missions in Geneva.

          The original building which houses the Australian Embassy in Washington was constructed in 1969 and is well located at 1601 Massachusetts Avenue and was extended in 1976. But the building is now 25 years old and has not undergone a major refurbishment since it was constructed. Considering that the industry norm is to refurbish office buildings after 25 years, it is not unexpected that the Washington embassy now has many deficiencies. Quite frankly, it is looking its age, especially the interior. It lacks suitable fire protection and fire egress, and major building services have reached the end of their design life and require replacement. In addition, office layouts are inefficient. The provision for current and future technology is inadequate. Physical security protection is also deficient.

The bill would make machinery changes consequential to the implementation of changed case management arrangements for certain part-time and seasonal workers. It would also streamline certain administrative procedures relating to CES notification requirements and allow the Employment Services Regulatory Authority, ESRA, to obtain goods and services by using a credit card.

         In particular, the bill would allow for inclusion in determinations made under the act provisions relating to resetting unemployment registration to zero of particular clients who decline to continue to participate in the case management system. This is in line with announcements made in the 1995-96 budget and already implemented. The new arrangements were introduced for part-time and seasonal workers because they have substantial and recent work force experience and may not require, or in some instances want, the level of assistance provided under case management. The bill would seek to make consequential amendments to that part of the act that defines job compact eligibility for the purposes  of  a  case  management  activity agreement.

         The bill would streamline requirements on the CES to notify and interview a person after they become a participant in the case management system. The existing provisions of the  Employment Services Act 1994 require two separate contacts to be made, the first being when a person becomes a participant in the case management system and the second when the person is to be referred to a case manager. The bill would require the CES to make a single contact with the job seeker for the purpose of notifying participant status and for requesting the job seeker to attend or take part in an interview. Under the bill, notification that a person is a participant in the case management system will be made when the CES calls the job seeker in for an interview and considers that a referral can be made to a case manager within 24 days of a referral interview taking place.

Working Nation has become a monumental embarrassment to the government, is regarded around the country as simply a device to hide unemployed people from the statistics in an attempt to make the government look good in the run-up to the election campaign and offers far too little real practical assistance to unemployed people.

         At present the CES is required to notify a person that they have become a participant in the case management system as soon as practicable after they have become a participant. The reason why this provision was put in initially was to bump up the numbers apparently in the case management system as early as possible so that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) could appear in this House and tell us how many people were already participating in case management. The embarrassing thing about this particular proposal was that it meant there were many more people participating in case management than there were case managers able to handle them.

         So there were many instances of participants—the word `participants' has to have inverted commas around it in this particular context—who found it very difficult to ever get to meet their case manager. They were sitting around for prolonged periods waiting for that opportunity. Although the government was telling them and the nation that they were participating in case management, it was not apparent to them that they were.

         This meant that many people received two notices: one when they became a participant in the system, and the government could boast that they were in the system, but they could not be referred to a case manager; and another notice when they were referred to a case manager. It no longer serves the government's purpose to have these two notices. So we are told that on the basis of administrative efficiency we will now move back to one notice. The two-notice system served its original political purpose. Now we will move back to a one-notice system. From the point of view of unemployed people, this is a much more sensible arrangement. But it highlights—and let me underline this—the political design inherent in the original procedures established by the government.

         The bill also relates to job compact eligibility for certain seasonal and part-time workers. This is also to be amended in the bill. The definitions of persons eligible for the job compact is amended to include the requirement that, in addition to having been in receipt of the jobsearch, newstart or youth training allowance for a period of 18 months, a person must also have been registered with the CES for a period of 18 months. This is apparently to take account of persons who have had their CES registration date reset to zero. I understand that the reason for this is that the system was, by the way in which it was defined, drawing into the case management system people who were not appropriately case managed in their own eyes—indeed, they aimed to be part-time or casual workers—and otherwise were registered with the CES and formally eligible for case management but it was really not appropriate that case management be provided to them.

I am sure a close watch will be kept on her proclivities by the members of the ESRA board. The opposition will certainly be keeping a very close watch on the way in which this card is used.

         Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall that case management was highlighted in the white paper Working Nation as a means of tackling long-term unemployment through the jobs compact. It was to involve one-on-one service provided by a case manager to a job seeker unemployed for more than 12 months or considered to be at risk of becoming long-term unemployed. Case managers were to work with the job seeker to negotiate a case management activity agreement which sets out the course of action tailored to the needs of the job seeker and agreed between the job seeker and the case manager. The object is to assist the job seeker to obtain and retain lasting employment.

         It is clear that the case management system is not even now operating in an entirely satisfactory way in many parts of Australia. As I talk to unemployed people in different states, I find that it is still the case that many long-term unemployed people who have been assigned a case manager have not actually met their case manager. The one-on-one case management of the original Employment Services Act has not really materialised.

         I think it is fair to say, and this has certainly been confirmed in discussions I have had with officials in the department at the area level—I suppose that is the correct area description—that the concept of case management has really undergone some change since the initial white paper was brought down. Instead, today there are case managers with loads of over 200 cases. I have heard figures far higher than that. It is obviously the case that a case manager with such a load as that is in no position to provide the kind and quality of case management required which those with long experience of assisting the long-term unemployed know is required.

         Many contract case managers—that is, private providers of case management—face problems in getting started. Despite being advised that their tenders were successful, they waited for quite some time to be connected to the departmental computer system, which is essential to their effective operation.

         There is a belief, which I think should be dispelled by the government in its response in this debate, from the point of view of the contracted case managers that perhaps the department is retaining `easier' clients to ensure that their commencement and outcome figures are optimised. Certainly there is a problem that has been identified by many in Working Nation. I remember it was quite recently identified by the national executive director of skillshare, David Thompson, that the incentives in the system are such as to encourage officers of the department to place people in programs rather than to focus on the employment outcomes of the people who are being case managed, because the officer is assessed much more by the placement in a program, even if this does not lead to an employment outcome.

But there is no doubt that they are being hamstrung by the bureaucratic nature of the Working Nation package and its great complexity and by the fact that innovative and successful solutions which may vary from region to region, or even within regions, are constantly having to be altered or abandoned to fit the model of help laid down by the government.

         DEET has basically determined how unemployed people are to be helped. Unless you are prepared to help unemployed people in the way determined by the department, your scheme is most unlikely to receive departmental funding. Some comment can be made about that by way of exception because there is another tendency at present—that is, for funds to be made available almost on a `no questions asked' basis. The department is still finding that this massive pot of money has to be spent. Of course, the government is very keen that as much of it as possible be spent before the election campaign. The more people who are placed in subsidised employment of a project kind, as is the classic case, the better the unemployment statistics will look. Unfortunately, this reflects the fact that there is a great concern, I regret to say, on the part of the minister with the statistics rather than with actually making sure that unemployed people are receiving the employment opportunities that they so desperately need.

The Auditor-General's report revealed that there were significant weaknesses in the system which, according to the Auditor-General, must be `quickly remedied' as they reduce the capacity of the system to provide assistance to long-term unemployed people. The criticism made by many was borne out by the report—that many unemployed people had very tenuous links with their case manager or were not receiving effective assistance at all.

I have done this because of a very serious blunder made at the time. That blunder was to deny assistance to many unemployed people until they were long-term unemployed.

It claims that it has created over 600,000 jobs since the last election and that Working Nation is on target to achieve unemployment of around five per cent by the year 2000-01. The facts show that the reality is quite different from the impression that these claims are designed to create. The recession we had to have destroyed 337,300 jobs. Net job creation is about half the number claimed by the government—net being once you take away from the 600,000 or so jobs, the jobs that were destroyed. These net new jobs have been insufficient to meet the demand from the growing number of people in the work force. In other words, over the last five years job creation has not kept up with the growth in the work force. As a result of that, over the last five years unemployment has gone up from 6.2 to 8.5 per cent.

         —In 2040, as the member for Ballarat reminds me. It has gone out a very long way. Of course, in the employment area, we are asked not to think about the unemployment rate—one of the highest in the industrialised world—but to think about what it might be in five years time, and that might be five per cent, according to the government. Our view is that the growth in the economy at the moment and the likely growth is nowhere near enough to get unemployment down to five per cent by the end of the decade. Even if it were five per cent by the end of the decade, youth unemployment, which is typically three times the adult rate, would still be about 15 per cent. So it is not a great outcome.

         It is clear that virtually no responsible commentator believes for a moment that the government is correct when it makes these claims. The claims are, in a literal sense of the word, incredible—unbelievable. The rate of economic growth over the year to the end of June 1995 was 3.7 per cent. The government has been saying that if we can sustain economic growth at about four per cent, we can get unemployment down. The Prime Minister has stated that if you can't get four per cent, you might as well give the game away. The government has not been able to get four per cent. It is falling well short of that, and well short of its predictions.

         Australia needs two simple things in relation to unemployment. The first is obvious—that is, jobs for all people who want to work, jobs created through business confidence and support. Secondly, we need a dynamic attitude shift among Australians, to once again believe that to earn a living through gainful employment and work, and long-term employment, is a real alternative to accepting government handouts. This brings a bundle of associated social concerns, such as the ability to earn a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. But this is not under question at the moment.

Having had an extended period of unemployment when I was quite young, after transferring from Victoria to Western Australia, I can say that it can be quite a shattering experience to be out of work for a long period.

         The bill being discussed today does not address this fundamental of creating jobs. The essence of this bill, as I see it, is the issue of case management, a concept which I find most unappealing in both the term itself and its activity base. I am appalled that unemployed persons are referred to as `cases'. They are not medical problems and they are not part of student case studies. They are quite simply people who want to work. They are in need of a job—nothing more, nothing less.

The fact is that all they need is employment guidance, a helping hand and a lead in the right direction. They do not need to be forced into any situation. They do not need to be managed as you would manage livestock in a yard. They need help, assistance, guidance and support—not management. For goodness sake!

         Case management, as it was termed, was highlighted in the white paper Working Nation as a means of tackling long-term unemployment through the so-called jobs compact. This was to involve a one on one service and liaison between a case manager and job seeker who has been unemployed for more than 12 months or considered to be at risk of being long-term unemployed.

         Let us be reasonable. Some case managers have workloads of 200 cases. They really cannot be expected to cope with demands of this magnitude. The one on one case management concept, as in the original employment services bill, has not materialised. Many of these people are contracted to positions through a tendering arrangement. They should reasonably expect support from the government in undertaking their roles. However, even after being accepted as contractors—all signed, sealed and delivered—they have to wait for some time just to be connected to the departmental CES computer system, a pivotal element in their successful operation.

As the number of aviation personnel increased, the Australians were told that it was only an interim arrangement and that, as recruitment increased, so the civilians would be sent back and Australians would take over their various roles. Alongside both the civilian Singaporean and the Australian contractor personnel was a large contingent of uniformed RSAF maintenance personnel.

         By January-February 1994, recruitment of Australian personnel had increased but not to a sufficient degree to compensate the resignation rate of the initial Australian employees. Terms and conditions of employment, and the contrast between what Australians were led to believe would happen and what in actual fact was happening, were the primary reasons for the resignation rate, which was exceeding 50 per cent. There were also grave concerns in the areas of safety, maintenance standards, wage rates, hours of duty and shift arrangements, and a general feeling that the Australian personnel were compromised in their professionalism and future prospects for employment in the Australian aviation industry.

         In May 1994 it became apparent that uniformed RSAF personnel were returning to Singapore, not the civilian SAE personnel, who still remain employed by PAE—as I have said, an Australian company—in Australia under GOS travel orders. It also became apparent that PAE management was actively encouraging RSAF maintenance personnel to discharge from the RSAF with the promise of guaranteed employment with PAE in Australia at the RSAF flying training school. This is a blatant abuse of the originally agreed position.

         As a consequence, a situation now exists where an Australian company is employing overseas labour to the detriment of the Australian work force by apparently rorting the SOFA agreement between the two countries.

         —Mr Speaker, as you would appreciate, I am a very strong supporter of representative and accountable administration of Australia's major sporting codes. I do not believe, for instance, that unrepresentative, unaccountable media barons, like Rupert Murdoch and Kerry Packer, should control rugby league or rugby union in this country. You can imagine my delight upon reading the recommendations of the recent Temby report on the administration of thoroughbred racing in New South Wales.

         The report recommends that the Australian Jockey Club be stripped of its governing powers and that a thoroughbred racing council be established. It is very important for an industry with a net revenue of $350 million, for an industry that brings employment and so much entertainment to so many people in New South Wales, to have effective and representative administration.

This is something I am sure the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) will be interested in, being a long and strong fighter for the rights of women in Australia.

         Small punters, small owners and small trainers in the thoroughbred racing industry have never been effectively represented by the Australian Jockey Club.

         —The recent opening of the 2.1 kilometre extension of the Plenty Road light rail from the Bundoora shopping centre, McLeans Road, to McKimmies Road and the Bundoora RMIT campus was an extremely positive outcome for students of RMIT and for residents and future residents in the estates along Plenty Road, an achievement celebrated by a community fair at RMIT. It was an extremely positive outcome for the Better Cities program. It was a personal triumph for Brian Howe, the Minister for Housing and Regional Development, and the architect of the Better Cities program. However, had you read the local paper the week before the opening, you might have been forgiven for thinking that the federal government had nothing to do with the project. The publicity department of the Victorian Public Transport Corporation had worked overtime on the publicity, announcing details of the opening without bothering to mention from where the money had come, which was of course the building better cities program—to the tune of some $12.6 million.

         At the opening, which was carried out jointly by Brian Howe and the state Minister for Public Transport, Alan Brown, much was said along the lines that the extension was a shining example of effective cooperation between the federal and state governments. The Minister for Housing and Regional Development himself said that local, state and federal government had worked together on this model project. The minister was being modest and undervaluing his role and the federal government's role in this project. It may well have finished up a model of intergovernmental cooperation. It quite easily could have ended up a model of intergovernment uncooperation.

         The fact is that when the original announcement was made in December 1991, the project included the extension of the light rail approximately three kilometres to Childs Road, Mill Park. Not only would this have serviced the rapidly growing Bundoora campuses of RMIT but also the extra kilometre would have brought the tram to the 30,000 residents living in the suburb of Mill Park.

         The housing development in Mill Park has the types of problems that the Better Cities program was designed to address, such as a gross lack of public infrastructure. It is a great shame that the tram was not extended, as originally announced. The reason it was not extended to Mill Park is simple: Jeffrey `Glib' Kennett was elected Premier of Victoria. The change of government in 1992 brought a change of Better Cities priorities. Initially the Victorian Liberal government wanted to drop this extension altogether. It was only pressure from the federal government that put the extension, at least as far as RMIT, back on the rails. Without the pressure from the federal government and the funds from the federal government the light rail would not have moved one centimetre further along Plenty Road past the previous terminus at McLeans Road.

         It is regrettable that this attitude of the state government makes it unlikely, if not impossible, for the remainder of the project to be considered in the next round of Better Cities funding, which with a cooperative outlook it might well have been. What this episode demonstrates is that Commonwealth-state relations are tenuous, require the vigilance of the Commonwealth and need overhaul—but not the sort of overhaul envisaged by the coalition. As is clear from the recent comments of the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party (Mr Costello), the coalition if it achieved government is intent on handing over large areas of Commonwealth authority to the states. This has all been heard before—from Fraser, from Hewson, and now from the Howard-Costello biumvirate.

         I commend the cooperation that has taken place thus far between some state government departments, the Urban Land Authority, local government and a range of community agencies led by the federally funded Family Resource Centre in Thomastown. For the Janefield development not to simply replay the mistakes of the past there must be a whole-of-government approach, especially at the state level. While the signs are encouraging, there is evidence that at least one state department will not fully participate in a proper planning process. An official of the Department of School Education, a notorious department under Mr Kennett, told a public meeting, `They do not take the advice of anybody on where they build their schools,' when it was suggested that as part of the proposed development of the Janefield land an alternative site for the Bundoora Primary School might be considered. This attitude is of great concern. Better Cities is about avoiding these mistakes, not replicating them.

I raised this issue in 1990, in 1991, in 1992, in 1993, in 1994 and in 1995 on many occasions. The federal government has refused on every occasion to come to the aid of the city of Bendigo and all of the townships along the route of that highway to upgrade it to four lanes and include it in the national highway system. I have spoken to the Victorian state government and they have at last cooperated with us. It took a change of government to achieve this; the former Labor government, the Cain-Kirner government, would not. We have developed a total strategy for the whole length of the Calder Highway from the bay to the Murray at Mildura. It will include a four-lane divided freeway between Melbourne and Kyneton, a four-lane divided highway between Kyneton and Bendigo and a reservation suitable for conversion to freeway standard in the longer term and a two-lane highway north of Bendigo with driving conditions appropriate for a major state highway with adequate overtaking opportunities and full access for efficient freight vehicles.

         The role of the Calder Highway is very important in Victoria and in Australia's future.

         The strategy requires $36 million per annum. The states are going to come up with some money.

         I was interested to hear the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) indicate that it is time the states did something. Here is an opportunity for the federal government to do something. The state government has come up with a strategy. It is prepared to do its part and put its dollars in. If the Commonwealth government is not prepared to accept that the Calder Highway should be part of the national highway system, it has to accept the responsibility for funding part of this highway. Country users are major contributors, through fuel excise, to the federal coffers. The member for McEwen would acknowledge that fact. He is probably trying to get some of the roads in his area upgraded.

         Here is the opportunity for the federal government to provide some additional funds to the Calder Highway, which is a most important road in Australia—leading to all of that primary production area north of Melbourne, providing ready access to the ports and airports and providing access for personal travel and tourism. It is an important link and it is one on which the federal government has done some work—I acknowledge that fact—but little enough, bearing in mind the massive amount of fuel excise it collects on every litre of fuel. Fifty per cent of all fuel costs is fuel excise—another tax on the motorist—and a minimum amount of that money is returned for road funding.

         —I again bring to the House a black book—the book of Victorian horror stories—and from that I extract yet another story of misery and horror being imposed on the Victorian people by the conservatives of this country. When we talk about lies, deceit and policies, we know what they in Victoria stand for and what the conservatives will do in federal government because we see it daily in Victoria. This is an extract from today's

         entitled `Tehan's miserable cuts'. It concerns the second national mental health report on funding for the mentally ill in Victoria. The report states:

       </para>
       <para>
        In Victoria, unfortunately, they get shot too often by an uncaring government. The 1995 report has found that Victoria was the only state in Australia to cut its mental health service—the only state. We know what it has done to the public hospital system. For every dollar the Commonwealth puts in, Victoria takes $1 out of the system. So mental health, of course, is a major concern now in Victoria.

         Not only did the Victorian government make a massive 5.8 per cent cut to its mental health spending in 1994 but, as the report points out, incredibly it siphoned off into general revenue half of the $30 million saved in the widespread closure of beds in separate psychiatric hospitals. This is the conservative policy. This is what we expect out of a Howard government and this is what we know it will do. It does not care very much for people with mental illness, and we see that in Victoria.

         The Commonwealth Department of Human Services and Health further found that specialist mental health services are failing to provide any treatment for a staggering half of those Victorians with a serious mental illness. You hear a few mutters on the other side, but if the members from Victoria making the little grunts over there were so concerned with what is happening in Victoria, then we would hear them in this House talking about the lies and deceit that occur in Victoria. We would hear them standing up for ordinary Victorians who are suffering so greatly under this uncaring and unsympathetic Liberal-National Party government. As I have pointed out, the reality is that, if the funding cuts keep going, it is only a question of time in Victoria before country public hospitals will close.

         We know that in Victoria you die waiting for an ambulance—unfortunately, a not uncommon occurrence now in Victoria. Unfortunately, it is all too common. Just ask Mrs Chong, whose husband died very recently. She was an intelligent, articulate woman, who knew her husband suffered from heart illness and heart disease. When he had a heart attack, she picked up the phone and she requested a MICA ambulance—a highly specialised group of people with defibrillators who can handle heart attacks. That is why these ambulances exist in Victoria. Mrs Chong knew what the problem of her husband was. She knew he had a heart attack; she knew he needed a MICA ambulance. But no MICA ambulance turned up. After some 20 minutes wait, a normal service arrived, and Mrs Chong said, `I want a MICA ambulance.' It took another 20-odd minutes before a MICA ambulance turned up.

         Unfortunately, Mr Chong died. He died because of a Liberal-National Party government that does not care about people and that is slashing so deeply into the health budget in Victoria that it is now common practice for ordinary Victorians to die for lack of services. Mental health patients are ignored on the streets of Melbourne. One unfortunate lady was recently shot by the police because there was no service, no help and no assistance.

         But the government are not satisfied with the savage cuts they have already made. Each year in Victoria there is now a further 1.5 per cent efficiency dividend—that is what they call it, an efficiency dividend. That is Liberal-National Party code for further cuts. So all of the services have to keep finding, up to the year 2000, an additional 1.5 per cent cut per annum.

         If the conservatives on the other side of the House are really concerned about lies and deceit, they should ask Jeffrey Kennett why in 1992 he did not tell the Victorian people what he intended to do to them. They should ask him what he intended to do to the public hospitals and to the mental health system.

         —In the short time I have left, I would like to advise the House that some time this week we are celebrating ABC Day, which is the Australian Breast Cancer Day. Breast cancer is a very serious issue amongst Australian women. It kills something like 2,500 Australian women a year, which equates to six per day, and it is the highest cause of death in women aged between 35 and 54.

         I have spoken on this issue many times since 1993. I was involved in the Lobby for Life group in 1994, which obtained about 100,000 Australian signatures to present to parliament asking for increased funding, and we saw the increase of funding in the 1994 budget. It is a very important issue—something that we should reflect on this week. It is Australian Breast Cancer Day, ABC Day, and I urge all Australians to consider donating some money to research. I also urge all Australian women to be concerned about their own health, in particular breast cancer, and ask them to be very aware of their requirements to overcome any particular potential that they might have with breast cancer.

         I also reflect in the last 50 seconds I have that I spent some time with a hospice unit recently. I met a young lady of 35 years who was dying of cervical cancer. I implore women, not as a paternalistic person but as an Australian male—and I have recently had friends in my age group who have suffered from cervical cancer—to please seek pap smears as much as possible, even if it is only every 12 months, because it is a very dangerous condition for women in their late 30s. I ask them to consider that and to seek pap smears as much as possible.

        (1) I invited the General Secretary of the Vietnamese Communist Party, Mr Do Muoi, to Australia when we met in Vietnam in April 1994. The General Secretary visited Australia from 29 July to 4 August 1995. (a)  He was invited in his General Secretary capacity. He was given Head of Government status, commensurate with his stature in the Vietnamese political system and previous practice in this area. (b) The cost to the Commonwealth of the visit, based on advice from relevant departments, was $337,512. (c) The purpose of the visit was to continue the development of a partnership between Vietnam and Australia, based on shared interests in the region, substantial commercial ties, assistance in development, and growing people-to-people contacts. (d) During his visit, in addition to his meeting with me, the General Secretary met the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Premier of New South Wales, the Premier of Victoria, the Queensland Minister for Minerals and Energy, and senior members of the business community including representatives of Telstra, BHP, ANZ Bank, Transfield, Pacific Power, Draytons and Queensland Alumina Limited.

        It is not clear what is meant by private advantage. To some extent any consultant (or researcher) may gain a potential saleable benefit from doing work which improves skill and knowledge and which demonstrates success. This is similar to a surgeon working for a public hospital who, through conducting operations and using the facilities of the hospital, may gain skills which contribute to the surgeon being able to earn private income in the future by treating private patients. This incidental commercial benefit from conducting consultancy work is a natural event.

        As indicated in my response to Mr Latham's Question No. 2382 (part 3) on 31 May 1995, the Northern Territory formally agreed to ratification in May 1995. All jurisdictions, except New South Wales and Tasmania have now formally agreed to ratification. The New South Wales Department of Industrial Relations has consulted with the Workcover Authority with a view to achieving compliance with the Convention. A submission is currently being prepared for consideration by the New South Wales Minister for Industrial Relations in order to further progress the matter. Tasmania has identified two relatively minor compliance problems, which are expected to be overcome when the Workplace Health and Safety Bill 1995 is passed into legislation.
