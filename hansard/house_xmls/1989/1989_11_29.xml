        The Bill before the House amends the National Health Act 1953 as it relates to the membership of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. It increases to four the additional members that can be appointed to the Tribunal by the Minister. As agreed, the Bill makes provision for one of the additional members to have had experience in community pharmacy. I can state that this person will be appointed only after consultation with key organisations representing pharmacy, including, of course, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia.

        These amendments do not in any way reflect upon the present membership of the Tribunal or the decisions made by those persons. I wish to take this opportunity to thank the present Tribunal members for their diligence and efforts in what has become a very difficult time and in their handling of a highly technical area. The Bill changes the provisions relating to a quorum of the Tribunal; which will now be the chairperson and at least two additional members. This amendment takes into account the new additional members. I commend the Bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill.

        —by leave-This is the third report presented by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology and the first report on the North West Shelf. The report is entitled, I think appropriately, A sea of lost opportunities?. When the Committee set out to look at this, very few members of the Committee understood what was involved with the North West Shelf project in terms of its size and scope. I officially put on record my appreciation to the joint venture partners, and Woodside Offshore Petroleum Pty Ltd in particular, for the cooperation they gave to the Committee. I assure Woodside that there has been no witch-hunt in trying to lay blame for the lack of Australian industry participation in the North West Shelf at the door of those predominantly overseas controlled companies.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       There is a great question to be asked about these very large resource projects not only in terms of the income generated for Australia by the export of natural gas from the North West Shelf to Japan and its supply to the Western Australian domestic market, but also in considering, as the Committee has done, what there is for Australian industry. The Committee is critical in many ways of the approach taken by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. Some of the recommendations in the report refer specifically to how it feels the Department can improve its game in gaining an overall benefit to Australia from very large natural resource projects.
      </para>
      <para>
       There has been a great upsurge in exploration in the North West Shelf. The north-west of Australia is very much on the verge of establishing a new industry. With the Carnarvon Basin, the Timor Sea and now the agreement with Indonesia on the Timor Gap, Australia faces the prospect of substantial oil and gas offshore fields. We must now take the opportunity to ensure that Australian industry participates in these projects for the benefit of Australian industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are many short term negatives for Australia in these projects. The scope and size of the projects are quite mind-boggling. The current North West Shelf project being operated by Woodside will have a $14 billion price tag, $8.6 billion being spent by the time the Goodwyn platform is complete. The initial impact of this on the terms of trade and balance of payments is quite large. A large proportion of this infrastructure is imported when the Committee feels that Australian industry can participate in and benefit from such large scale projects. We have called the report A sea of lost opportunities? because the Committee as a whole feels that over the years governments have looked only at the export of the natural product, be it gas or oil, rather than at the integrated performance that can be generated for Australian industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       Australia has had a cultural cringe over many years that it cannot produce high technology or world standard projects. We as a Committee discount this and think that in recent times Australian industry has shown that it can conduct projects of world scale. There are two classic examples-the submarine project that the Government is undertaking and the decision by the Government to build the frigates in Australia-of projects of a scale and scope similar to the projects of the North West Shelf. We think that Australian industry for the first time has been able to quantify what the additional cost will be, particularly for the frigate project. In evidence we were told that the premium that had to be paid to gain 82 per cent of Australian industry participation was 4 per cent. When we talk about projects of this scale, it is not a large premium to pay.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee looked at a number of Australian companies which are at the forefront of world technology in fabrication, particularly Hu-Metal Engineering Pty Ltd in Victoria, which has developed a new rolling technology that could be appropriate for the development of piles and platforms not only in the North West Shelf but throughout the world. That company has patented this rolling technology and it is of world standard.
      </para>
      <para>
       I said earlier that in the report we were critical, and remain critical, of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. We were amazed at some of the evidence given by the Department and in particular at the fact that there had been no consultation that we could see between the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. We feel that the two departments should work closely together so that Australian industry can provide the necessary jobs and also develop world-class technologies that can give Australia an advantage and an enhanced industrial base.
      </para>
      <para>
       The problem we found in all these projects was that, when assessing benefits to Australia, the Department had assessed only the resource benefit and not the total benefit, which is much more important. If Australia is to be an industrialised nation and not just an exporter of commodities-as we have always been told-we must value add. One of the ways we can do that is by providing a large measure of Australian industry participation. The Committee recommended that we try to gain some definition of Australian content. We were told that there is 72 per cent Australian content in the North Rankin project on the North West Shelf. In fact, much of that Australian content was in infrastructure in providing and building the necessary buildings and storage facilities that could only ever be done in this country anyway.
      </para>
      <para>
       What is much more important in developing these types of projects is that we get the intellectual capacity and the intellectual qualities of design and technology, and we have made a number of recommendations in this regard. We have also looked in some detail at examples overseas, particularly the British example, in Margaret Thatcher's United Kingdom, where even in that free enterprise mentality the Government is very insistent on a high level of British industry participation. Something like 82 per cent British industry participation was achieved in the North Sea. That is not done by legislation; it is done by consultation and cohesion to ensure that British industry can participate fairly and equitably.
      </para>
      <para>
       One of the great problems for Australian industry is that, in the design and technology sections, specifications can be written in such a way that it is very difficult for Australian industries to comply with the specifications. We have recommended in this report that international standards be set right at the start of these projects so that Australian companies can tender on a competitive basis. We have also recommended in this report that early notice be given of major development projects and that Australian companies know well in advance what projects are coming up. The Department of Primary Industries and Energy already requires that a proposal be put to the Department fairly early in the piece, and we feel that requirement should be made more public so that Australian companies know what is coming up.
      </para>
      <para>
       We have done a lot of work in the compilation of this report in a reasonably short space of time and covered quite a distance around Australia. I would like to put on record my thanks to the other members of the Committee from all parties in this Parliament who have put a great deal of effort into what has been a very difficult task. I also put on record my thanks to the Committee secretariat-Doug Capp, Chris Paterson and Jodie Kiermaier-for the excellent work they did in producing the report under very difficult circumstances.
      </para>
      <para>
       I do not want to take up a deal of time because, in the spirit of bipartisanship that has pervaded this Committee, many members wish to speak, and I do feel that that is the way these sorts of reports should be handled. The inquiry has been particularly informative for all members of the Committee. When this project started none of us knew what a jacket or a pile was. Now we are all experts in technology and we know what the make-ups of an offshore platform are. Through the good grace of Woodside Offshore Petroleum Pty Ltd, we were able to visit the North Rankin platform on the North West Shelf, and that was a very informative exercise. I commend the report to the House.

        —by leave-I support the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, the honourable member for Rankin (Mr Beddall), in tabling the report entitled The North West Shelf-A sea of lost opportunities? I also echo the sentiments of the Chairman about the cooperative way in which the Committee operated in tabling what I think is a very good and interesting report. As the Chairman said, the North West Shelf project is really quite an exciting project. Capital expenditure of $14 billion is foreshadowed. It is a major export earner, $700m having been spent on exploration, which is something that a lot of Australians have overlooked because they have been overwhelmed by the magnitude of the project and the way it is now being constructed. It is a world-class project in terms of design and the risk that the joint venturers have undertaken in that difficult natural climate.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The key element of the project that came through to the Committee was that the natural gas provided a base load of energy for Western Australia and Japan. Western Australia will enjoy natural gas for 20 years and Japan will get 16 per cent of its natural gas from the project by 1995. Australia will have 40 per cent of its energy requirements from that source.
      </para>
      <para>
       As the Chairman mentioned, we visited the North Rankin platform, which was quite an exciting and elevating experience. That platform, which is some 125 miles offshore, has survived `a once in 300 years' gale and the design of the platform withstood those tremendous pressures. At that time there were 23-metre waves and the cyclone passed over the top of the platform. The Goodwyn field, in the construction of which we had a major interest-and that is what the report is all about-has a bigger platform with a 17,000-tonne jacket and a 15,000-tonne module on top of the jacket, indicating the scale of operation that Australian manufacturers are being asked to tender for.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Committee was particularly interested in the role of the Government, and the Chairman has made reference to the Committee's apprehensions and concerns that some government departments were not fully aware of the implications of the project. The Government is controlling the leases of the offshore operations and the production licences. The report suggests that governments should be aware of the implications and evaluate these large projects, especially in view of the overseas borrowings, the foreign expertise and equipment required and the debt servicing requirements of such projects. The North West Shelf project will receive income of $41 billion over 20 years, of which the Government will receive $10 billion from royalties and taxes in the same period. There should be a set of criteria-and we set that out in the reports-for assessing these bigger projects.
      </para>
      <para>
       I was personally particularly interested in the viability and risk and the regulatory aspects of governments in this whole area of resource exploration and the setting up of these particular projects. The North West Shelf project was considered to be marginal by the joint venturers when they made their final decision to proceed. However, they did indicate to the Committee that they took a 20-year view of oil and energy prices, and the oil companies discounted their capital investment by 20 per cent to make sure that they were on the right side of the ledger.
      </para>
      <para>
       The report mentions that the construction period was a matter of some debate with a number of witnesses. The project period of 27 months seemed to be under a certain amount of discussion, especially having in mind the cyclone season and the very important `window of opportunity' that was often quoted to us at the stage when the jacket had to be put in place, when the seasonal conditions were acceptable. A lot of concern was expressed by witnesses about the industrial disputes that might upset the whole program. However, we were encouraged by the attitudes of unions and management in that they were cooperating and trying very hard to overcome the difficulties that had been encountered in other projects in north-west Australia. Our view is that there are very encouraging signs from unions and management that they were sorting out their problems before the project got under way.
      </para>
      <para>
       As I mentioned earlier, the base load operation meant that there had to be a very important emphasis on quality, and the Committee was looking at ways of improving the Australian participation and content in the project. The Chairman mentioned that there seemed to be about a 74 per cent content on the project by Australian manufacturers and the Australian work force. The Committee was particularly interested in the quality controls by management, the delays in delivery that might upset the project, the price of the various items of the total project and the safety performances on the construction phase. The reports indicated that there was a very good record on safety by both management and the unions. Of course, the other problems that were highlighted were the shortage of skilled engineers here in Australia and the lack of infrastructure that was available for these one-off projects.
      </para>
      <para>
       The capability and capacity of Australian industry to compete is the key element of our report. We are suggesting that Australians have the capacity to compete. However, the evidence indicated that when the overseas option was available there was a tendency for the joint venturers to take that option rather than have a good look at the Australian possibility. The problems of fabrication of the jacket and module were, as I mentioned, constrained by the lack of onshore facilities and the lack of big cranes to shift these particularly heavy fabricated pieces from the construction site.
      </para>
      <para>
       Finally, Dr John White of Australian Marine Engineering Consolidated Ltd gave the Committee some intimation of what can be done. As the Chairman mentioned, it is now building frigates at the Williamstown dockyards. That is quite an inspirational story of what major Australian engineering firms can do. Dr John White has experience in the North West Shelf area and has indicated that big projects can be completed. The frigate project indicates the possibility that this can be done. Dr White made the point that when Australians do big projects, the supplying, support and maintenance of fabricated materials means that the plant is in position and that the supplier can service it over the next 20 years.
      </para>
      <para>
       I thank the Chairman and members of the Committee for their cooperation and I thank the members of staff for an excellent report. I hope that the report will encourage Australian heavy manufacturers to change their attitude to Australian projects over the next 20 years.

        —by leave-I join with previous speakers in commending to the House the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology's report entitled The North West Shelf-A sea of lost opportunities? This report has the potential to transform the approach of Australian and overseas companies to the development of Australian resources. The facts that emerged during the inquiry were surprising and disappointing. They reflected a very long period in Australia's economic history where we have focused on resource export and not on the implications of resource development itself.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       When one looks at what the joint venture partners have achieved it is important to make very public and very clear that their standing with Australian manufacturers is very low, their credibility as to how they have approached the project is suspect and there is a great deal more that they could and should do if they truly desire to be good corporate citizens in this country. I want to give an example of that. We are aware of the cost pressures on resource sales, whether they be coal, gas or oil. We are not so aware of the fact that the major competition comes from the same companies that export from Australia, and the fact that this is forcing down energy prices. This affects in particular the gas field in the north where gas reserves are being developed by partners in the North West Shelf project. It is vital to recognise that, whether the company is Shell Australia, Shell Malaysia or Shell in some other part of the world, it is still Shell. Clearly Shell's corporate interests will always override what many of us see as Australia's national interest.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is also important to recognise the obvious quid pro quo in marketing and manufacturing. There is no doubt in my mind-and, I would think, the minds of many people on the Committee and in the wider manufacturing community-that a great deal of the tendering relates to the selling of the product. I do not think there is any question but that the manufacture of ships for the transport of gas in Japan relates quite specifically and virtually totally to the fact that Japanese companies are the buyers of the gas. In other words, they say, `If we do not build your ships we will not buy your gas'. So a large part of the value of gas sales goes back to Japan through construction value for those ships. I cannot be persuaded that the ships could not be built somewhere else in the world-perhaps even in Australia-at a lower price. It is no coincidence that so much of the manufacturing flow-on from this project goes to the countries that buy the product. There may be valid and justifiable reasons for things of that nature but those reasons are not public or visible.
      </para>
      <para>
       If one compares Australia's performance in projects such as this with, say, that of Norway, a country of just over a quarter of our size, and looks at the chemical and manufacturing industries, it is obvious that we have been a very open and easy country to deal with and exploit. The fact that, despite many months of serious attempts to probe into the question, we still do not know the net effect on the Australian balance of payments leaves a question mark hanging over the credibility of the joint venture partners. I asked them quite specifically and directly whether they would advise us of their debt servicing costs, their expected expatriation of profits and expected expenditure in both transport and manufacturing overseas so that we on the Committee and in the Parliament could say that even though we have not done as well as we could with manufacturing we have gained X billion dollars in net benefit in terms of Australia's trade. The joint venturers declined to provide the information that they obviously must have. That was their choice. By making that choice I believe they leave themselves in a very poor situation in regard to their corporate image and credibility in this country. If we cannot obtain the manufacturing and skills transfer, clearly we should obtain a benefit to our balance of payments and net standing in the world. We appear to do poorly in both aspects.
      </para>
      <para>
       Recommendation 3 of the Committee recommends, for projects of this nature, the establishment of a new procedure which we refer to as an economic impact statement or assessment. Projects of this magnitude with this capacity to affect our economy and internal industries need to be looked at as total projects, not as relative projects or tax-raising projects or as being employers of X hundred or thousand people. Over decades this country's historical failure to recognise resource development in that way has led to this report being so important.
      </para>
      <para>
       This report has the potential to transform the way we approach resources development in this country. I do not doubt that many of us believe that that is a vital need. I urge the joint venture partners and other developers and would-be developers of Australian resources to be much more transparent and open, to bring their proposals, plans and expectations to Australia both in the public and industry sectors so that when we accept these projects and endorse them, and they proceed, they do so with us having full knowledge and understanding of all of the implications. The failure at the start of this project for that process to be required has meant that we have encouraged secrecy. Information has been hidden away and we have established precedents as a country that has virtually told developers that we do not expect them to disclose what they are doing, we do not want to know what they are doing, as long as the project appears good on the surface.
      </para>
      <para>
       The North West Shelf project could be the best project in Australia's history, or it could be the worst. My fear is that it may be the worst. We cannot force the joint venture partners to change their procedures from what they were allowed to set up some 10 or 15 years ago-that is history-but I strongly and strenuously urge them to do so. If they continue to operate in Australia in the way they have in the past I suspect that in years to come they will regret any decision not to change their methodology, become more open and generally embrace and involve Australian companies. This is an important report. I trust and hope that it changes the attitudes of both government departments and developers about the development of Australian resources. I commend the report to the House.

        —by leave-I would like to join with other members of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology in speaking briefly to the report entitled The North West Shelf-A sea of lost opportunities? I commend the report to the Parliament. I particularly wish to support the words of the Chairman, the honourable member for Rankin (Mr Beddall), and my colleague the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur). I think it is important for everyone to realise the size of this project. It is enormous. It is probably the first project of its kind in Australia and, as such, has required the development of a lot of new technology and skills which in many cases did not exist in Australia. That development certainly has occurred, and, while certainly a lot of the Australian content in this project refers to infrastructure that has to be made in Australia anyway, nonetheless there is quite a good level of Australian involvement.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I point out to honourable members that, as the Committee says at the beginning of the report, we received considerable assistance from Woodside Offshore Petroleum Pty Ltd and the joint venture participants of the North West Shelf project. While the Committee was made aware of growing criticism of Woodside and the joint venturers, particularly for not providing sufficient opportunity for Australian industry participation in this project, as we pointed out in the introduction to the report we found that that was not the case. I would have to take a slightly different tack from the previous speaker, the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris). Certainly I disagree with the tone of some of his comments. I do not hold the same fears as the previous speaker about the possibility of this being, I think in this words, `one of the worst projects in our history'.
      </para>
      <para>
       Putting that aside, as we say in the introduction to the report, Woodside has provided Australian industry with considerable opportunity to participate in the project. Woodside has been very positive in its attempts to assess Australian industry capability and apprise Australian industry of market opportunities. The overall level of Australian industry participation has been equal to that of many other major resource projects. As we point out, Woodside has complied with its obligations as they currently stand. So the question then arises-I do not know that we can immediately find the answer-as to what are reasonable obligations to place on a developer such as Woodside and its joint venture partners in bringing this project to fruition and at the same time provide the maximum opportunity for Australian involvement. As has been pointed out by the Chairman, at the beginning of the inquiry we were under the impression that the Commonwealth departments responsible for resource development and industry policy would be able to provide a great deal of assistance in the conduct of the inquiry. As we point out in the report, this did not prove to be the case. That, in itself, is a fairly strong criticism of those departments.
      </para>
      <para>
       As mentioned, in the development of the project we have seen the development of considerable expertise. We are pushing to see maximum Australian involvement particularly at the design stage. With a new type of project such as this, it is not surprising that the joint venture partners would want the best available involvement in the world. Since Australia had not been involved in the design of such a project, it was hardly reasonable to expect people to ask Australian engineers to design these things. Nonetheless, having got this type of project up and running, it is important that we ensure that Australians get involved in the design stage of future projects like this one. In fact, we might be able to develop an industry that will service other parts of the world, particularly South East Asia where there are many opportunities.

       Another problem facing Australian industry is the difficulty of the costs of transport from eastern Australian to Western Australia. This was evidenced time and again. There are difficulties with transport, both by sea and by land, in trying to get major components across to the North West Shelf. This has shown that Australia's infrastructure, our service industries, our ability to use shipping and land transport, need upgrading. If it takes a project such as this to highlight this point, so be it. Obviously, Western Australia, because of its location, has been the major beneficiary in this regard. That is quite understandable.
      </para>
      <para>
       I would like briefly to talk about some of the problems that have been highlighted which face Australian manufacturers, particularly when there is no equivalent Australian material, yet an Australian manufacturer, when having to import some material, is still forced to pay some duty. I feel very strongly about this. There was a similar incident in my electorate involving an Australian manufacturer being penalised when trying to compete with overseas manufacturers. Recommendation No. 12 of the report has wider application but certainly has very strong application for Australian industry trying to compete in these sorts of projects. The Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business (Mr Barry Jones) and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) should ensure that customs duties are waived where specified materials required for fabrication work are not available in Australia. Likewise, if local manufacturers claim to make an equivalent they must be able to demonstrate compliance with the particular design specifications. The onus is on the two departments and their Ministers to look into this. It is a very significant penalty for Australian manufacturers who are trying to compete.
      </para>
      <para>
       In winding up my remarks, I reinforce the views of the honourable member for Corangamite in talking about the spin-off to Australian industry in getting involved in this sort of project. The case presented to the Committee by Dr White is very significant and very exciting. I think that all members of the Committee were most impressed with it. They realised the enormous spin-off benefits to Australian industry of getting involved in a project such as the North West Shelf. The other benefit of the project is that it is forcing Australian companies to think globally, to realise that we have to compete in the world, not just locally. Again, that will clean out many cobwebs.
      </para>
      <para>
       As the Chairman has pointed out, this is a first report. We will be looking to explore further some of the areas we have mentioned in the report. We will obviously be looking for some feedback from those who have assisted with the inquiry. In that way, the approach of the joint venturers, Australian industry and the Government to these sorts of projects will be improved. I too, would like to thank the secretariat. I also commend the Chairman for the way he has conducted this inquiry and look forward to being involved in its next stage.

        —That is right. The Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology report entitled The North West Shelf-A sea of lost opportunities? is probably one of the more significant reports to come before the Parliament for quite some time. It is about Australian manufacturing industries and development. This report is important not only because it is about a very large development but also because it discloses, in many respects, our lack of preparedness to gain the maximum advantage from developments which require not only a great deal of fabrication but also a lot of technological know-how.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       One problem that we encountered in our inquiries was the concern that a large number of industries had that they were not being given access to some of the technological transfer which ought to take place in a project of this kind. A very large proportion of the fabrication component of the project was given to Australian firms but some of the very crucial technological components of the project still appeared to be vested in the major consortium partnerships. Part of this is a problem which the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) has been addressing for the last few years; that is, the lack of aggression on the part of Australian industry to demonstrate that it is really interested in taking risks and putting research and development money into developing the expertise that would encourage overseas interests to target Australian firms with a view to gaining their expertise.
      </para>
      <para>
       One of the problems also encountered was the lack of preparedness on the part of a quite large number of firms in some of the engineering areas to form adequate consortia to utilise the very wide range of skills and expertise that might already exist in part in each of those firms. As continued development takes place on the North West Shelf the challenge really is to demonstrate that they are prepared to do this and that they are competitive with international firms in every aspect. There is a lot of Australian involvement but it is possible to have considerably more. I believe that firms and also unions wish to ensure that the appropriate climate exists to make the development an attractive proposition to consortia such as that on the North West Shelf. I believe also that it is important that the Government provide adequate resources to enable the information flow to come through to the Australian firms so that they are not prejudiced in any way against the possibility of gaining an adequate component.
      </para>
      <para>
       This is the first of what will probably be a continuing series of references on this topic. It is of interest to note that, in one of the newer fields, much the same size development could take place. It is hoped that, when that takes place, Australia will be better placed because of the experience gained to gain a long-term advantage. There is no reason why Australian industry should not become so expert in this field that it will be called upon to go offshore to assist in the development of projects of this kind to a much greater degree than is the case today. Everything is running for us. We have the opportunity to gain experience and understanding. As a result of a report such as this, I believe that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, the unions and industry must now cooperate to ensure that we are well placed to be able to do this.
      </para>
      <para>
       I will not retrace all the recommendations because they have been adequately canvassed by previous speakers. I recommend the report to all honourable members and to those people outside this chamber who are interested in developments such as this so that they may apprise themselves of the difficulties and also the possibilities. This is a major project involving many billions of dollars and it is only one of a number that could be of a similar size. The benefits that flow to Australia should be in exactly those terms-in billions of dollars-in relation to not only royalties but also expertise and the ongoing developmental projects in which we should be able to participate.
      </para>
      <para>
       It was a very interesting inquiry. I thank my colleague the honourable member for Rankin (Mr Beddall) for his leadership and I also thank the members of the secretariat, who have been particularly assiduous in the way in which they have addressed this matter, sometimes against considerable odds, because it was not always possible to get members to the places we had to visit. However, they certainly made an enormous contribution and I believe that the final draft is a credit to them. I issue the challenge that the next one will be equally good and equally useful to Australian industry.

         —by leave-The report I have just tabled relates to the preparation of sites for further developments at Brisbane Airport. These include sites for an international terminal and aviation industry infrastructure. This report is the sixth report presented by the Committee regarding developments at Brisbane Airport since 1979. I should also add that the Committee has spent more time examining this project than any other this year. What appeared on the surface to be a reasonably straightforward project developed into a re-examination of the planning philosophy of the Brisbane Airport and the master plan on which it is based.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Committee is well aware that airports are an extremely sensitive issue in the community and Brisbane is no exception. The Committee recognises that any decision it reaches on this matter is likely to be controversial and arouse strong feelings in the community. Indeed, reflecting this, two members of the Committee have dissented from the final recommendation that the project proceed. The Committee recognises that in many respects future development at Brisbane Airport has been locked in by past developments. The Committee is also conscious that its referral related to a specific project. However, the Committee recognised that the sandfilling project had the possible effect of closing off alternative avenues of development. The Committee therefore took the view that it has a wider responsibility to the Parliament and examined in some detail the basic philosophy of the master plan and issues such as runway directions, length of crosswind runway and noise effects.
       </para>
       <para>
        As part of its examination the Committee undertook detailed inspections of the airport and environs on 25 July and 10 August. These included the proposed site, the existing international terminal, and an aerial inspection which included the airport, the site for the sand dredging at Middle Banks and a simulated instrument approach to the airport. The Committee also travelled to suburbs south of the city to observe aircraft on landing approach and to experience noise levels.
       </para>
       <para>
        On balance, the Committee, with the exception of Senator Burns and Senator Devereux, has, somewhat reluctantly, accepted that the sandfilling project should proceed as proposed by the Federal Airports Corporation. In the report the Committee has recommended that the Federal Airports Corporation should undertake a thorough re-examination of the Brisbane Airport master plan before further runway developments are undertaken. In making this recommendation, the Committee has rejected the proposition that extension of the 14/32 crosswind runway to accept heavier aircraft is not feasible.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee has also drawn attention to the measures being taken to minimise the noise impact of aircraft operations at Brisbane Airport. The Committee is aware of the considerable concern expressed to it by residents' groups and by local Federal and State members on the issue of aircraft noise. In conclusion, I thank all members of the Committee for their contribution to the inquiry, which proved to be an extremely complex and difficult one. I commend the report to the House.

        I was pleased to see that in the Chairman's tabling statement reference was made to the cross-runway and the fact that the Committee was not convinced that the future extension of that runway was not a possibility. I welcome that, in particular, because there is a great deal of concern in Brisbane about the present noise factor and that which will occur in the future development of Brisbane Airport. On all the figures available at the moment, it appears that Brisbane Airport will probably become the second busiest airport in Australia somewhere in the middle of the next decade. The projections by Qantas Airways Ltd and the various tourist organisations around Australia certainly confirm that.

        I have some very deep concerns about what is happening in Brisbane with respect to not only the present development but also the future of the old airport site because there we have the potential for one of the finest airport developments and aviation aerospace developments anywhere in Australia. I hope that, in the dying months of this Government, it will consider that when it looks at the disposal of that old airport site. I know that the new incoming Government, of which I hope to be an integral part, has some great plans for it.

         —It is an honour to be able to lead this debate on the second reading of the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 3) on behalf of the Federal Opposition. I am very pleased to be able to announce that the Opposition will fight this Bill tooth and nail on every possible political platform, and upon our return to government we will repeal this insidious attack on individual rights. It is a classic Bill for a Labor Party administration which believes more in collective rights than in individual rights.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Bill was initiated following a statement from the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) on 18 October 1989 that the Federal Government would move against any State government which tried to implement voluntary student unionism within tertiary institutions in that State. The Minister's proposal comes partly as a response to indications that State governments in New South Wales and Queensland have been seriously considering the introduction of voluntary student unionism. Under the Bill, a State parliament is prevented from outlawing compulsory student unionism and payments to a State are conditional upon that State meeting this Commonwealth condition or requirement.
       </para>
       <para>
        If a State introduces a ban on compulsory student unionism, it may be required to pay an amount equal to the shortfall to the Commonwealth or alternatively the Commonwealth will reduce the State's general revenue assistance. It is then proposed that the Commonwealth will make payments directly to the affected institutions, thus by-passing the States altogether. In other words, if necessary, the Minister would fund his student mates, minority ratbag groups, directly out of Commonwealth funds, out of the pockets of taxpayers, and freeze the States of funding that they would otherwise be entitled to.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has a very clear motivation for this proposal. Firstly, it will be used as a vehicle by the Minister to claim that he is concerned about the autonomy of higher education institutions. Nothing could be further from the truth. No Federal Minister in the history of our Federation has done more than this Minister to undermine the independence and autonomy of our higher education institutions. If the situation were not so serious, it would be laughable for anybody to suggest that this Minister has any interest whatsoever in institutional autonomy. The whole rationale of his policy is that higher education institutions should be under Canberra's thumb more than ever before. The Minister sets the national priorities and requires institutions to comply with them. He has instituted a series of mechanisms to increase his control over universities. I am very pleased also to announce that upon our return to government the coalition will abolish very many of those controls.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister has also announced his intention to introduce a Bill of rights for universities. In the same statement of 18 October 1989 in which the Minister denies students freedom of association, he has the audacity to announce a charter of academic freedom. In doing so, he acknowledges the veracity of the criticism that his higher education policies have compromised academic freedom. Whilst the announcement confirms concerns about centralised control, it is meaningless when, as was pointed out recently by the Vice-Chancellor of Melbourne University, `all the political processes of control remain in place'. The Minister has constantly used the power of the purse to exercise greater controls. As long as the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) is the Minister, we can be sure that he will continually keep a gun at the head of our institutions to whip them into line and to bully them into meeting his policy objectives. The charter, of course, is in similar vein to this legislation. It is a case of the arsonist declaring the need for the fire truck. Let me predict that this conceptually confused policy position from the Minister for Employment, Education and Training will in fact never see the light of day.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second general motivation for this legislation is that the Minister is keen to shore up the support of left wing activists on the campuses in readiness for the forthcoming Federal election. The great majority of student unions in Australia are run by left wingers and, as they control large amounts of compulsorily collected student funds, it is important for the Minister for Employment, Education and Training to have their support. He will need all the support he can find. As an example the National Union of Students, the peak body which represents about 43 of the 68 individual campus unions, will campaign actively for the Labor Party in the forthcoming Federal election, and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training is hopeful that this legislation will prop up his standing with those groups.
       </para>
       <para>
        Compulsory student unionism was guaranteed by the Whitlam Government in 1973. Student union fees are collected by the university administrations and can amount to $300 per annum per student. In 1989, more than $30m has been collected in compulsory union membership fees. Student unions undertake a number of activities. Firstly, they provide a range of services, including catering, cinemas, child-care, legal aid services, et cetera; secondly, they provide political functions, including the running of newspapers and radio stations, and they provide financial assistance to clubs and societies; thirdly, they act as the representative of students in dealings with university administrations, faculties, departments, et cetera; and, fourthly, they supply the funds for various sporting facilities and organisations on campus.
       </para>
       <para>
        The proponents of compulsory student unionism claim that universal membership ensures that the unions are representative and that the consequent collective strength gives them the capacity to stand against the unreasonable policy positions of governments and, presumably, of university administrations. These proponents claim that tertiary campuses are like small towns and, therefore, they need certain access to revenue to provide the services which are allegedly of benefit, either directly or indirectly, to all campus members. It is argued that fees are collected from all and then passed on to student unions, with all expenditure being overseen by student representatives elected by the student body. It is argued that, like taxation-this is a favourite analogy made by proponents of compulsory student unionism-this works on the principle that all students benefit from the common pooling of resources. These proponents also claim that on-campus trading operations are sort of inherently unprofitable and that, therefore, if voluntary student unionism was introduced, either services would be reduced or costs would be greatly increased. As I say, that is a favourite scare campaign tactic used by proponents on campuses.

        The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee (AVCC) joins forces with the proponents of compulsory student unionism. University administrators seem very happy to be the bagmen to extract these fees compulsorily and to pass them on to student unions. AVCC members claim that all students benefit from such arrangements and that, therefore, all students should pay. That is an argument that, for example, was put in a submission to the New South Wales Government in August last year and received the endorsement of the University of Sydney, amongst others. The university specifically endorsed the tax analogy argument on the basis that the services provided are essential services from which all benefit in their academic life-an interesting claim, I must say, given the sorts of services that are provided. Unfortunately, the university has not gone on to give us some clarification as to how it might substantiate that rather absurd argument. It supported the extraordinary claim that such bodies provide students `with an avenue for learning management skills and developing qualities of leadership'-which should bring a smile even to the face of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand)-and supported the claim that an administrative nightmare would follow the end of compulsory student unionism. Of course, it failed to explain how catering services could possibly be described as essential or of benefit in academic life and it failed to address one of the difficult arguments for the proponents, that is, whether or not these services are in fact a public good of the type provided by councils, such as roads or garbage collection, as opposed to luxuries, which I would advance are what in fact the major services provided by such organisations are.

        The coalition parties object to compulsory student unionism on the ground of principle and on the ground of efficient management. Apart from the important and fundamental objections to compulsory student unionism on the philosophical level, the undemocratic nature of compulsory student unionism contradicts the spirit of free inquiry, association and interaction which should form the heart of all higher education institutions. Compulsory student unionism is an affront to those of us who believe in the concept of freedom of association. Australia is a signatory to a number of international agreements that specifically outlaw compulsory unionism. Let me name three: the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Labour Organisation's Convention on the Freedom of Association and the Protection of the Right to Organise. These conventions all support the policy position adopted by the Opposition and we in the Opposition believe that they, in themselves and on their own, represent an unarguable case against compulsory student unionism.

        Some will claim-and the AVCC stands with those-that somehow student unionism is different from trade unionism and that this somehow justifies their position. Let me acknowledge that student unions may be different in character, but they are still unions; people are still compulsorily required to subscribe to them.

One of the sad things about the Labor Government is that after seven years it has given up the real policy debate; it has given up the hard tasks of actually arguing for its position. The superficiality of what was said by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs is just a sad, pitiful indictment of the Government of which he is a member.

        Student unions, as with trade unions, which require the compulsory payment of fees are an affront to the concept of freedom of association and, in our view, the principle of freedom of association has an application beyond the industrial movement. The Australian Labor Party likes to claim that the Opposition's dislike of compulsory unionism is somehow translated into opposition against all unionism, as the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs so predictably exhibited just a moment ago. Let me make it quite clear that the Opposition wholeheartedly supports the concept of freedom of association and it totally endorses the right of individuals to establish organisations for political or other reasons. No wonder the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs is so embarrassed. With the pilots dispute, so determined was the Government to make the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) the Ronald Reagan of the Antipodes or the Margaret Thatcher equivalent, it was prepared to dump on a principle on which a few years ago the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, as a left winger with some conscience before the trappings of power got to him, would have stood with the Opposition on the basic question of freedom of association.

        The coalition does not accept the differences as argued by the AVCC and, not surprisingly, in keeping with our industrial relations policy we will also outlaw compulsory trade unionism. The constant claim of proponents of compulsory student unionism is that their services could not be provided more cheaply or more efficiently by an alternative system. This amounts to a perverse admission that student services are demonstrably inefficient. They say that if the students do not have to pay then no-one will pay, which of course means that what student unions offer is not sufficiently attractive to encourage people to pay voluntarily. When it comes to trade unionism, Bill Kelty himself is constantly recognising that his membership falls because trade unions do not offer what their members are looking for.

        Student services suffer from all the same problems of monopolies. Generally student union services have a monopoly in as much as they command a venue on campus which gives them the advantage of location. They have little competition. Who would walk off campus for a cup of coffee when they can get one on campus? Therefore, student union services do not receive any reward for more efficient practices. Their industrial relations record exhibits a tendency to award pace-setting salaries and conditions for the simple reason that they can pass on the additional cost to their captive consumers. Similarly with newspapers, if somebody is running a student newspaper and the union pays a subsidy regardless of the quality of the production, then obviously there is no incentive to do better. Indeed, it becomes incumbent just to churn out leftist propaganda to maintain the subsidy vital to survival.

         —There is little wonder that often university union newspapers are seen blowing in the wind around campuses or sitting in unopened piles awaiting their trip to the tip. The proponents of compulsory student unionism say that the real issue is who should control the delivery of services. Their answer is that it is either the university administration, private enterprise for profit or-their preferred answer-students acting on behalf of all students. Of course, the real answer is none of those. The real answer is that the control of delivery of services should be in the hands of the consumers of the services. The University of Queensland Union is a recent example where it has been shown that huge savings can be made as a result of much more effective administration. In 1989 the new Liberal-National coalition student group turned in a $300,000 profit-a remarkable achievement after only eight or nine months of operation, especially when compared with the $45 profit made by that union in 1988, when it was controlled by the ALP on campus.

        I will respond to the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth), who referred to newspapers. A similar success story can be found at the Australian National University with the Grunion newspaper. The editors have successfully sold advertising space and are now offering a newspaper that people actually want to read. Instead of being a drain on the general student body, the newspaper runs not only without subsidy but also at a profit. With cafeteria services the fact is that in most urban universities people can walk off the campus to the nearest milk bar and obtain sandwiches and the like for the same price or less than the subsidised product in the university. At the ANU, which is an urban university, privatisation of certain trading facilities, for example, a bakery, newsagent and coffee lounge, has resulted in quality services being offered at competitive prices without the need for a subsidy.

        Compulsory student unionism and its attendant service monopolies prohibit competition. Competition provides incentives to maximise efficiencies and allows students the freedom to decide how they spend their own money. Not only are many of these unions notoriously inefficient, but also they have been the vehicles for abuses of the trust placed in student leaders to supervise properly the use of these funds. Funds are provided for a range of clubs and societies, many of which pursue political causes which would be anathema to most students. A recent decision of the Victorian Equal Opportunities Board ruled that Mr Stephen Kenmar, a student who objected to compulsory student unionism, was effectively deprived of his political rights as a result of the political leanings of the Monash Association of Students. Those who support this Bill support that point stated by the Victorian Equal Opportunities Board, that is, the deprivation of political rights. In the 1960s and 1970s the Australian Union of Students took on a number of minority causes. Compulsorily levied funds were used to support the Palestine Liberation Organisation and other terrorist groups. These very unpopular policy decisions helped to bring about the demise of the Australian Union of Students, but this sort of funding continues.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, the National Union of Students will be encouraged by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training to use some of its $600,000 war chest to fund marginal seat campaigns for the Federal ALP in the forthcoming election. This would parallel a decision by the same group to spend $50,000 to campaign against the Liberal- National Party coalition at the last New South Wales State election. Other examples of expenditure to which all students have been obliged to contribute include the following: in 1985, Monash University Students Union, $2,993 for a lesbian and gay men's information and resource booklet; to add injury to insult, in 1986 a further $2,810 for a reprint; $1,761 for a sexuality festival; and $3,200 for Palestinian awareness; in 1986, Melbourne University Students Representative Council, $187 for sexual harassment week, $600 for peace week and $167 for an SRC officer to attend the ALP conference in Hobart; in 1987, $4,065 in conference fares, including the Australian Fabians Conference and conferences against privatisation and tertiary fees; in 1987 Curtin University of Technology, $35,000 for a boycott of the higher education admission charge and $2,000 to the homosexual information office; in 1986, Adelaide University Students Union, $4,000 for a Canberra lobbyist. At the University of Queensland the cost of the subsidies for the radical 4ZZZ was in the vicinity of $110,000 in one year alone. On occasions this radio collective has refused student input. It is using student money but refusing student input. Most of its fanatical supporters are non-student members of the Socialist Workers Party. And members on the Government side support that!
       </para>
       <para>
        The issue is not whether gays and lesbians on campus, men opposed to patriarchy, the South African Liberation Centre or the Palestinian group are worthy of support. The question those opposite have to answer when they stand is whether or not students should be compulsorily levied to pay for causes which they may not support, or causes to which they are entitled in a democracy to be opposed. Whilst the student unions claim to be representative, it is rare for more than 20 per cent or 25 per cent of the student body actually to vote in student elections. The funds that are made available, and which are collected from the whole of the student body, are concentrated in the hands of a minority, elected by a minority, who are very vocal in defence of their own privileged feather-nested positions as a result of compulsory student unionism.

       <para>
        The coalition's policy is very clear. Unlike the Government, it has a very wide range of policies for the people at the next election-in fact over 30. We will move decisively in this area to legislate for voluntary student unionism. We accept the proposition underlying the Minister's proposal that it is reasonable for the Commonwealth to use the section 96 procedure under the Constitution to require the States to act in a particular way. The Minister proposes that they desist from outlawing compulsory student unionism, whereas by contrast the coalition insists that they introduce voluntary student unionism. One alternative which has been before the coalition is to introduce voluntary student unionism in respect of the political activities of student unions, but to allow the compulsory payment of fees in respect of sporting and welfare activities. We have considered that alternative and I announce that we have come to the view that it is not a viable alternative.
       </para>
       <para>
        Sporting facilities are important to many students but not all students, particularly part-time and mature age students, would obtain benefits either directly or indirectly from them. Sports clubs ought to be self-financing in the same way as similar amateur clubs outside the campus. Sponsorship for these clubs is an option that should be investigated. Not surprisingly with compulsory fees, those options and the possibilities of raising other revenue outside the university have not been fully exploited.
       </para>
       <para>
        The cancer of compulsory student unionism must be cut out in full. It would be a futile exercise to remove the more obvious malignancies but leave enough to again threaten the student body. Recent history shows that the proponents of voluntary student unionism must act with complete determination to eradicate this blot on the rights of individuals and this affront to the spirit of free inquiry which should pervade all of our higher education institutions.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conclusion I pay tribute to the thousands upon thousands of students who have stood up for this basic principle-people such as Robert Clark, John Bell, Julian Sheezel, Sophie Panopolous, Paul Stevenage, Stephen Kenmar, Gerard Wheeler, Brendan Harradine, Darren Olney, Norman Moore, James Duncan, Michael Kroger, Peter Costello, Michael Yabsley and the many others who have resisted compulsion. Their efforts will be rewarded-they will be rewarded shortly after the coalition is returned to the Treasury bench at the forthcoming election early in 1990.
       </para>
       <para>
        I reiterate that the coalition opposes this Bill. We will oppose with all of our political determination and acknowledged campaigning skills. We look forward to the abolition of this insidious attack on individual rights and we look forward to the introduction of voluntary student unionism in the first half of 1990.

So the shadow education portfolio has ended up in the hands of the honourable member for Flinders and, as a result, we witnessed the quality of the speech he made today. It was typified by the usual knee-jerk, conservative reaction to the mention of the word `union', even in relation to a student union. Whenever they hear those words, members of the Opposition immediately start frothing at the mouth and coming out with all of the old platitudes, and again this is disappointing because I thought that the Opposition had a somewhat more sophisticated and rather more objective view these days about unionism and worker and student representation. It appears, of course, that that is not the case.

        The honourable member for Flinders said that the Opposition will fight this Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill tooth and nail. I can assure members of the Opposition that that is something which we on this side of the House look forward to with great relish. The honourable member mentioned that the Bill pandered to what he called the student mates of the Government, the minority ratbag groups and various other insidious elements in universities. As far as I am concerned, and I am sure that my colleagues on this side of the House agree, some of the most insidious groups in the student body in various universities are made up by the members of the various cells of Liberal Youth which seem to flourish in universities and are no doubt behind quite a good deal of the information in the speech delivered today by the honourable member for Flinders.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill in no way legislates for compulsory student unionism. It simply legislates to allow higher education institutions to choose whether or not unionism will be compulsory and to choose how they run their own affairs. That is in no way inconsistent with the general attitude and general policy that this Government has been demonstrating towards higher education institutions. With all of the revolutionary changes that have taken place in higher education policy, it has been uppermost that higher education institutions maintain their autonomy in the running of their internal affairs and particular autonomy in academic freedom.
       </para>
       <para>
        What we are not allowing universities to do is remain totally unaccountable for their expenditure of taxpayers' funds which we the Government, courtesy of the taxpayers, give them. We are saying that the universities must be efficient and responsible and that they must expend taxpayers' funds responsibly and efficiently and must be accountable for them. We are not in any way interfering with academic freedom, involving courses, or the internal administration of universities.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill is in no way inconsistent with the Government's general policy on higher education. It has been a fundamental thrust of Government policy to guarantee academic freedom and to protect the autonomy of higher education institutions. In particular, the Commonwealth is not prepared to allow State governments to intrude into the legitimate affairs of those institutions and their governing bodies and student organisations. In the last few months there has been evidence of some State government intrusion, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland-and it is not surprising that they are the States we are talking about. They are trying to intrude into internal university matters and, in particular, to abolish compulsory student unionism. Institutions currently impose and collect fees on behalf of student unions. Under the proposed State legislation in New South Wales in particular this would be prohibited.
       </para>
       <para>
        We know that, of recent years in particular, student unions provide a range of services to the students whom they represent. They provide some very important and very fundamental services. The honourable member for Flinders gave a very selective list of the ways in which student money has been spent but he did not mention the essential counselling services connected with students' academic careers, their careers in general and certain family, social or psychological problems-services that are essential to their welfare and success at university. These are the services that are being provided by student unions using union fees.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are various other services, such as sporting, health and career services and the necessary social outlets needed by young people in higher education institutions. They are essential and are being provided by student unions; therefore the student unions need all the support they can get. The threatened State government intervention would destroy many of those services and the institutions themselves do not have sufficient resources to offset this loss of fee income for the student unions. The Bill will ensure that the basic rights of institutions to provide for the welfare of their students is not jeopardised by the action being taken by some States to destroy the unions financially.
       </para>
       <para>
        The measures that we intend to take to ensure that this will be the case are as follows. If a State chooses to legislate in this way-and we cannot stop State governments from doing this-the Commonwealth will provide funding for student unions in the grants to institutions to compensate the unions for any loss of income from union fees. If the Commonwealth is required to compensate unions or institutions in this way, the Commonwealth will recover the cost through an adjustment of the general revenue grants the States receive through the Premiers Conference. These are measures that we are able to take to ensure that the universities and the students in particular do not suffer from this intrusion by the State governments.

        The honourable member for Flinders spoke at great length about freedom of association for students. I would like to talk about another freedom which students should have but would not have under a coalition government, and that is the freedom to get to a higher education institution in the first place. What opportunity would young people have for education with the Opposition's proposed $1,200 up-front fee? That is a massive onus to place on students at the beginning of an academic year. It is totally inequitable because the burden would fall most heavily on those students least able to afford it-that is, students from low income families.
       </para>
       <para>
        Unlike the Opposition's policy, the Government's current system of higher education fees is quite equitable. Last year we introduced the higher education contribution scheme (HECS), otherwise known as the tertiary or graduate tax. At that time, understandably, some legitimate concerns were expressed at what effect it would have on students, particularly on student enrolments. It was suggested that the scheme would be a disincentive for students to take part in higher education. Figures on student enrolments which have come out since then do not bear that out. For example, it was considered that the HECS would lead to falling enrolments, falling commencements, a fall in the number of part time students, particularly female students, and a fall in the number of postgraduate and higher degree students. As it has turned out, that is not the case.
       </para>
       <para>
        The higher education student population preliminary figure for 1989 is 445,000, which represents an increase of 24,600, or 5.8 per cent, on the 1988 figure. It is the second highest annual growth rate since 1975. Full time enrolments are estimated to be up by 19,800, or 7.8 per cent, in 1989. Part time and external enrolments have risen by 3 per cent and 2.4 per cent respectively. The proportion of female students has increased from 51.1 per cent to 52.1 per cent. In 1989 total commencements are up by 12,300, or 7.3 per cent, and higher degree commencements are up by 17 per cent. This contrasts with the estimate earlier this year of only a one per cent increase in higher degree commencements.
       </para>
       <para>
        While it now appears that the HECS may have had some impact on external students, the system as a whole has experienced substantial growth. Full time student numbers in particular have maintained their rapid rate of increase. Both higher degree and undergraduate numbers are up significantly. Later in the year the Government will have more detailed and accurate figures. One can see that the predictions of the opponents of HECS that enrolments and commencements would fall drastically this year as a result of some alleged disincentive have not been fulfilled.
       </para>
       <para>
        I repeat the reasons that we introduced the higher education contribution scheme. Up until now there were not enough places in tertiary education institutions for those who needed them. In the 1980s there has not been the evidence that young people from lower income families and state schools are entering universities in the proportion that they should. The money acquired from the higher education contribution scheme will be used to fund more places so that more young people will be able to get into tertiary institutions. It will also enable us to pay more by way of Austudy. We will be able to extend the eligibility for Austudy and increase the rates of Austudy, which is of inestimable value to secondary students who are coming up to the tertiary education years and to lower income tertiary students who need income support while they are studying.
       </para>
       <para>
        I repeat that the Opposition's policy of a $1,200 fee paid up-front every year would be a massive burden on the students I have been talking about. The honourable member for Flinders talked about the freedom of students to associate. I say to him: what about the freedom of young people to enter a tertiary institution in the first place? That freedom, that opportunity, that they have under us with the assistance that we provide would not exist under a coalition government when a massive $1,200 fee would have to be paid up-front. The Opposition talks about having scholarships for 25 per cent of students. That means that we would revert to the old system in the pre-Whitlam days when to get to university a person had to be either rich or good at passing exams. I think everybody agreed that that was not an equitable system. The present system gives all students an equal opportunity to enter a tertiary institution. What we say is that afterwards, when they graduate and are earning a reasonable salary, they should pay back over a number of years one-fifth of the cost of their tertiary education. I do not believe that that is an unreasonable measure to take.
       </para>
       <para>
        I fully support the Bill which legislates to prevent State governments intruding into the internal affairs of tertiary institutions, particularly the way in which they organise their student unions. I look forward, as do my colleagues, to watching the Opposition fighting the Bill tooth and nail, as the honourable member for Flinders said. I look forward to hearing what the Opposition's next speaker presents to us.

         —Despite the understanding-if that is the right word-of the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Harvey), the apparently innocuous title of this Bill belies what is in fact a very important and utterly disgraceful attempt by the Federal Government to deny students freedom of association while attending tertiary institutions. The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 3) seeks to use Federal financial powers under section 96 of the Constitution to prevent State governments from legislating to ensure that membership of student unions and associations is truly voluntary. Although the Bill might be seen as an abuse of Commonwealth power, it is not the matter of so-called States rights which is at issue but the freedom for individual students to choose to join, or not to join, student associations. The Bill seeks to deny those rights on entirely spurious grounds.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Labor Government is abusing the power of the Parliament to reward and further the interests of its own political supporters at the expense of the liberty of all and, in particular, the freedom of those students who have no desire to be involved in political games which are an integral part of student unions. At present in this country the right to freedom of association is effectively denied to many Australians through both industrial law and practices and compulsory membership of student associations. These abuses are clearly in contravention of such widely accepted accounts of human rights as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which in Article 20 states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.
       </para>
       <para>
        No-one may be compelled to belong to an association.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia is a signatory to that declaration. Industrial law imposes compulsion through the practice of the closed shop and through preference clauses in industrial relations Acts which deny employment to people who wish to choose not to join a union.
       </para>
       <para>
        The system of registration of trade unions and employer groups also denies the freedom to form an association to those in the industrial arena. I have spoken about these issues in the House previously, only to hear a response from members opposite which either denies in the face of all evidence to the contrary the reality of forced membership or seeks to justify such an abhorrent practice by reference to euphemistic industrial relations realities. These so-called realities have condemned this country to declining industry, declining standards of living, and the economic mess we face after too many years of Labor rule.
       </para>
       <para>
        The position with student associations is an even more blatant denial of the essential liberty of freedom of association. State government legislation which establishes tertiary institutions and Federal Government legislation for institutions in the Territories enforce compulsory membership of student associations through both forced membership and coerced fees collected on behalf of the student associations. The Federal Government does not have direct constitutional power to legislate for the establishment of universities in the States and their structures. However, this legislation will use Federal financial powers to prevent State governments implementing legislation, if they are of a mind at any time in the future to remove the compulsory membership of student associations. Indeed, the mechanism of this proposed legislation is curious. It involves quite extraordinary incentives for student unions to seek and gain government funding while granting the Minister for Employment, Education and Training unusual and excessive discretionary powers in determining the application of this legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill is envisaged as a pre-emptive strike against State governments which might consider the introduction of legislation to guarantee freedom of association in tertiary institutions. The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simmons), on behalf of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), in his second reading speech said that he hopes that this Bill will intimidate State Ministers sufficiently to ensure that `the provisions of this Bill will never need to be invoked'. If they are invoked, then the legislation will require State governments to pay student unions an amount to be determined by the Federal Minister to make up for the loss in revenue from students choosing not to join the association concerned. This is an extraordinary way of going about what is really a rather tawdry exercise in coercing students. This Bill allows the Minister unlimited discretion to determine the amount by which student associations will be compensated. It will effectively reward the most incompetent student unions, which will lose the largest number of members if membership becomes voluntary.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill will deny students the economic benefits of voluntary membership by removing the incentives of greater efficiency and better service from student unions. If this Bill comes into effect, far from providing a guarantee of institutional autonomy, it will make student unions a dependent client of the Federal Minister. The Minister is already bowing down to the vested interests of the few who gain from their participation in student associations at the expense of the many who have other priorities when they study at university.
       </para>
       <para>
        For a very short Bill, this piece of legislation is an example of many of the worst features of government decisions under Labor, such as pandering to vested interests, extending ministerial discretion to avoid parliamentary scrutiny, economic irrationality, abuse of Commonwealth powers, and trampling on the rights and freedoms of individuals. For these reasons, I suggest that the Bill is fundamentally flawed and should be rejected, no matter what members think of the principles behind the Bill. However, those principles are important, and I will go on to discuss them in some detail before refuting some of the most common myths about student unions and the provision of services for students. Freedom of association cannot be a conditional freedom, to be granted by permission of the Government and denied if that permission is not forthcoming. However, that is the form of limited freedom which exists for so many today in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commonwealth Government has established privileged private associations and adds to frequent government subsidy and patronage by granting them monopoly rights in their fields. There is only one official representative of students on campuses, just as there is only one major registered union in most industries in Australia and only one official political party in less democratic countries than ours. Liberty to join or not to join these associations cannot be conditional upon the acceptance of that association, as it is under most schemes for so-called conscientious objection in Australia. True freedom of association should surely be a simple matter of choice. The question `Would you like to join?', answered `Yes' or `No', is the essence of that freedom. The ability to avoid otherwise compulsory membership is not the same as the liberty to choose membership, which all Australians should have. Australian students at tertiary institutions do not have that liberty. The payment of fees to student associations is a precondition of enrolment at universities across the country. If the fee is not paid, then the opportunity for higher education is denied. The fee does not pay for a student's education or for essential services provided by the university, but pays for a range of services, facilities and subsidies to other students which are by no means necessary for an education.
       </para>
       <para>
        Virtually all the functions performed by student unions can be provided privately on a fee-for-service basis. Many facilities, such as catering, are provided already near the campuses at a higher quality and more competitive price by private traders. Compulsory union fees have allowed student associations to become an inefficient burden on the lives of many students. The existence of subsidy through the fee makes the trading operations of the student associations inefficient and leads to the provision of services which are desired by few, if any. It has already led to the politicising of these associations as one gang or another seeks to control the resources of the student unions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The provision for conscientious objection at some universities, which is opposed by most Labor governments in any case, changes none of this. In most cases the students must pay their money to a charity or some other group instead of the union. In other cases the money is paid to the student association by the university, regardless of whether the student is a member. This is not a substitute for freedom of association, but rather a form of fine for those who do not want to be members of student associations. Conscientious objection is a perversion of free association. It represents a concession to vested interests which, while apparently innocuous, is a running sore on the face of Australian democracy. Many members opposite took pride in their stance against conscription to fight in the Vietnam War. They claimed then that conscientious objection did not reduce the evil of conscription. However, when their own and their supporters' interests are challenged, they are quite willing to entrench the conscription of students as members of student unions, using the feeble defence that conscientious objection caters for the dissenters.
       </para>
       <para>
        Despite the rationalising by university administrators defending their acquiescence in the forcing of students to pay fees to the student unions, the fee is not primarily a fee for services and amenities but is a compulsory fee collected for the benefit of a student union which happens to provide some services and amenities. All of these services can and should be provided on a user pays basis. Students should not be forced to pay for the leisure of other students or to fund a political training ground for those who have come to dominate the student unions.
       </para>
       <para>
        On top of this, students are also likely to be paying for their affiliation with a national student union and a range of other organisations with which their campus student union is involved. I am sure that many members are aware of the abuses of student funds, which have become legion under the regime of compulsory membership of student unions. Donations to the Palestine Liberation Organisation and other terrorist organisations, as well as support for numerous extremist causes which are not relevant to most students, have been well documented by a source as credible as the Australian Labor Party candidate for Goldstein, Mr Michael Danby, who has written:
       </para>
       <para>
        Why the establishment seemed so unwilling to permit freedom of association for students, either on individual campuses or nationally (and the one necessarily implied the other), remains a mystery to many . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Danby's principled position is an indication that this is certainly not a partisan issue. The students who find compulsion most distasteful are usually those who dislike politics in general, regardless of whether it is a product of the Liberal Party or the Labor Party and their supporters. The defence of compulsion is usually clothed in arguments which barely cover the naked self-interest of those promoting them. The first of these myths is that because of the free rider problem all students should be forced to contribute equally to the student union. In fact, the free riders are those involved in so-called student politics and those who make extensive use of a union's facilities. Their activities are at present largely dependent on the forced contributions of those who do not wish to use those facilities.
       </para>
       <para>
        We all benefit from the voluntary actions of some private associations and are all damaged by the activities of others. But we are not forced to make contributions to, for example, the various automobile associations, despite the benefits which they provide for all road users. Nor are those who do not join a private association in any meaningful sense free riders when that association can easily ensure that the benefits of the association are restricted to members.
       </para>
       <para>
        In his second reading speech, the Minister lists a number of services which student unions provide. It is a somewhat idealised list of what is important in the operations of student unions, but none of the functions which he lists, and no conceivable functions, would justify forced membership and forced contributions. We can dismiss the free rider fallacy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another defence of compulsion is the assertion that a student union is like a government and therefore should be compulsory. It is not. The very suggestion that some students should have the right to govern others is both ridiculous and offensive.
       </para>
       <para>
        The President of the National Union of Students has argued that the issue of voluntary membership is secondary to the question of who should control student services. Apart from the incorrect assumption that someone must control a monopoly on those services, that argument assumes that there is so little demand for the services which student unions provide that they would not exist if they were not forced on students. A number of studies make it quite clear that the provision of most services for students on campuses can be funded on a user pays basis or through the private sector.
       </para>
       <para>
        The defence of compulsion, which is necessary to justify this legislation, ultimately rests on the assertion that Australian university students are not able to make independent decisions about how to look after themselves and how to spend their own money. It asserts that some students should be placed in a privileged position in relation to that of their colleagues, having the government-granted right to force other students to join their association. However, compulsion is unjustified.
       </para>
       <para>
        Why then is there no attempt to justify this abuse of power by the Commonwealth Government in this legislation? The answer is that the Minister has chosen to use surreptitious and dishonest means to achieve his end. He argues that for a State government to legislate for guarantees of freedom of association for students is to interfere in the autonomy of higher education institutions. One could be forgiven for thinking that this argument is just a sick joke from the Minister who, more than any other Federal Minister, has made universities a creature of his whim and his Department.
       </para>
       <para>
        Universities do not have the autonomy to infringe the rights and freedoms of their students. At present compulsion is enforced through provisions in government legislation which establishes those institutions. If genuine autonomy is granted to those institutions within the rule of law, and in accordance with the general principles which should apply to all citizens, then compulsory membership of student unions could not continue.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Federal Government does not have the constitutional power directly to enforce compulsory membership of student unions. However, it is willing to do whatever it can to uphold this abhorrent practice through this legislation. To conclude, I would like to quote a past student who has written:
       </para>
       <para>
        Compulsory student unionism provides the vast majority of students with few, if any, benefits. It works upon a political model to which many students are opposed, and helps unrepresentative extremists. It can not be justified in theory or practice and does nothing but harm. It is unethical. It damages the whole concept of democratic society, especially because the group it affects, that is, university students, tends to pass into influential positions in the community.

         —I support the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 3). I have been present during the debate here and have listened to Opposition speakers today. I think there may be some element of misunderstanding or confusion about the intent and nature of this legislation before the House. Put very simply, the legislation is about reducing, diminishing, government control over institutions. It is very much aimed at providing institutions themselves with the autonomy and right to make their own decisions in relation to these matters.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The remarks of Opposition speakers here today represent something of a paradox. Their rhetoric on autonomy, freedom of speech and economic issues like deregulation is very strong indeed but when it comes to the crunch one would have to describe them as the great pretenders. In their contributions to the debate they said that they want and support the heavy hand of government interference-in this case, State government interference-to determine which institutions can or cannot raise money from students for the legitimate purpose of providing services for those students. That is what members of the Opposition have said in this debate today. There should not be any mistake about it. Basically members of the Opposition have said that they support, in this particular instance, the New South Wales State Government in broad brush legislation proscribing certain activities by higher education institutions.
       </para>
       <para>
        What the Commonwealth Labor Government is saying is totally consistent with everything that we have done in higher education since being elected in 1983. We are saying that the decisions about student fees, student unions and student associations should be decisions for the institutions themselves to make. The Opposition's rhetoric on all of these liberal values-autonomy, free speech, deregulation, letting the people decide-is strong but today it is fundamentally asserting that it supports the heavy hand of government interference, prescribing and proscribing what can and cannot be done by institutions in a particular State in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        What the Government is laying down in this legislation is very simple. Unlike what was alleged by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), there is no devious intent; it is a very simple, straightforward piece of legislation. We are providing the right for institutions themselves to determine whether a student union fee should be raised.
       </para>
       <para>
        The previous speaker spoke at some length about the purposes for which student union fees can or cannot be used. But the fact is that those fees provide a very wide range of services for students. In all likelihood those services would simply not be available if those fees were not raised because institutions do not have buckets full of money sitting around in academic theatres and in lecture rooms waiting to be spent. They do not have unlimited access to financial resources.
       </para>
       <para>
        If those fees were not available a range of services, such as counselling services, sporting facilities, health services, assistance with accommodation and emergency accommodation for students in need and career services would not be available. A range of services which provide necessary social outlets for young people are provided in institutions. I repeat: if the legislation which is being proposed by one State government-I might say by only one State government-is passed and those institutions do not have the capacity to raise those resources, students will be denied a range of services which are important to their ongoing success and achievement in higher education. This Bill is about protecting the basic rights of institutions. It ensures that institutions will be able to provide for the welfare of their students. It will ensure that their autonomy is not jeopardised by the heavy-handed actions of State governments with an ideological agenda.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill touches on other issues of great importance to education and higher education. In an earlier contribution today, the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Harvey) explained some of those issues extremely well and extremely succinctly. This Government has a record of which it can be rightly proud in higher education. Recent statistics released about higher education confirm the success of this Government's policies. For instance, this year the number of students starting higher education degrees-that is, masters and doctorate courses-in Australian universities and colleges increased by 17 per cent. So much for the claims often made by Opposition members about the serious problems relating to higher degrees and research in Australia. The fact is that this year there is a 17 per cent increase in the number of students starting higher degrees.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the total higher education sector there are also statistics which totally debunk the claims that the higher education contribution scheme introduced by this Government has turned students away from enrolling in universities and colleges. This year about 445,000 students enrolled in Australian higher education courses-that is an increase of about 25,000 students or 6 per cent on last year's figure. It is the second highest growth rate in 15 years-since 1975. Full time enrolments are up by 8 per cent. Part time and external enrolments are up by 3 per cent and female enrolments have also increased. The recent funding that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), who is in the chamber listening to this debate, has announced for the next triennium-1989 to 1991-will ensure that there is funding for an additional 49,000 places. That will ensure further healthy increases in enrolments in the years to come.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Hawker in her contribution mentioned the Opposition's policy in relation to higher education. She referred to the Opposition's Economic Action Plan policy to introduce a $1,200 up-front fee for any student wanting to participate in higher education. It is somewhat ironic to hear Opposition members in this debate talk about the so-called rights of students to participate in student union activity and to contribute financially to those activities when, under its recently announced Economic Action Plan, a large number of students simply will not have the opportunity to participate in higher education because of the $1,200 up-front fee. Let me go back through these statistics.

He can justify it to the students in his electorate of Lowe and he can tell people from working class families that if they want to go on to higher education his Government will charge them $1,200 up-front; not to be paid later; not means tested and not income tested. That is what the Opposition says in its policy.

       <para>
        This Government has been honest enough to say that it believes students should contribute to higher education. We had the political courage to make a decision to introduce the higher education administration charge some years ago. That was a $250 charge. It was an up-front fee. We have now replaced that with the higher education contribution scheme. One of the reasons we replaced the higher education administration charge-HEAC, the $250 up-front charge-with the contribution scheme, which is an income tested, pay later scheme, was that there was evidence that students were turning away from higher education because they had to pay that modest amount of $250. There was evidence that this was occurring amongst the very people that I am sure all of us in this Parliament would want to see participating in higher education-people who have not had the opportunity before, people from low income families. Even with a fee of $250 there was evidence that people were being turned away and discouraged from continuing on to higher education. So we abolished that charge and we introduced the contribution scheme, which is an income tested, pay later scheme. No-one is forced to pay up- front. People do not repay a cent under that contribution scheme until their income exceeds a certain level in the future-about the figure of average weekly earnings.
       </para>
       <para>
        If one looks at the statistics which I have explained and tabled in this House today on higher education growth since we introduced the contribution scheme one sees that the number of people starting masters and doctorate courses is up by 17 per cent this year. We have never had increases of that dimension before. Despite the higher education contribution fee, regular full time enrolments in higher education are up by 8 per cent this year. Perhaps `despite' is not the right word, because we should never forget that every cent and dollar raised from the higher education contribution scheme goes back into funding more places in higher education. It goes back to provide new opportunities for the 49,000 extra places that will be available to young Australians over the next triennium.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that, if the Opposition's $1,200 proposal is ever introduced, it will be the biggest single disincentive that has ever been put in place and that it will limit young people's access to higher education in Australia. I represent a provincial electorate based on Bendigo and the towns of Maryborough, St Arnaud, Charlton and Wedderburn, in other words, a large number of rural people. If they send their child to college or university, invariably the child must live away from home. Despite the large increases made by this Government to Austudy, the fact is that, if parents lives in the bush and send their child to college or university in Melbourne, they can expect to pay between $5,000 and $10,000 per annum to assist and support that child. Even if they are undertaking some part time work or have some Austudy allowance, that is about what it costs a parent to send a child to university or college in Melbourne.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government wants to increase that $5,000 to $6,200. It wants $1,200 to be put up-front, which is a further impost on these children from the bush who want to participate in higher education. The statistics demonstrate that, when this Government was elected, young people from the bush were three times less likely to participate in higher education than their city cousins. We have put in place a range of programs to improve the prospects of those children. I am pleased to say that we are improving the prospects of young people from country areas. But it is absolute lunacy to suggest that an opposition party with a rural rump, the National Party, should support a policy to impose on young country people around Australia a $1,200 up-front fee.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Government has an outstanding record in education and I want to acknowledge the outstanding contributions made in that regard by the current Minister for Employment, Education and Training and his predecessor, Senator Susan Ryan. Under this Government, in the schools area the retention rate has increased from 36 per cent to more than 60 per cent. As the Minister noted yesterday during Question time, when we were elected in 1983 the number of apprenticeship positions was 35,000, but that number has been increased to more than 60,000 this year, so we have almost doubled the number of apprenticeship positions for young people. We introduced the traineeship scheme and the number of traineeships in Australia now amounts to 17,000. With that figure and the increased number of apprentices, about 45,000 more young people now enjoy training opportunities through apprenticeship or traineeship programs.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1983 we had 350,000 students in higher education in Australia, and this year that number will have increased to 450,000, which is an increase of 100,000 students. To put that increase in perspective, that is equivalent to building about 30 new colleges of advanced education of the size of the Bendigo College of Advanced Education. In seven years we have built 30 new colleges to accommodate 100,000 extra students. We have dramatically increased Austudy. When we were elected 53,000 young people received benefits from that scheme, but that figure has now increased to 142,000. The number of students in higher education has increased from 96,000 to 140,000. In terms of youth unemployment, as a proportion of teenage population, we have reduced that figure to about 6.5 per cent, which is similar to the ratio for the community as a whole.
       </para>
       <para>
        I support this legislation and our ongoing program of reform in higher education. I commend to this House and to the Australian people the wide range of initiatives we have put in place to provide education opportunities for young people.

         —Let us examine for a second the incredible logic of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Brumby). At one stage he stated that a charge of $250 was causing people not to go to university-so the Government actually increases the amount to $1,800, or the discounted rate of only $1,530. Somehow $1,530 will be easier to pay than $250. It may be difficult for somebody in this Government with its financial reputation to understand; nonetheless, I think that most average Australians will understand the nonsense of that logic. The reality is not the dishonest fabrications propounded by the honourable member for Bendigo about the fees proposed by the Liberal Party and the National Party of Australia, but, rather, the fees are $1,200 up-front, which compares with the $1,800 or the $1,530 up-front. Those fees are to be covered by Government guaranteed loans, which means that the independent people who want to take out these loans can pay them back at their own convenience when they feel it is appropriate.

         —He is just a little effervescent, Mr Deputy Speaker. Where is the Government loan to cover the $1,530? That amount seems a little difficult to find. There does not seem to be a Government loan to help those people who want to pay up-front rather than having this millstone hanging around their neck for the rest of their student days. Let me point out one minor fact which the honourable member for Bendigo conveniently managed to forget and that is that about 25 per cent of our students will receive free scholarships, which means that 85,000 students will pay nothing at all. Currently, only 19,000 students pay nothing at all and most of them are postgraduate students. This legislation does not affect the majority of undergraduate students. Our policy would provide free places to that 25 per cent on both merit and need, which is not what the honourable member for Bendigo tried to point out.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Bendigo also made some amazing statements about autonomy. I think that most honourable members would agree that institutes and individual students should have the right and freedom to choose to associate, and that they should also have freedom in many other areas. The honourable member claimed that the aim of this legislation is to protect institutes and students from State governments. The honourable member does not seem to be aware that those moves are occurring in Queensland and New South Wales. He may know that those State government moves will allow freedom of choice, but he says that the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 3), which will minimise the freedom of association, will actually allow more freedom. The logic is so convoluted that it does not bear following. In this area, as in so many other areas, particularly in the education portfolio, this Government is moving towards more centralisation, more control and more dictatorial powers for the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins). It is amazing that the honourable member for Bendigo could find words to defend it.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will now turn to the legislation in detail. This Bill arises because there has been some suggestion that the New South Wales and Queensland governments have been considering legislation to prevent universities collecting fees from other organisations. This effectively means that membership of student unions will no longer be a prerequisite for university enrolment. This Bill is the Government's response to that suggestion. The practical effect of this Bill will be to ensure the continuance of compulsory unionism in universities, or the closed shop, which clearly the left and right wings of this Government support to its extreme. However, as the Minister said in his second reading explanation, it is an attempt to intimidate the States into acquiescence. Basically, he wants to threaten the States so that they will agree to his proposals about centralisation of powers, because under this Bill any State government that attempts to stop the practice of compulsory unionism will be penalised by the Federal Government. This Bill allows the Federal Government to determine the amount of any shortfall of lost membership fees and to pay it to the union out of taxpayers' funds. It will then be claimed back from the State Government or taken from the State's revenue. These are dictatorial powers for the Minister.

         —The honourable member wants the taxpayers to support the compulsory unionism of these universities. Effectively, it means that the taxpayers will prop up the unions-in this case student unions-even when the students do not want to join and even when, in many cases, the unions do not represent the needs or desires of the majority of students. Quite clearly, the individual rights of students are being ignored, and even suppressed, by this Government.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Most students in most universities are forced to pay-`forced' is exactly the right word-up to $300 to join a union, in many cases the facilities of which they do not use and the political views of which they do not share. Student unions are important training grounds in many areas, but we should realise that in regard to this matter they are, in particular, important training grounds for future trade unionists and Australian Labor Party (ALP) activists. The statistics indicate that only 20 to 25 per cent of students actually vote in student elections. Many students are more concerned for their studies and other aspects of their university life. For years, this has meant that many student unions in Australian universities have been controlled by radical, loony, left political activists. The Bill seeks to protect the future interests of those members of the ALP at the taxpayers' expense. It is a bizarre but classic example of how the ALP sees democracy, a democracy that does not involve any freedom of choice.
       </para>
       <para>
        As has been pointed out already, student unions have been known to contribute to a number of radical causes, which they have the right to do if it is with the wishes of the majority, but the vast majority of the causes to which they contribute-without going into an exhaustive list, I will name some of them in a minute-are not representative of the interests of the majority of students. One of the main recipients of funds has been the ALP for its election campaigns. It is now public knowledge that the National Union of Students gave $50,000 to Labor's New South Wales 1988 election campaign, money that I am pleased to say went down the drain when the State of New South Wales so sensibly got rid of Barrie Unsworth's Government.

        It is also well known that the Sydney University Students Representative Council has given funds to the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union of Australia, to the Left Alliance, to protests against the Australian-American Alliance, and to a Palestine Liberation Organisation support group. I could go on; a large number of other causes have received donations from the Sydney University Students Representative Council and other councils around Australia. We will all recall that actions like this caused the downfall of the Australian Union of Students. There was a backlash at the grassroots level. In the end, the students were stirred out of their apathy to protest at the actions of a radical minority group of the students.
       </para>
       <para>
        In his second reading speech, the Minister sought to justify the Bill by stating that it is an important measure in the Government's efforts to protect the legitimate autonomy of higher education institutions. It is a crazy way to protect autonomy to impose more regulations; it is laughable. With this Bill the ALP is doing no more than ensuring that at the forthcoming election it can count on the taxpayer and the students, who may have no political direction but who are obliged to pay union fees to get into university, to underwrite the ALP campaign, regardless of the views of those students.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no doubt that the Bill is a fundamental denial of the right of freedom of association which all Australians should have to determine whether they wish to belong to a student union. The Bill continues the blatant abuse and misuse of students' funds. Compulsory unionism stifles competition while union monopoly in most cases limits choice. It means that things like university shops can charge more for an inferior service. In October this year a lockout was imposed on Sydney University's 160,000 students, which shows how unions can act contrary to the wishes of their members. The union employees barricaded eating areas, closed union run shops, shut down sporting facilities and issued union propaganda in the form of banners, posters and leaflets, all paid for out of members' funds. It was done supposedly to reprimand those in favour of the principle of voluntary unionism.
       </para>
       <para>
        The situation is, as in most other bureaucratised areas, that such control means that prices are higher. There is less competition. People cannot go off campus. They cannot go to alternative free enterprise operations. It basically means that in that protected environment the services offered are expensive and inefficient. When student unions have established a businesslike footing rather than just a left wing benevolent fund, enormous savings have been made to the benefit of all the students.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some honourable members opposite have said that they believe that unions should be treated as if they were small towns and that student unions are like local governments or local councils. The difficulty is that most governments and most councils provide the important needs of residents. We are talking here in the universities in many cases of luxuries. We are not talking about the basic requirements of being a student. Surely university sports clubs, for example, should be self-financing, as in the rest of the community. It seems amazing to me also that the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee should support the concept of compulsion. This, after all, is the body which is constantly, and rightly, complaining about the Minister's interference in freedom in academia.
       </para>
       <para>
        There was an interesting case in Victoria this year, that of Kenmar v. Monash University in front of the Equal Opportunities Board. It was essentially a dispute over the right of a student to refuse to pay the student union levy because he did not believe the union represented his rights. Because joining the union was a prerequisite of his study there, he was threatened with disenrolment. Clearly, that decision was a denial of the student's right of freedom of association. The Equal Opportunity Act in Victoria states that people cannot be discriminated against for their political beliefs. While the case went against him in the end, the Board found that the Monash Association of Students engaged in political activities and that, because these activities were different from the student's own beliefs, he was treated less favourably than other students. Although he lost the case, this point vindicates the argument for voluntary unionism.

       <para>
        In the eyes of many commentators, unfortunately, many university administrators have been forced to become bagmen for the unions. While compulsory unionism must nag at their consciences, they are forced to accept it because without union funds they would be unable to fund the services that the unions provide, unless they were accepted by the vast majority of students. Peter Costello put it this way:
       </para>
       <para>
        Although universities jealously guard their independence, their rights to free inquiry, and their rights to free speech, it seems they are all too willing to compromise their student's rights to freedom of association . . . the double standards of university administrators, who insist on, or at least acquiesce in, the conscription of students into university unions, guilds and student associations.

        It is interesting that student leaders have no qualms about the compulsory collection of levies which they spend, but are strongly opposed to government attempts to recoup some of the funds taxpayers spend on providing `free' tertiary education.

        Australia, the Government, is a signatory to those conventions. The coalition position is spelt out very clearly in our higher education policy. We do not support compulsory student unionism or, indeed, any other compulsory unionism. Apart from fundamental objections to it on a philosophical level, we also feel that the undemocratic nature of compulsory student unionism contradicts the spirit of free inquiry, association and interaction which should form the heart of all higher education institutions. The next Liberal-National Government will ensure that compulsory student unionship is not forced on students in higher education institutions which constitutionally are the full responsibility of the Commonwealth. We will also require the States as a condition of funding to ensure that compulsory student unionism is not forced on students in their higher education institutions.

        The Labor changes which have occurred over the last year or so for spurious reasons-the Government has said that the economy needs changes in the universities; the economy does need changes, although it has nothing to do with the universities but is due to the incompetence of the Government-have resulted in more centralisation, more amalgamation, more government control and intervention in direct research, towards a so-called national priority. We would support entirely the merit of freedom in research, research done for its own sake, pure research.
       </para>
       <para>
        The academic freedom of our universities is of overwhelming importance to those institutions. We would restore control to our institutions. We would encourage healthy competition. We would continue expansion. The fact that the Minister himself has been espousing a charter for academic freedom is indeed surely a de facto admission that in fact there are problems in terms of the freedoms of universities as a result of the Government's interventions and centralisation of control in the tertiary education sphere and, increasingly, also in the secondary education sphere over the last year or so. The comments by Professor Penington in regard to this matter were entirely appropriate. He basically said that the charter for academic freedom, for example, would have little meaning when the political control and the political control mechanisms are still in place, as they are under this Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        Together the Liberals and Nationals in the future will dismantle the unified system and abolish those dreaded education profiles, the means by which centralisation of control is transferred to the Federal Government. We would encourage disamalgamation. We would allow the freedom of the institutions to specialise in particular areas free from centralised control, free from the heavy hand of the Federal Government in regard to these matters. We would also make sure that we modified the guidelines for the Australian Research Council.
       </para>
       <para>
        It comes back to the same issue again and again: freedom of academia is of vital importance. Government control of the direction of research, as occurs in all the Iron Curtain countries, does not lead to an improvement in our understanding or knowledge of the world about us. It does not, indeed, even allow for an improvement in the technology of the country and its contribution to our society or to our economy, which is in such dreadful need of a boost as a result of the heavy hand of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the so-called world's greatest Treasurer (Mr Keating). The economy is in a sorry state, but, by interfering in educational profiles and in the independence of educational institutions, we are not going to improve that. Those issues are separate and relate to the reform of trade union practices, encouraging incentive and privatisation of a number of institutions to allow for freedom, competition and increased productivity. In the long run an educational program is an important part of that. The intervention of the Government, however, in these educational matters and the centralisation of control within the Minister's own portfolio and within his own office will do nothing to increase the benefits to the community as a whole. It will increase only the Minister's power.

         —The honourable member for Lowe (Dr Woods), as perhaps we should expect in this place, muttered some trite and simplistic suggestions, but the principal premise of his argument is that we should come to this place and argue consistency. He said that there was no consistency in the provisions of this legislation and that indeed it was hypocritical of the Government to take this position. I believe he was being hypocritical. The people who live in the electorate of Lowe should understand very clearly that he strongly supports the principle that, before a person has access to tertiary education in this country, he has to have $1,200 or else he cannot even get in the door. The point we in the Government have made very clearly again and again when we debate education in this place is that we believe there should be no impediment to those who wish to pursue tertiary education, if they qualify through the school system. Indeed, it is important for us to understand that there should be no impediment to their being able to pursue a tertiary study course. The Opposition's policy, announced in the Economic Action Plan, is that there will be such an impediment-$1,200. For many of the working class families who live in Lowe, that will be too much for them and will preclude them from the system.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Opposition argues for consistency in this area. I agree that some of the things said by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) are superficially attractive. He talked about individual rights and freedom of association and freedom to choose, but the choice that has to be made by students when they leave the school system is whether or not they will pursue a tertiary course. Once they choose to take that course then, just as those of us in this Government and in Australia choose to abide by the laws and rules laid down by the Government, so must those students. It is not the Federal Government that is imposing these fees; it is a State government that is trying to interfere with the right and autonomy of institutions to say that students should have a say, should be represented and have a presence in the running of their organisations and institutions.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a perfectly reasonable proposition that students should have a say. In order to do so, it is expected that there will be automatic membership of the student body. If students, once they become members of the student body, choose not to exercise their right to vote in elections for the student body and not to use the facilities and services provided, that remains their choice and they are not in any way disadvantaged by making that choice. But the choice they make to be part of the institution is one they make consciously. Once they do that they have to fall within the rules and requirements of the institutions-not of this Government or the State government but the institution. The Government is providing for the autonomy of the institution. It is the vice-chancellors of those institutions who believe that students need to have a say and should have a body to represent them and provide services and facilities. We are defending the right of the institutions to make that decision and to determine that.
       </para>
       <para>
        I understand that it is the Federal Opposition's policy that taxation in this country should be voluntary. God knows, for long enough when it was in government taxation was voluntary for many. By the same argument of consistency the Opposition put earlier, we could argue that childless couples should not have any of their tax made available for child-care, that people who do not have cars should not have any of the tax they pay made available for road maintenance, and that a working taxpayer like me should not have any of his taxation money made available for pensions. I could go on and on. If I do not have any children, why should I be paying for the education of other people's children? If the Opposition wants to argue consistency, it has to argue that, but it does not do that. Opposition speakers take a cheap point because the State Government in New South Wales is trying to make some political mileage.
       </para>

        What we are doing is protecting the autonomy of the organisations and the institutions that provide for higher education. If Opposition members want to argue consistency, they should be consistent. They should not come here and carry on as they have. What the Government is defending is the right of student bodies to be represented on campus. They are constituted democratically; they have elections; all the students have a say and have the right to vote. If some choose not to, that is their right too, just as at the next Federal election people have the right to vote informal. It is humbug for the Opposition to come here and to argue as it does on this issue. In doing so, it is not being consistent.

        The honourable member for Flinders said that what the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) is about is providing for minority, ratbag groups, left wing activists. What the honourable member for Flinders should do is go to the University of Western Australia, where I was a student some time ago, and where indeed the Minister was a student in days gone by-and an outstanding student at that, I might say. What happened at the University of Western Australia is that from time to time the student body was controlled by different groups. Sometimes it was the Labor faction or the socialist faction, sometimes it was the conservative faction. Whenever it was the left wing, or the Labor faction, whatever one wants to call it, the conservative faction was always saying that there should not be compulsory membership. It was trying to tear it down, in the same way as the Opposition comes into this place and tries to tear down Australia's economy. It does that because it suits its purposes. But what do we find now? From 1987 to 1989 the control of the guild in the University of Western Australia has been under the auspices of the Liberal group, and there has been not a whimper about this issue. It is the Liberals who are inconsistent and it is their humbug that we are seeing in this debate. When they are in control there is not a whimper about compulsory membership, but as soon as they are out of power they are all complaining.

       <para>
        The honourable member for Flinders said that student unions are not efficient. If they are not efficient, I do not support them, either. They should not be inefficient. The Government is not suggesting that they should be inefficient; it is saying that, with the dollars they raise and for the way in which they spend their money, they should be very efficient. If the honourable member is suggesting for a moment that the Government in some way is legislating for or suggesting that it supports inefficiency in those student bodies, I say to him that that is not the case. Certainly we suggest that they should be efficient. Indeed, if they are not, there needs to be management change, and within the democratic process that exists amongst those student bodies it is possible for members of the guild or union or whatever one wants to call it-it varies from place to place-to argue their case as to the way in which changes should be made, or indeed to change the leadership of the union. So it is possible within the democratic process in student unions to do that.

        The honourable member for Flinders suggested that the Australian Union of Students had for a long time pursued a very marginal agenda, that it had supported the Palestine Liberation Organisation and various other groups and that, as a result, it had fallen on tough times and that that had led to its demise. All he is doing in saying that is arguing the case that these organisations are democratic and that, if they pursue an agenda which is inappropriate for the mainstream members of the organisation, they will fall on bad times and it will bring about their own demise. Indeed, his point underpins the democracy of the way in which these organisations are constituted. He made a further grubby point, but I believe it needs to be followed up, that in fact one organisation had spent a couple of thousand dollars on producing a homosexuality pamphlet for students. I do not know what he was trying to get at. Perhaps he was trying to play on a very sensitive nerve in public opinion, but he needs to understand that 10 per cent of the population is homosexual and probably 10 per cent of students are homosexual. Therefore spending a couple of thousand dollars out of a budget of millions of dollars on that pamphlet, which provides information for 10 per cent of the student body, is a reasonable thing. The suggestion that it may not be reasonable is a dirty, grubby, underhand political point for him to make.

        The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) said in this House that the right to conscientiously object against student union membership was on the same level as the right to conscientiously object against that despicable, or certainly unconstitutional or inappropriate, conscription legislation which was introduced during the Vietnam war. I do not believe that the order of magnitude of the two things is the same. We are talking about being asked to defend one's country and to lay down one's life for a cause that one does not support, which is an issue quite different from whether or not one should conscientiously object to student union membership. If the Opposition wants to argue consistency, it should be arguing in this House against seat belt legislation. If that is the way the Opposition wants to argue, people should not be made to wear seat belts. If the Opposition believes that the order of magnitude of these two things is the same, that is the way it should be doing it. However, it does not argue that case and that needs to be understood very well.

        People must understand what being a student involves. It is something that entails a great deal of application to the task ahead. Some courses have a great many contact hours and some have many fewer, but the facilities provided on campus are very important for those students who have a great number of contact hours. For instance, when I was pursuing my course we had four lectures in the morning and a practical lesson in the afternoon. If we were lucky we had 50 minutes for lunch in the middle. We did not have the opportunity to rush down to the shop and order lunch; instead, a very good meal was provided on campus for us at a better rate than anywhere else. There was no question about that, and it is still the case. Those facilities are important.
       </para>
       <para>
        Honourable members have mentioned that it is just unfair-and I have already answered this assertion-that those services and facilities provided by the students and the student bodies are not available to everybody. I suggest that they look at a particular example, such as the University of Western Australia. The 32 different sporting clubs in that university have 2,600 members, nearly 20 per cent of the student body. That is a significant proportion of the student body who, because of their union membership, have some advantages. The Opposition might say that that is unfair, but that university has another program called the Recreate program which has between 90 and 100 courses in languages, photography, car and bike care, arts, crafts-you name it-and more than 7,000 students take part in those courses. Additionally, they have counselling facilities available. These counselling facilities are not provided by the institution, with which the students may have conflict; it is independent counselling representing students. The university has education officers and provides catering services and independent advice. It has a housing officer who provides assistance to students who need rental property close to the university. They provide a myriad of important services that students need. There is a gymnasium and health club with 1,500 members. This is not some marginalised group that is benefiting. There are 7,000 members in the Recreate program, 2,500 in sporting clubs and 1,500 involved in the health club. Indeed, the whole student body is benefiting from student union membership and the program that it puts in place.

         —It is not for me to compile the national statistics. If the shadow Treasurer has an argument with them, he has an argument with the Statistician. Today's national accounts show encouraging news. They show that the economy is making the right adjustment to a lower current account deficit. Basically they show that there was no growth in total demand in the September quarter, with import volumes falling by 0.8 per cent, while export volumes continued to grow by 2.6 per cent; hence there is a contribution there from net exports to gross domestic product over the course of the quarter. They also show that total production continued to expand moderately at 0.7 per cent for the quarter.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There are many other important influences in the accounts with which I can deal. The price deflator for private consumption rose by only 1.4 per cent to more than 6.6 per cent over the year; average weekly earnings growth was a modest one per cent in the quarter to be 7.7 per cent over the year; business investment fell 1.3 per cent in the quarter but was still up a phenomenal 20.8 per cent over the year. Combined with that are the quarterly balance of payments statistics which were released today with the national accounts. They show a welcome decline in import volumes with the decline concentrated in consumption goods but again with capital goods showing continued growth of 8.3 per cent over the quarter or a staggering 29.6 per cent over the year.
       </para>
       <para>
        The news is encouraging and shows that the economy is making the right adjustment, that is, that policy is working, demand is slowing and that slowing is reflected in the accounts for the quarter. If the shadow Treasurer wishes to have a debate with the Statistician about the discrepancy I suggest he write to the Statistician and I am sure that he will more than oblige with a reply.

         —I am very pleased to inform the House that the Government's position in front of the PBRT today is that, if the PBRT finds that a further study of pharmacy remuneration is necessary, the Government would fully support such an open inquiry. The success of such an inquiry would depend upon the full cooperation this time, as distinct from earlier times, of all parties. The PBRT has already made that abundantly clear in its statement of 17 November. The Commonwealth believes that, if an inquiry were to proceed, the terms of reference and methodology should be open to discussion in front of the PBRT.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In the meantime, the Commonwealth has put to the PBRT today that, in the course of any further inquiries, appropriate remuneration should be $4.20 for ready prepared scripts. This is the current fee operating along with the essential pharmacy allowance and the isolated pharmacy allowance. Honourable members may have read media reports today that the Government had offered the equivalent of $4.55 per script during the inquiry process. That is in fact true. After discussions with Pharmacy WA, the Government made yet another concession in the interests of providing a reasonable climate for any PBRT inquiry. We offered to raise the fee from $4.20 to $4.55 per script, including a 10 per cent mark-up from 1 January. That represents an extra $16.7m. That would have gone to pharmacy in the remainder of 1989-90.
       </para>
       <para>
        Despite the best efforts of Pharmacy WA to sell this to pharmacy leaders, particularly those of the east coast Guild branches and Community and Pharmacy Support leadership, this offer was unfortunately rejected. All that was required effectively was for such pharmacy leaders to agree to cooperate fully with the inquiry, to accept the umpire's decision whatever that may be and, in the interests of reciprocal goodwill and with respect to the PBRT processes, withdraw their campaign.
       </para>
       <para>
        This $16.7m which is coming principally from the restructuring money provided in the Government's earlier package was unfortunately rejected. It was rejected both as a sign of goodwill and as an attempt to resolve the issues, just as the same `chemikaze' leadership rejected the $60m package and the other concessions that the Government has put forward over time. The response of this leadership was to up the ante from $4.55 per script operating pre-1 November to $5.05 per script. In 1990-91, that would cost $125m over and above the Government's $60m package as well as $128m extra from the consumer by the lifting of price controls, which those opposite would do. Quite frankly, all the way through this issue we have tried to negotiate with the leadership every step of the way but for every step that the Government has taken forward the hardliners in the leadership have taken at least one step back.
       </para>
       <para>
        After yesterday's events in particular any reasonable person would have to ask the question: Does the leadership of pharmacy want the matter resolved or do some among the leadership want to create simply a lot of political heat? It is clear that some reasonable and moderate leaders really want to resolve the issues. It is also clear that a few others certainly do not. After blowing that $16.7m worth of reason, goodwill and sympathy yesterday, will they go to their members over the next couple of days and ask for more money from them for more advertisements and more action? On the one hand they try to convince people that they are serious about their remuneration and about the PBRT while, on the other hand, they knock back a $60m package. These are the sorts of questions that the membership of pharmacy in Australia today has to ask its leaders after its `chemikaze' leadership knocked back $16m yesterday.
       </para>
       <para>
        I assure the House that the Government will continue to seek out reasonable pharmacy leaders and that it will continue to stick to the proper and due processes of the Tribunal and the law. When it is all boiled down what is at stake is the issue of responsible government and the protection of Australians through the pharmaceutical benefits scheme.

The Opposition's fiscal policy would, on its own admission, increase the surplus by $400m in a gross domestic product of $366 billion-nothing-but, on the reckoning of the Department of Finance, it would actually reduce the surplus by $800m. So with a weaker fiscal policy the Opposition says it could reduce interest rates. But yesterday it admitted that it could not reduce interest rates. The Leader of the Opposition, the Opposition's finance spokesman-the Leader of the National Party in the Senate, Senator Stone-and the shadow Treasurer indicated that they could give no commitment of a reduction in interest rates under a coalition government before Christmas 1990.

        The shadow Treasurer has now asked me whether on the basis of today's quarterly national accounts, which indicate that the economy is adjusting in the right direction, that is enough to see a reduction or relaxation in monetary policy. The answer is that it is not, notwithstanding the fact that the Government has proper and mature policy settings in place and not the ramshackle policy that the Opposition has without a wages policy. On what basis does the Opposition believe that, with a weaker fiscal policy and no wages policy, it could lower interest rates? What we would have would be much higher interest rates--

         —There is legislation before the New South Wales Parliament, introduced by the New South Wales Government, to provide for enterprise agreements where 65 per cent of employees agree. Those agreements can be outside the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission and, effectively, outside the wages system. They do not require anybody else's endorsement and they override any award. There are fundamental problems with this type of enterprise approach. Firstly, the approach is out of step with the significant changes occurring in Australian industry through award restructuring. Secondly, it makes nationally consistent and accredited industry training virtually impossible because each firm will do its own thing. Thirdly, it limits mobility between jobs-opportunities for employees to move though their industry-because people will be tied to a particular organisation. Fourthly, it is based on confrontation-individuals being set against the individual employer, working out their own deal, and those with muscle being able to exploit their position to the detriment of the rest of the work force and the wage system generally. Finally, as I have said on a previous occasion, this kind of proposal is a recipe for a wages explosion. Those opposite can cry and carry on about this, but industry recognises it.

         —If they get a large wage increase inevitably that will be followed in other enterprises-only in those cases where there is muscle. In New South Wales they have this wonderful arrangement where it will be secret; no-one will know about it. Only the people working in the enterprise and a particular employer will know about it. By this marvellous mechanism the New South Wales Government somehow thinks that it will prevent a flow-on to the rest of the work force and to the rest of the economy. Industry and everybody else who is concerned with a responsible wages policy know that that is a nonsense. Effectively what it does is fragment and destabilise the wage system and industrial relations generally. That is why we saw reports in the weekend press that the Australian Chamber of Manufactures in New South Wales, the New South Wales Employers Federation and the Metal Trades Industry Association in New South Wales all told the New South Wales Government that they do not want the legislation. We can add to that the numbers in the New South Wales Parliament and the New South Wales upper House because similarly they see the legislation, as do some Independents, as a pig in a poke proposal.

        Under the New South Wales proposition and the industrial relations policy of those who sit opposite, there would be two wage systems: one operating within the Industrial Relations Commission under the national economic management policy; the other being a private operation with people doing their own thing. That can lead to only one result-a wage break-out, rampant inflation, an explosion in unemployment and, as I have said over and over again-we will keep saying it-a return to the old high unemployment days of the previous Fraser Government. The Opposition's industrial relations policy is virtually the same policy that the Fraser Government enacted and operated.

         —Let me go first to the latter part of the question. It is almost beyond comprehension that someone from the other side of the House should be raising today the question of interest rates when what is quite clearly exposed to public view is the fact that under the Opposition's proposals interest rates would stay higher for longer. Let us establish this quite clearly, because I follow up on what has just been said by the Minister for Industrial Relations. The test of what would happen to interest rates is quite simple. Even the Leader of the Opposition, with his limited knowledge of economics, would understand that there are three arms of policy which will determine outcomes-fiscal policy, wages policy and monetary policy.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Treasurer has made it quite clear that in the fiscal arm of policy the Opposition would be considerably weaker than the Government. If one comes to a conclusion on what happens to monetary policy, the linchpin, the question is: what happens to wages policy? The Minister for Industrial Relations has just gone to this issue, but I link it in with the Opposition's own wages policy. What the Minister for Industrial Relations was referring to was the New South Wales proposals. Let me make quite clear what was said by the bodies to which the Minister referred. The report is in these terms:
       </para>
       <para>
        The NSW Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Fahey, is facing intense pressure from employers and unions to amend legislation that will introduce enterprise bargaining to NSW.
       </para>
       <para>
        At meetings with Mr Fahey . . . the three peak employer groups abandoned their public facade of cautious enthusiasm and declared the Bill unworkable.
       </para>
       <para>
        Representatives of the Metal Trades Industry Association, the Australian Chamber of Manufactures and the Employers Federation of NSW told Mr Fahey on Wednesday that the Bill would cause a wages explosion.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the assessment of the employers in New South Wales, but it is their assessment of the Opposition. What did the Opposition's shadow Minister for industrial relations say in a speech earlier this month? He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Our approach is for higher real wages based on higher productivity.

         —As usual, the Opposition is never prepared to quote in full. The latter part of the question went to interest rates,. and I am pointing out what the Opposition probably does not know, that what happens to interest rates will be determined by what happens to fiscal and wages policy. I am determining, out of the mouth of the Opposition's own industrial relations shadow Minister, that there will be a wages explosion. He has said that what the Opposition is proposing is exactly the same as in New South Wales, and the employers of New South Wales have said there will be a wages explosion. So how, as a matter of logic, are we going to have anything other than higher interest rates under the policy of the Opposition when it has a looser fiscal policy and a wages explosion?
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As a matter of logic, two things then follow: we will have higher interest rates and massive unemployment. That is the logic and the inevitability of what the Opposition is saying. So the Opposition should not get up in Question Time and talk about lower interest rates under the Opposition's policy. As I and the Treasurer have said, the inevitable position under the Opposition is higher interest rates, and in fact, under the fairly remorseless analysis to which the Opposition is now being exposed, it is gradually admitting it. The Leader of the Opposition, admittedly from a less than profound economic base of knowledge, was forced to say that for three years he could not guarantee a lowering of interest rates. That is what he said; it is on the record.
       </para>
       <para>
        In regard to Mr Ferris's report, I simply make the point that, if one examines what has been happening in the economy, the structure is being put in place for an increase in exports in a range of areas, not only in our traditional areas of primary and mineral products but also in the areas of manufactured goods. We have created the conditions of a much more competitive economy, one in which there has been a much flatter movement in wages than at any other period in our history, and a tighter fiscal environment, out of which we now have investment as a higher proportion of gross domestic product than at any other time in our history. Investment is at its highest level ever at 13.5 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        That investment, which in many respects has been reflected in our imports, is creating in this country a much more competitive situation. I ask the Leader of the Opposition and those opposite: Do they attack Access Economics? That is relevant to what Mr Ferris has said. Does the Opposition say that Access Economics is an unreliable organisation? If it does, it shoots its own Economic Action Plan right down. Access Economics has said that there is $90 billion-worth of projects under construction, committed or under serious consideration. Access Economics identifies that from those projects $10 billion of export income will flow into this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        So, in regard to the issues that Mr Ferris talks about, as a result of the decisions that have already been taken by this Government the moves are in place, the projects are under way and the investment is in place to produce a significant increase in the level of exports generally and manufactured exports in particular.

The National Party of Australia is promising a $400m increase in public outlays-not mentioned or identified anywhere in the Economic Action Plan. A correction was put out by the shadow Minister. That is what he refers to now. He says that reports that the coalition will increase road taxes by 2c a litre are inaccurate. He is saying that the coalition will not increase road taxes by 2c a litre. That is what he corrected. What he did not correct was that the coalition would still spend the equivalent of 2c a litre in a further $400m outlay to local government for local roads. That is the issue. The National Party has committed the coalition to $400m of extra expenditure to local government for local roads which he says will not be funded by an increase in petrol tax.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In other words, there is a $400m commitment by the National Party, which believes it can wander around the country making promises in terms of coalition policy for which it is not accountable. The shadow Minister says he will not raise the extra money from taxes. Where will it come from? It will be paid for by cuts in government spending that we have not heard of-perhaps to schools, health or other areas of the social wage. That is so that the coalition can push $400m or a 2c a litre equivalent to local roads through local government. Perhaps the shadow Treasurer, if he has any clout left in the Opposition, will immediately move to clarify his position on this issue. Is there a further $400m of spending cuts yet to be identified? Is the petrol levy to rise by 2c a litre or is the honourable member for Gilmore simply wrong?
       </para>
       <para>
        While the shadow Treasurer is doing that he might also tell us about the two-card trick in relation to the Medicare levy which was revealed in the Sydney Morning Herald today, where it is indicated that the pay back of fiscal drag or bracket creep may be satisfied by a reduction in or the abolition of the Medicare levy. The coalition will abolish the Medicare levy and fund it with bracket creep, therefore absolving itself of that commitment. But the two-card trick is that the public will have to pay twice as much for private health cover. That is some pay back. Members of the public would get the fiscal pay back of bracket creep by paying twice as much as they pay now to a private health fund while the coalition wipes out the Medicare levy.
       </para>
       <para>
        The shadow Treasurer will have a chance to explain. He puts out half a dozen press releases a day. He can stick out another one this afternoon telling us about the status of the $400m in relation to the promise of his mate over there in relation to local roads. The shadow Treasurer should tell us about that. While he is doing so he can tell us about how he will remove the Medicare levy in satisfaction of a promise on bracket creep and what members of the public then do for medical health cover when they pay twice as much as they are paying now. If the shadow Treasurer clarifies both those issues we might have a better idea about the further weakness or stupidity of his fiscal policy.

         —An increasing number of Australians? If ever an exercise in this Parliament did not gather any legs it was yesterday's exercise. I must say that I have not been inundated with complaints from Australians about what has happened, nor am I aware that any of my colleagues have been. Let me indicate what happened in this regard. Earlier this year the Government decided to continue the Australian made campaign with an allocation of $2.4m for 1989-90. Before I go on to say what happened let me say that this decision to allocate $2.4m for the Australian made campaign-which has been, in the judgment of industry and consumers, a very successful and useful campaign-reflects the desire, I believe, of Australians to be encouraged to purchase Australian, with the slogan `Where quality is equal, buy Australian'. That responds to what Australia wants. The Opposition would abolish that funding under its Economic Action Plan. It would wipe out that campaign. That is consistent with the general approach taken by the Opposition in these matters.

       <para>
        We intended and decided to continue the Australian made campaign with that allocation of $2.4m. Seven advertising agencies, I am advised, were invited to submit proposals. Two withdrew. In July five made presentations to an evaluation committee representing the Office of Government Information and Advertising, the Advance Australia Foundation and the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. On 8 August the Government committee, which comprised Senator Walsh, Senator Richardson and Mrs Kelly, viewed four presentations. Two agencies, Luscombe and Partners and John Singleton Advertising, were preferred but they were asked to rethink parts of their presentation as the committee believed that they could be improved. The departmental evaluation committee recommended Luscombe and Partners, with Singleton rated second.

         —We are all aware that the coalition health policy has been dribbling out over the last year. In the Sydney Morning Herald this morning we got a particularly big dribble. I could almost call it a spit but I use that term metaphorically in view of the events of last week. From that particularly big dribble this morning it is clear that the coalition will try to force millions of Australians into expensive flat rate private insurance. The Government has no intention of changing the way the additional cost of Medicare is funded through a levy on taxable income. We believe that the Medicare levy arrangements ensure that payment is from each according to his or her ability to pay, providing health cover for all according to their need. As we recognise and as most economists have pointed out, this involves a redistribution from the richer sections of the population to the less well off and also from the healthy to the sick. We believe that that is the fairest system of all and one which Australians overwhelmingly support.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Sydney Morning Herald suggests that the Opposition agenda is to destroy that system and introduce regressive arrangements which will favour the better off and hurt middle and low income earners. It is very much a re-run of 1976. We do not have to make guesses; we do not have to make comments. In structure it is very much what Fraser provided in his first scheme in 1976. Do honourable members remember when in 1975 he promised, `We will maintain Medibank'? Then as soon as he got into power he introduced a system, like that which is now proposed, whereby those who did not take out private health insurance were forced to pay a higher levy-in those days, a levy of 2.5 per cent. That was the penalty rate. We are being offered exactly the same and we are being offered it under the same sleazy pretence that Medicare will be preserved. We have it on record. When the honourable member for Tangney was talking to a group of vested interests in the health field, he was asked why would he retain the name `Medicare'. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The political strategy is to recognise regrettably that the constituents whom we have to win are wider than this room and Medicare does have substantial support.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is exactly what Fraser did in 1975. Some of the better off may find flat rate insurance a cheaper option than the current arrangements but it would be at the expense of low income earners, who would pay more, through an increased levy, to make up for that shortfall. It would destroy the stability, the security and the simplicity of Medicare and replace it with a costly and confusing mess. We know it would be a mess because it is exactly the same as the scheme that Fraser introduced in 1976, and he had to introduce four more after that to try to clear up the mess. Those opposite introduced a health scheme every other year and still they could not get it right.
       </para>
       <para>
        All this is being introduced to solve a problem which does not exist. The honourable member for Tangney lives by platitudes and, in the end, he will die by platitudes. He says that the Opposition's aim is to resolve the imbalance between public and private sectors which has supposedly occurred under Medicare. More people than ever before are being treated in our public hospital system and more people than ever before are being treated in our private hospital system. Indeed, in the last year, of all the people treated in the hospital system, a bigger proportion were treated in the private hospital sector than ever before. The Opposition is therefore threatening to destroy Medicare to fix up an imbalance which has not occurred. The probable result of this is that some of the rich will pay less and the poor will certainly pay more. Is that not a familiar theme in this Opposition? It is another example of what we could call the capital gains syndrome-helping its rich mates at the expense of the poor and less well off. It is now proposing to do exactly the same in the health field.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the Opposition's plan there will be a redistribution in favour of the better off in the community. We recognise that we have done it the other way-we have taken money from the better off and given it to the poor under the Medicare scheme. We do not apologise for that. Those opposite are planning to reverse that. Finally, I remind the Opposition of just one thing-and this is very important to the Australian population whenever we have that election-and that is that by the time of the next election Medicare will have lasted a longer period than the five health schemes under Fraser.

I do not know whether he is undertaking an investigation. If he is, I am quite relaxed about it. The fact is that the aim of the Government in arranging for the RAAF to assist in maintaining domestic air services during this confrontation has been in particular to ensure that people at isolated destinations, where no alternative air travel is readily available, are not especially disadvantaged. The Government aimed to facilitate the maintenance of air services at normal fares. That required that aircraft be chartered to the airlines at a cost which approximated the normal operating costs of their aircraft. The processes of negotiation were undertaken through the appropriate Ministers and their staff. The outcome emerged from those discussions. During the course of events from August I have had discussions with Ted Harris of Australian Airlines and Sir Peter Abeles, but at no point were the details of the finalised arrangements in regard to charter costs settled by me with Sir Peter Abeles.

         —The honourable member for Bendigo shows a lot more interest in rural trade policy than does the Opposition in this place. I think that at present he is 8 : 2 over the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I have seen the comment. It appeared in last week's Australian Rural Times. There is a bit of ambivalence about the United States position. The Administration really has come out with a very gutsy position on agriculture and trade policy, and we have to compare that with what happens in Congress. For some time Mr Parker has been seeking to divert Australian attention away from United States trade and agricultural policies. That is okay; that is his job. But it is also relevant to the credibility of his comments. We need refer only to works by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to find out the truth with respect to various levels of protection for agricultural industries.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It is true that some assistance is provided to Australian agriculture. The Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) estimates that the average effective rate was about 9 per cent in 1987-88. Dairy price support accounts for about half of this assistance. That is mainly State based. The other support is through tariffs on sugar, wine, citrus, vegetables and tobacco and measures such as research and adjustment assistance. The National Farmers Federation conveniently ignores this assistance when it calls for the abolition of all protection in five years, but removing agricultural protection is very much the name of the game.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have already said that Clayton Yeutter, Secretary of Agriculture, has put on the table a very gutsy statement. This country and this House owe a great debt to the Minister for Trade Negotiations for the negotiating position he recently achieved with the Cairns Group at Chiang Mai. It is very much the main game. Once we get some GATT rules-that is our priority-we will meet them. We are sure that meeting those rules, whatever they are, will require minimal adjustment to our policies. Like everything else on micro-economic reform, this is in stark contrast to the previous Government. After the last GATT round Doug Anthony actually bragged that the Government had avoided reducing any of Australia's manufacturing industry protection. That is the measure of the Opposition's failure for Australian agriculture.
       </para>
       <para>
        I did not mind United States scrutiny of our policies, but they need to be looked at a little more closely than Mr Parker has looked at them. There is a distinction between pooling and dual pricing, and a distinction between Commonwealth and State arrangements. Some 40 per cent of that 9 per cent estimate by the IAC actually comes from the States. Of the 10 Commonwealth statutory marketing authorities only two-the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation and the Australian Dairy Corporation-hold domestic prices above export prices. We recognise that this is assistance. The IAC values this assistance at $17m and $190m to those two industries, but only two authorities, the Dried Fruits Corporation and the Australian Wheat Board, operate pooling arrangements. But pooling is not assistance; it is not a trade distorting subsidy and that is what the GATT round is all about. In relation to wheat, we now have domestic market deregulation and, like the Australian Wool Corporation, the Australian Wheat Board takes world prices. That is why I am absolutely confident that pooling would survive GATT scrutiny. No GATT rule says that the price of every commodity on world markets should be exactly the same, particularly when one is not selling an identical product. Australian standard white wheat is not hard red western wheat from the United States of America, for example. There is simply no comparsion with the massive assistance that the USA provides its farmers-assistance which goes well beyond the controversial export enhancement program.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to conclude on this note-and the honourable member for Fraser will be particularly interested in this topic: I recently chaired the Food and Agriculture Organisation conference for a week in Rome. The Director-General pointed out that $290,000m is now spent on agricultural subsidisation and protection in the world. This is to be compared with the $42,000m that is spent on aid from the developed to the developing countries. Even that $42,000m has to be contrasted with the reverse aid flow, which now pours in from the poorer countries with these massive international debts, that is now at a level of about $43,000m. That is the nature of the problem with which we are dealing and words by Mr Parker to try to distract our attention from the main game are rather ridiculous.

         —Every Australian is now acutely aware of the existence of record levels of home loan and business interest rates that have occurred for the second time in seven years under the Hawke-Keating Government. Interest rates are a very good barometer of the extent of the economic mismanagement of this Government. In moving this matter of public importance and recognising the Government's passion for living in the past and looking back over the past, I thought it important to place on the record an assessment of this Government's performance in terms of interest rates. For over seven years the Government has found it impossible to achieve a sustainable reduction in interest rates. Every time that it has tried to lower interest rates, the attempt has blown up in its face. Any reductions have been short-lived and have soon proved to be unsustainable. The one clear message that sticks out of the mess of the past seven years is that the Hawke-Keating Government has never had the policies to lower interest rates, principally because it has never had policies to lower inflation.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        On two occasions-first in late 1984 and again from early 1987 to early 1988-the Government sought to lower interest rates artificially, but in both cases it was very soon swamped by economic reality. In 1984 the reality was the collapse of our exchange rate in a series of crises during the period 1985 to 1986, which saw interest rates double. In 1987-88 the reality was our balance of payments and our debt problems. We know that interest rates are now at record levels of 17 to 18 per cent for home buyers and 21 to 25 per cent for business. We continue with the risk that there could be another Australian dollar crisis down the track.
       </para>
       <para>
        To be fair to the Government, we should go back and see whether it has misled us on this matter. The fact is that in 1983 the Government made it quite clear that it did not have an anti-inflation strategy. The best example of that was the interview that the then shadow Treasurer and now Treasurer (Mr Keating) had with John Laws on a Sydney radio program when he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        So, fighting inflation first is frankly a failure and we've gotta ditch it and we've gotta go for growth with a positive incomes policy and all I can say is that, if we are elected to office, we'll do our best to make it work. I'm not sure we can make it work, but we're going to give it a good shot.
       </para>
       <para>
        What we have seen in seven years of that good shot is unmitigated disaster from the point of view of people who are struggling to buy their homes, or those who are trying to run businesses in this country. There is no doubt that the Government went for growth in a big way in 1983-84. It was elected basically on the promise of stimulating fiscal policy, running an accommodating easy monetary policy, because it had this thing called the accord which would take care of inflation. It did not have to worry about inflation, because the accord would do the job.
       </para>
       <para>
        Honourable members might remember the Government's 1983 package, which was in sharp contrast to our package comprising 80 pages-the Government's package covered only one page and about $2.7 billion worth of initiatives, all of which were unfunded. The Government has stayed with that principle of unfunded tax relief and other changes to the Budget ever since. What happened was that by late 1984 the Treasurer was becoming very anxious that interest rates were not coming down, so he leant on the Reserve Bank of Australia on that classic occasion-the Bank Holiday massacre of August 1984-and he forced the pace on interest rates. Financial market reality struck him right between the eyes in early 1985 and again in 1986 in the form of three separate major exchange rate crises which saw our exchange rate fall by almost 40 per cent on a trade weighted basis.
       </para>
       <para>
        In response, the Treasurer then tried to tighten fiscal policy, but he did not do enough. Despite warnings from his Department and other official advisers in early 1987 that are now on the record, he went ahead and forced the pace on interest rates for the second time. He eased interest rates and monetary policy in the lead-up to the July 1987 election. He then again eased it in late 1987 and early 1988 in the lead-up to the New South Wales election. What has happened? Economic reality has again struck home. We have had 20 months of his reversing that easing of policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is important to note that the Reserve Bank now identifies 1987 as being the genesis of our current problems. It used the words `genesis of our current problem' in relation to what occurred in early 1987. In the past few days in a very good article, a couple of Reserve Bank economists have suggested that the current wage pressures and the wage explosion pressures operated under this Government and its accord could have been avoided if the pace of monetary policy easing had not been forced in early 1987. As a result, interest rates are at record levels and, in the current circumstances, financial markets are now decidedly nervous about where they are going and what the Government will do. In that regard, I will read from yesterday's Chanticleer column, which I think was very revealing in relation to the current situation. It states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The international traders with `hot money' sitting in Australia because it is the higher yielding currency can play Bob Hawke and Paul Keating for a break. They know there are probably two options left for Hawke's re-election-another wage-tax trade-off first thing in 1990; when that doesn't settle the markets, the only thing left is debauching the currency. Any attempt to engineer a drop in rates would result in no more than a blip, and possibly a devastating run on the currency which would lead in turn to even higher interest rates later as inflation leapt out of control.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Financial Review yesterday suggested a rerun of the history of 1985-86 in current circumstances where, if the Government tries to start to lower interest rates artificially without adjusting other policies, they will again be blown out of the water by a financial market which will substantially lose confidence in the Government's management and money will flood from this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        In recent days the Treasurer and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) have tried to distract attention from this economic reality with the things that they have said about their wages policy, the way the accord is supposed to be working, and so on. Even the Prime Minister recently said that he had run an internationally competitive wages policy which had given internationally competitive wage outcomes. Why, then, has the Business Council of Australia pointed out that nominal unit labour costs in Australia have averaged double that of our trading partners throughout the 6 1/2 to 7 years of this Government? Similarly the Treasurer has said, `Don't worry about it; we have this investment boom and business investment is at record levels'. The Treasurer claims that he has data to substantiate his case.
       </para>
       <para>
        We took out the figures for business equipment investment as a share of gross domestic product-such investment is, after all, the engine of business investment-and found that the current level, which the Treasurer claims to be a record level, was exceeded or equalled in 1981-82, 1980-81, 1978-79, 1970-71, 1968-69, 1967-68, 1966-67, 1965-66, 1964-65, 1963-64, 1962-63, 1960-61, 1957-58, 1955-56, 1954-55, and 1951-52. The Treasurer is outstanding in his very selective use of economic data. It is at the point now where his use of the Goebbels principle is starting to come back to haunt him. He has said it so many times that he is starting to believe it. That is the best we can get out of the Government. The fact is that in recent days the Government has eased both fiscal policy and wages policy and put even more weight on monetary policy and high interest rates by default. As we saw recently, and as the Treasurer has admitted, the Government has abandoned micro-economic reform.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the last couple of Budgets, the Government increased expenditure and delivered unfunded tax cuts; since the Budget, a host of deals have been done, but no details of how they will be funded have been given. The Treasurer today stood up in the Parliament and picked one proposal mentioned by somebody from the Opposition and asked how we would fund it. However, the $5 billion tax cuts promised by the Treasurer, the deals with Ansett and Kodak and the deal on company tax arrived at last week have not been funded. The Treasurer has not identified where the money is coming from to finance those proposals. The bottom line is that much more weight will be put on monetary policy and high interest rates.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Treasurer's so-called accord, which was supposed to control inflation, has not controlled it over the life of this Government. Indeed, the accord is not a solution to our current problems, as the Treasurer claims; it is a large part of the problem. The accord has given us nominal unit labour costs which have risen to twice those of our trading partners. Therefore, our inflation rate has been twice that of our trading partners and our interest rates are twice those of our trading partners. Until the Treasurer addresses that fundamental failing of the accord, interest rates will not go down.
       </para>
       <para>
        In political terms, the accord has elevated Bill Kelty, in particular, to Cabinet status. He can therefore dictate the shots. There will be no cuts in government expenditure any more; no waterfront reform; no privatisation; no foreign competition in coastal shipping; and no reform of the transportation and communication sectors. That is the price of the accord. In focusing on the dismal record of the Treasurer with respect to his having no policies to get inflation under control and to lower interest rates, and recognising the thousands of arguments and models the Treasurer has trotted out to distract attention from the fact that he does not have a policy solution, I was encouraged to reread parts of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. There is a very strong parallel between the Treasurer's performance in the economic debate and Alice in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Honourable members will remember the story in which Alice follows the rabbit. She falls down a hole-the Treasurer has fallen down a few holes--

She is then worried about her size, eats the cake and gets big again. She then starts to talk strangely and loses her grammar. She gets very confused. The White Rabbit comes back, but that does not really help her. Just when she is getting very confused and wondering who she is, she mutters those immortal words:

       </para>
       <para>
        When I read that, I could not help thinking about the Treasurer sitting in his office amidst a great scrapheap of failed theories. In one corner he has the J-curve; in the other he has the twin deficit theories; he also has the huge investment boom he keeps talking about. I remember the talk of investment booms earlier in the 1980s. There was talk of very large investment projects worth $46 billion and the like. What happened? Everybody started to run off at the mouth believing that we were about to go into a brave new world, a new wonderland, where we would be in the embarrassing situation of being a country, under the Gregory thesis, with so many reserves we would not know where to put them and each year we would have this problem of deciding which industries around the world we were going to buy, which countries we were going to take over-absolute, arrant nonsense! It is the same nonsense that the Treasurer has been sprouting for seven years. He has absolutely no policy to bring about a sustainable reduction in interest rates. The difference between the Government and the Opposition is that the Government cannot lower interest rates because it has no policy to do so. We have the policies that will bring about a sustainable reduction in interest rates and we will do it.

         —This matter of public importance is a sham, supported by a sham speech. The implications of this matter and the argument put forward by the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), are that the Opposition has some intention of lowering interest rates. That is the line that the Opposition is peddling in the community. Opposition members say that they have the magic solution which will create a wonderful world in which economic problems will be overcome and interest rates will be lowered. When they are actually questioned as to whether interest rates will go down, the answer is somewhat different. For instance, yesterday the shadow Treasurer was asked for a specific timetable for interest rates coming down if a coalition government were to be elected before the middle of next year. He was asked, `Could you guarantee that interest rates would come down by Christmas of next year?' he replied, `No, we don't put timetables. We never have'. So there is no indication at all that interest rates would come down by Christmas of next year.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        What about the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock)? What did he say about the timetable for interest rates coming down? His answer to that is that it would take them through the first term of government, that is, three years. So the shadow Treasurer says that it will not be before Christmas next year at least, the Leader of the Opposition says three years, and the finance spokesman in the Senate, Senator Stone, says it would be quite irresponsible for interest rates to be reduced at this time. That is the reality of the situation. The Opposition has no intention whatsoever of reducing interest rates, nor does it have the ability to do so.
       </para>
       <para>
        The matter of public importance proposed by the Opposition claims that the Government has failed to bring about a sustainable reduction in interest rates. The Government has in place the policies that will overcome Australia's economic problems. The Government has a multifaceted policy. Unlike the Opposition, whose policy, if it is examined, shows that it will rely solely on monetary policy to bring down the demand in the economy, the Government is relying on a range of policies. First of all, in the area of fiscal policy this Government has cut down government spending from a prospective deficit of some $9 billion left by Senator Stone when he was running the Treasury, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) when he was Treasurer, and the honourable member for Wentworth when he was the adviser to the Government, and has turned that around to a surplus of $9 billion. That is the largest cut in government spending this country has ever witnessed and, in terms of the public sector borrowing requirement, it has meant a shift of some 8 percentage points of gross domestic product (GDP). It has taken it from 6 per cent to minus 2 per cent. In terms of the savings, that is the largest single change that this country has ever witnessed, yet the shadow Treasurer has the gall and the nerve to come into this place and make these erroneous claims that the Government has no policies to address the fundamental problems of the Australian economy.

       <para>
        I turn to the question of wages policy. At least the Government has set in place, and has operating, an effective wages policy. It is not airy-fairy stuff; it is nothing like the Opposition's policy that is being tried in New South Wales, which has been decried by the business community; it is a policy that is in place, that has got results and that continues to get results. Under the Government's wages accord, wage levels in Australia have declined, as has been necessary, but it has been a decline which has been marked by equity. That is, all sections of the Australian community have been asked to play their part. What the Opposition is inherently saying in its wages policy is that it might be interested in the bottom line, the final outcome, as to the total wages growth in the economy but, apart from that, it does not give a damn about it. That means that the pilots could go out and grab their 30 per cent because they were in a strong industrial position. They would have the muscle to go out and get large wage increases but, of course, in the rest of the Australian economy the vast bulk of Australian workers in weak industrial positions or non-unionised positions would get completely crushed underfoot.
       </para>
       <para>
        Provided the bottom line is a reduction in wages, the Opposition would be happy. It cares not about the equity considerations of the wages policy. It completely ignores the other benefits provided by the accord-the widespread examples of occupational superannuation throughout the Australian work force and the tremendous job growth. I notice that a recent survey by the Australian National University specifically attributed some 300,000 jobs of the 1.5 million jobs created during this Government's term directly to the wages accord. Those 300,000 jobs contrast rather starkly with the quarter of a million jobs lost the last time the Opposition had a go at this free-for-all, enterprise-based wages policy. The Opposition has not changed its policies; it has exactly the same policies that it tried to employ in the early 1980s. It would achieve the same result, that is, huge increases in unemployment, huge increases in business bankruptcies, and the widespread social dislocation and despair.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is obviously maintaining a tight monetary policy. It does not get any joy from that and it does not pretend that people like it, but the Government will not artificially lower interest rates when it is known that for the long term good of this country that would be an irresponsible thing to do. The criminal act of the Opposition is that it tries to play on that hurt and gather support from the Australian community on the basis of that hurt, yet the Opposition itself has policies that would lead to higher interest rates. Even now, by its own admissions in the last couple of days, it is obvious that the Opposition has no intention of reducing interest rates either before Christmas next year or, according to the Leader of the Opposition, over some three years.
       </para>
       <para>
        What is the Opposition's real policy? What is its response? One does not really need an academic assessment of what the conservatives do in government. One can actually look at what they are doing in a couple of the States. I particularly draw the attention of the House to the State of Queensland and to what the conservative government there does in terms of its economic policies. The Opposition in this place often talks about deregulation, freeing up the various forces and letting market forces play their part. Queensland has some 1,000 quangos, that is, quasi-autonomous non-government organisations, which control every aspect of the Queensland economy and Queensland society. These boards throughout Queensland are always stacked with National Party cronies. That is an example of what the conservatives in government do about regulation. The Federal Opposition says that it wants to privatise, that it wants to sell Australian Airlines Ltd, but what does the Queensland Premier do? He wants to start his own airline. He wants to go into partnership with the Australian Federation of Air Pilots and start a new government airline. So much for this idea of privatisation. In government, of course, it is always the National Party that dictates the policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        What about other areas of structural reform? Every proposal this Government has put forward for primary industry reform has been opposed by the Queensland National Party Government. Be it sugar or deregulation of wheat transport, it has been violently opposed by the Queensland National Party Government.

         —Yes, and the dairy industry. That is the reality of the conservatives in government. None of this rhetoric about free markets, none of this rhetoric about deregulation; when they get into government, it is quite the contrary. The same factors are evident in the Federal National Party. Remember its stand on wheat deregulation? Remember what happened then? Once more the National Party flexed its muscles. Another recent example was the new Industry Commission Bill. Again, the shadow Treasurer, who had the gall to raise this sham proposal, got rolled by the National Party on a vital area of economic reform. That brought back memories of his time as an adviser to the former Treasurer, when he once said:

       <para>
        It was very frustrating. Howard would get rolled. Cabinet Ministers would sway the debate on the basis of an anecdote in the non-members bar the night before. Even if we had four feet of paper on the table, the farmers could produce anecdotes out of the air.
       </para>
       <para>
        That might have been what happened with the National Party when it was in government seven years ago, but these days things have changed slightly. It is not anecdotes pulled out of the air that determine the development of policies by the Queensland National Party; it is bank notes over the table and in brown paper bags from friends and developers that determine the policies of the National Party in government. If honourable members think that has changed because of the calling of a Queensland election and the report of the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct, I have news for them. The most recent example of the National Party deciding its economic development policy not on the basis of good, sound decision-making but on the basis of what sort of money is thrown at it is that of Seymour Developments. Seymour Developments was the company which was referred to extensively in the Fitzgerald report as having links with Russ Hinze. The principal director of that company had been placed on various trotting and racing boards in order to repay his friendship with Hinze.
       </para>
       <para>
        Recently this particular development company has funded the National Party's rather extensive advertising blitz in Queensland and-surprise, surprise-one week after the date of the Queensland election was announced, and despite all the Westminster traditions that governments should not be making major decisions once an election is announced, Seymour Developments-the company linked to the National Party through the Fitzgerald report and bank-rolling the advertising blitz-ends up getting a $131m development proposal for Shute Harbour. The same company gets the Queensland Government to buy a block in the central business district for new Public Service needs, despite all the advice that such a purchase was unwise. This same company gets a windfall profit from being sold a government site for some $4m at Admiralty Wharf in Brisbane and selling that property now, a few years later, for some $30m.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those are the sorts of development policies that the National Party stands for. They are the sorts of policies that the National Party lives by and swears by in Queensland. That is the reality of their economic development policies, and that is why the Queensland National Party disease is spreading federally. That is why in New South Wales, when the coalition government succeeds and finds itself in power down there, within a couple of months various National Party figures are brought before the Independent Commission Against Corruption. There have been all the development scandals on the northern New South Wales coast and the Tweed Shire, again involving the National Party. It is endemic amongst that particular group; it is not simply concentrated in Queensland. It is also in New South Wales and, in terms of the Nationals' influence, it is absolutely frightening to think what they could do to Australia if they ever got the chance to get back into government.

        What hypocrisy on the part of the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Blunt) who, in his latest press release, said that he wants to raise the standard of Parliament and the attitude of the public towards parliamentarians. Perhaps a fair start for him would be to disown the Don Laneses, Russ Hinzes, Brian Austins, Ivan Gibbses, Leisha Harveys and Geoff Muntzs and the other National Party Ministers who are waiting for their letters of clearance from the Special Prosecutor up there, Mr Doug Drummond. Maybe the Federal Leader of the National Party could disown them. Or maybe he could go as far as the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and suggest that the National Party has shot its bolt in Queensland and should be voted against. Perhaps that is asking a little too much, but perhaps the Federal Leader of the National Party could at least follow the lead of his predecessor in the seat of Richmond, Doug Anthony, who had the good grace to say that the major issue in the Queensland campaign was corruption. No, he does not even do that. Instead, when he comes to Queensland to campaign and give comfort and support to his corrupt colleagues in Queensland, what does he say is the major issue in the Queensland campaign?-Homosexuality! This is the screaming headline from the Federal Leader of the National Party who is trying to convince Queensland voters to stick with these squalid criminals who survive as a government in that State. That is an outrage, as is this proposal. There is no concern on the part of the Opposition about interest rates. It has no intention of reducing interest rates and has policies which will inevitably lead to rates going higher and higher.

         —This House has just had one of the fishiest diatribes from the green once-only honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) that it has ever had. He cannot answer. There has been no attempt by the Government to answer the single most important issue facing the people of Australia today: record high interest rates. The honourable member's tirade concerning practices at State government level was completely phoney because he did not make one reference to Western Australia Incorporated. If any honourable member wants to talk in this Parliament about corruption at State level he or she must talk about Western Australia Incorporated.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The real reason why the honourable member for Fisher embarked on this fishing expedition is that the Government cannot answer the matter of public importance put forward by the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson). I remind everybody what the debate is about: the failure of the Hawke-Keating Government to bring about a sustainable reduction in interest rates. What utter contempt this Government is showing for the people of Australia This is the most important issue affecting the lives of the people of Australia and the future economic well-being of the people of this country, and yet there is no answer; no answer from any Minister and no answer even from a once-only greenie.
       </para>
       <para>
        When the honourable member referred to the warnings of the shadow Treasurer about the problems of interest rates, he failed to understand that that is why the House is debating this matter of public importance-the Hawke Government's failure through its policies to allow any sustainable reduction in interest rates to occur. When we talk about government policies to bring about a sustainable reduction in interest rates, we are not just talking about future policies. More than ever we are talking about policies that have been put in place by government now for a number of years, because that is the only basis on which sustainable reductions in interest rates can occur. If sustainable reductions in interest rates are to occur, certain policies and prerequisites need to be in place.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us have a look at them. Macro-economic policy is the first and, if there is to be a reduction in interest rates, there must be more than the present reliance on tight monetary policy, which by itself indicates that high interest rates will continue. Government expenditure must be reduced if interest rates are to have a sustainable fall, and yet this Government has increased its expenditure. Inflation must be brought under control and reduced if interest rates are to have a sustainable fall and, under this Government, inflation has not been brought under control. If there is to be a sustainable fall in interest rates, Australia's trade deficit must be obliterated. Australia must trade profitably and its foreign debt must decrease and not increase at this present alarming rate. If there is to be a sustainable reduction in interest rates, there must be micro-economic reform as well in transport, privatisation and the labour market, none of which has happened.
       </para>
       <para>
        The result of the failure of this Government over almost seven years to put these policies in place is devastating for all Australians. The devastation is very well documented. Housing affordability is disappearing for the average Australian. Business investment in the traded goods sector of the type that will bring about a return to economic health for this country is not occurring. There are disincentives rather than incentives for those who want to invest in export or import-competing industries. What is worse is that it is not only the dismal record of this Government by itself over those six to seven years, which through its policies will not allow for this sustainable fall in interest rates-hence the failure of this Government-but also one can compare this Government, in the almost seven years that it has held government, with Australia's trade competitors, the other Western nations of which Australia likes to think it is a part because there are standard of living similarities, et cetera. When one looks at our standard of living now compared with when this Government gained office and at Australia's present competitiveness at the investment level where it counts compared with when this Government gained office, one will see in more stark terms the economic mismanagement of this country by the Hawke-Keating Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        To start, I will look at the current account deficit. When this Government came to power in 1983 Australia had a mild current account deficit. Now Australia has the worst deficit on record and the month just gone was the second worst ever. It is the worst deficit in real terms of any Western nation. In those six to seven years Australia's foreign debt has quadrupled. Australia now has the third highest gross foreign debt after Brazil and Mexico. Year after year we are becoming more and more dependent on imports. As the honourable member for Wentworth indicated, because of the accord our labour costs are far more out of line than they were at the time compared with those of other countries. Our productivity increase has been virtually nil.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our inflation when this Government came to power was actually slightly lower than in our competitor countries in the Western world. Now it is two to three times higher. Our interest rates were about the average of those in other Western nations. They are now the highest in real terms. What is more, the gap between the interest rates in Australia and those in other countries is widening, is hardening, rather than reducing. As an example, I point out that many business people in my area use bills as a form of borrowing. Their roll-over for 12 months is 3 1/2 to 4 per cent higher than it was 12 months ago. When this Government came to power the inflation rate in New Zealand was 30 per cent above the average for the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development; it is now back to the average. New Zealand had a massive trade deficit; it now has a credit. The interest rates in New Zealand were the highest. Now they are five to eight per cent below the rates in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        What we are saying is that it can be done and that it has been done by every other country, but it has not been done during the Hawke-Keating Labor Government's period of economic mismanagement. To add to the insult, the very high interest rate policy that this Government is fostering is actually hurting the process that is needed to put Australia right. As was pointed out even this week, it is hurting even those on the lowest interest rates, which is the housing rate of 13 1/2 per cent, because what they thought they were gaining through lower interest rates will be offset by the far greater penalty of a fall in capital value. That is all tied up with this total policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        To add a further insult from this Government and its senior economic Ministers, with the gravest problem facing us there is not a Minister in the House to take part in this debate. If the Government believed that it had an answer a Minister would be here to put it forward.

          —On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: I do not know how the practice cannot proceed when it proceeds on every occasion when the Government decides that a matter of public importance will not be brought on, that is, it moves a motion that Government Business be brought on. If, as you have ruled on this occasion, a member cannot move a motion in the middle of a matter of public importance, the motion that Ministers traditionally move to bring on Government Business could not be put. The practice is totally inconsistent with your present ruling.

If, for example, the Deputy Leader of the National Party had moved for the suspension of Standing Orders to deal with a matter that was not relevant to the matter before the House, I could understand your persisting with what you describe as the practice of the House. The difference on this occasion is that the suspension of Standing Orders is relevant to the matter that is before the House. What the Opposition is seeking to do is give the Treasurer an opportunity to speak on this matter. It is inconceivable to us that the Treasurer would escape from the House when such an important matter was being discussed.

The only qualification to that is that the matter is not relevant. This is relevant and it is a procedural motion that overrides Standing Orders, and we do say to you that you must take this course.

I believe that today you are creating, probably unwittingly, a very dangerous precedent. Your ruling is that the House does not have power to determine the flow of business, particularly when the flow of business that we are referring to is relevant to the matter that is currently being discussed by the House; in other words, there is a matter of public importance relating to interest rates. The purpose of the suspension of Standing Orders is to provide an opportunity for the Treasurer to speak in the House on interest rates. I ask you to reconsider the matter.

          —It might be helpful if I recalled for honourable members some past practices and what my obligations are as Leader of the House if, for example, I wish to suspend Standing Orders to move a guillotine motion. If there is a matter before the House it is the convention-I think it is well understood by people who have been managers of government business in the House, including the honourable member for Farrer-for the debate before the House to be adjourned. That can be done at any time. Following an adjournment by a government speaker, the normal course of events is that a motion for the suspension of Standing Orders is moved. It is not the practice that when matters are before the House we move a motion for the suspension of Standing Orders without adjourning the debate. I do not think that there is a procedure which successfully adjourns these debates. It is simply not the practice in this place for an honourable member to get up in the middle of a debate and move for the suspension of Standing Orders without the matter before the House being adjourned. We do not do it on this side of the House when we move for the suspension of Standing Orders. The practice has been well established for all honourable members opposite without their objections. I recollect a debate on that matter in this place in the last few days. The Standing Orders are well-known to the honourable member and I cannot fathom why he is not prepared to wait until the conclusion of the debate on the Opposition's matter of public importance to move his suspension motion.

         —I heard the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) say earlier that we do not want to debate the issue. The Opposition has tried not to debate the issue for the last 15 minutes. I am more than happy to debate the Opposition anywhere and at any time. The point at issue here is economic policy. Economic policy comprises three areas: fiscal, wages and monetary. Let us look at the records of all parties. Up until this week the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) have been running around in a new world promising anything and not being caught to stand up and fight. This week they were caught out and have admitted that they cannot get interest rates down. They cannot do so because their policies are a joke.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Let us look at fiscal policy. We have made the tough cuts in fiscal policy. The Opposition's fiscal policy is $800m short and that is not including the extravagant promises from the National Party of Australia, which wishes to throw a couple of hundred million dollars into roads. To do that it would have to abolish Medicare, close down schools or cut back on housing.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second arm of economic policy is wages. What a great example of economic irresponsibility on the part of those opposite it is when they talk about wages policy. For three weeks they have cried about the pilots, wanting to see a 30 per cent pay increase for one section of the community, and saying that that recipe is the way in which they will hold down inflation and have economic responsibility in this nation. What a joke. When those opposite were last in office there was a wages blow-out, massive unemployment and young people were thrown on the scrap heap. Yet those opposite still wish to embrace the same wages policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Because their fiscal policy is weaker and because their wages policy is totally irresponsible and cannot and will never work, we must turn to monetary policy. If those opposite intend to address monetary policy, and I do not think they have the intestinal fortitude to do that, interest rates would have to go through the roof-not to 25 per cent, as has been suggested, but to 30 per cent. That is the only way they could rein in any economic rationale. Let me intervene briefly and say what the Opposition's policies are all about. Over the last couple of weeks, since the election in Queensland was called, the National Party Premier in that State has promised $4 billion-worth of extra spending at the rate of $54,000 a minute. That will be added on to the very policy that the Opposition wants to introduce in this House.
       </para>
       <para>
        In case there is any doubt about the influence of the National Party, let us look at the key to Australia's future, which is exports. Exports can be enhanced only by the abolition of protection. For 40 years the McEwen monkey was on the back of farmers and industry. What has happened when we have tried to debate sugar and wheat in this House? What was the position of the National Party then? It wanted to keep us back in the 1940s. It wanted to destroy our ability to trade. It wanted to destroy the ability of the agricultural and manufacturing sectors to take off and have sustainable growth, thus creating jobs.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) outlined the things that we need to do, and we are doing them. However, he did not say that the National Party never embraced those tough decisions. The National Party has always taken the easy option. Every time it attends a farmers meeting it says, `What do you want us to do?'. When told it adopts that as its policy. Every time the National Farmers Federation meets the Nationals in Canberra the Nationals say, `What do you want us to do?'. and that then becomes their new policy. They do not have the courage to stand up and fight. Finally, this week the media cornered the Leader of the Opposition and he admitted that his policies were not the answer, that under his policies interest rates would not come down but go up in actual terms.

They are going to abolish the dole after nine months and abolish Skillshare, which is the mechanism by which long term unemployed are retrained, reskilled and go into the workplace. They have the audacity to come in here and talk about compassion. The only compassion they have is for the multimillionaires.

        Another aspect of the economy is investment. Let us look at who really votes in this nation-business, which votes with its pockets, with its money. Let us look at what happened with investment in the last 10 years before the Hawke Government came into power. Investment ran at 1.2 per cent. Investment last year was 13.5 per cent, projected at 13.9 per cent next year. I am proud to say that the majority of our imports are going to boost this economy, because it is the very mechanism by which we are going to expand our manufacturing base, which has been ignored by the other side of the House. The Opposition has tried to prevent this topic of debate and wants to run away from both the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) and me, because we are quite adequate to handle a rag-tag Opposition any time, anywhere.

The very things that the honourable member for Murray showed concern about would happen. He listed the things that were of concern.

        The modernisation of Australia's extradition laws has been an integral part of this Government's strategy in the war against crime. It is no secret that crime is increasingly taking on an international perspective. There is no starker example of the international dimensions of crime than the drug trade. Not only is there an importation of illicit drugs but also there is the associated exportation of money from Australia to pay for this filthy merchandise. Often legitimate international business channels are used to make just such payments. This Government has taken significant initiatives to combat crime within Australia. The Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 provides for a comprehensive regime of freezing and confiscation designed to attack the very motive for crime-profit. The Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988 establishes regimes for the reporting of significant cash transactions, for the reporting of suspect transactions and for the verification of identity of persons opening accounts. These measures will greatly assist law enforcement by producing criminal intelligence and creating a money trail for large amounts of cash.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having established these measures domestically, the next step is to reach agreement with other nations that will facilitate international cooperation in the fight against crime. The Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 provides just such a mechanism. Where Australia has a mutual assistance relationship with a foreign nation many of these domestic remedies may be available to that other nation. Similarly, domestic remedies regarding the freezing and confiscation of assets in that country may be able to be used by Australian law enforcement agencies. This Government has actively pursued the negotiation of mutual assistance treaties with other nations and to date has concluded nine treaties, with 15 in various stages of negotiations.
       </para>
       <para>
        Complementary to these measures is the modernisation of Australia's extradition relationships. The Government formed a task force to negotiate modern bilateral extradition treaties or extradition arrangements. So far treaties or arrangements have been negotiated with 25 countries, with 14 in various stages of negotiations. In 1988 the Parliament passed a modern Extradition Act. In light of the experience with the Act over the past 12 months or so, a need for some technical finetuning of the legislation has become apparent. The Bill before the House contains those technical amendments.
       </para>
       <para>
        I propose to deal only briefly with the more significant of these amendments. As section 11 of the Act now stands, it is not possible to list in regulations all countries to which Australia can extradite for crimes created pursuant to multilateral treaties such as the hijacking convention and the convention for the protection of internationally protected persons. It is clearly desirable that all Australians be able to ascertain easily the crimes for which extradition can be considered and all the countries to which Australia can extradite for those crimes. The amendments to section 11 are designed to enable the regulations to comprehensively list the countries to which persons may be extradited for multilateral offences. Other amendments streamline Australia's extradition relationship with New Zealand where a person consents to being surrendered to New Zealand. Finally, a new provision is inserted into the Extradition Act 1988 which will give police power to arrest, without warrant, a person who is about to abscond. A detailed explanation of all the amendments is set out in the explanatory memorandum. The amendments included in the Bill will involve no additional expenditure. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill, and commend the Bill to the House.

        That the Bill be now read a second time.
       </para>
       <para>
        A central plank in the Government's micro-economic reform agenda for restructuring the public sector is that government business enterprises (GBEs) should be as efficient as possible and responsive to consumers' needs. The GBEs within the transport and communications portfolio, in addition to producing final goods and services for consumers, also produce intermediate inputs for the rest of the economy, with a resulting impact on Australia's overall cost structures and the ability of Australian businesses to compete internationally.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government sees the commercialisation of GBEs as a necessary and fundamental pre-condition to improvements in efficiency. GBEs such as the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and the Federal Airports Corporation are therefore being placed on a more commercial footing, bringing them more into line with the disciplines traditionally associated with private sector enterprises.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Bill, together with the Federal Airports Corporation Amendment Bill 1989, represents the legislative changes necessary to finalise the Government's reform of its aviation industry enterprises. The reform package accords broadly with reform packages for other enterprises in the transport and communications portfolio which were announced in the ministerial statement of 25 May 1988, entitled `Reshaping the Transport and Communications Government Business Enterprises'.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, as a relatively recent piece of legislation, the Civil Aviation Act 1988 already incorporates a number of measures which accord closely with changes made to other public authorities through the GBE reform process. For example, the Act establishes corporate planning and financial targets as the basis for Government oversight of the CAA. To some extent, therefore, the Bill represents finetuning of the existing strategic controls over the Authority to bring them more closely into line with other reform packages agreed by the Government. It also removes a range of detailed controls which the Government still exercises over the activities of the Authority.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition to presenting the package of reforms for the CAA, the Bill also includes provisions relating to the carriage of dangerous goods, review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of decisions by the Authority to suspend a licence or certificate on safety grounds pending investigation, clarification of the provisions relating to statutory liens on aircraft and protection from state laws where the CAA performs a function directly related to the regulation of air safety. The Bill also implements two amendments arising from recommendations of the first report of the Air Safety Regulation Review Task Force.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now turn to specific provisions contained in the Bill. A key element in establishing an environment within the CAA which will encourage greater responsiveness and efficiency is the proposal to remove Public Service Act coverage of its employees, thereby making the CAA Board the direct employer and allowing a more flexible and business-like approach to the management of the Authority. Transitional arrangements contained in the Bill provide that existing staff will continue to be employed, initially, on the same terms and conditions. Mobility provisions of the Public Service Act will continue to apply.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another major change provided for in the Bill is the scrutiny of proposed statutory charges levied by the CAA under the Act by the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA). The Government believes that there is a need for visible checks and balances to be put in place to ensure that there is no perceived misuse of the CAA's monopoly position. The Minister will retain the formal power to disallow charges and be given the power to set replacement charges. The provisions are intended to enhance the effectiveness of the Minister's present power to approve or disapprove charges, by providing the Minister with the opportunity to consider any report of the PSA before making his or her decision and by enabling the Minister to set charges to replace those which are unacceptable.
       </para>
       <para>
        In line with the philosophy of moving from oversight of day-to-day operations to an emphasis on results and board accountability, the Bill removes a range of day-to-day controls exercised by Government, including controls over the terms and conditions of individual borrowings, the approval of individual contracts, the purchase of shares and the establishment of subsidiaries and partnerships. These are now appropriately the responsibility of the board.
       </para>
       <para>
        Other provisions in the Bill relating to appointment and dismissal of board members, conduct of board meetings and the appointment and powers of the Chief Executive Officer reflect more clearly the respective roles of the Minister and the board and clarify issues of administration of the Authority. Although the CAA currently pays a range of Commonwealth and State taxes and duties, it is exempt from payment of Commonwealth income tax. This Bill removes that exemption and provides for the CAA to be fully subject to Commonwealth income tax with effect from 1 July 1991.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I indicated earlier, other provisions in the Bill, unrelated to the reform measures outlined above, include measures to implement, as far as practicable, the recommendations of the Air Safety Regulations Review Task Force's first report that the cost to industry of proposed standards of aviation safety should be taken into account by the Authority, and that significant offences in the regulations relating to crucial areas of air safety should be included in the Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also strengthens the role of the Authority in specifying conditions for the carriage or consignment of dangerous goods and provides for the establishment of dangerous goods training programs for air operators and freight forwarders. The Act currently requires the Authority to grant individual permissions to carry or consign dangerous goods and to specify conditions in respect of each such permission. The section does not enable the Authority to grant general permissions. The amendments will empower the Authority to grant general permissions, in addition to the specific permissions currently provided for. Such permissions would be specified in civil aviation orders or the civil aviation regulations and would be subject to such conditions as the Authority specifies in the orders or regulations, as the case may be, in relation to the particular permission. In order to ensure the effective screening of dangerous goods the Act will be amended to provide that an air operator must not carry air cargo and a freight forwarder must not accept any air cargo unless it is accompanied by a declaration of the contents of the cargo.
       </para>
       <para>
        Provisions in the Act relating to statutory liens on aircraft have been amended to rectify a deficiency in the definition of that term, and to extend the existing protection offered to the Authority and its officers to cover actions brought for recompense of economic loss suffered as a result of seizure of aircraft under the statutory liens provisions. The Act already provides that, when an aircraft has been seized under a statutory lien, then neither the Authority nor its officers may be sued for loss of, or damage to, the aircraft.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also provides that a State law will not apply to the Authority or its property where it is necessary for the Authority to perform functions directly related to the purpose of regulating air safety. The particular functions are the provision of air route and airway facilities, air traffic control and flight services on aerodromes, rescue and firefighting services and search and rescue services. It is intended that this particular provision will only be used where the matter is essential to the performance of the Authority and negotiations with a State or local government authority have been unable to result in resolutions.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under regulation 268 of the Civil Aviation Regulations the Authority may suspend a licence or certificate if the Authority thinks there are facts or circumstances which would justify a suspension or cancellation on one of the grounds specified in regulation 269. Among the grounds specified in regulation 269 is the fact that the holder of the licence or certificate has failed in his or her duty with respect to any matter affecting the safe operation of an aircraft or that he or she has contravened a direction or instruction with respect to a matter affecting the safe navigation and operation of an aircraft.
       </para>
       <para>
        A suspension under regulation 268 ceases no later than 28 days after the suspension takes effect. The purpose of such a suspension is to allow the Authority to carry out an investigation of the matter. Unfortunately what has been occurring is that a person who has received a notice of suspension under regulation 268 has immediately sought, and invariably obtained, a stay under section 41 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act. This has defeated the objective of regulation 268 because the Authority has not been able to carry out its investigation and because the AAT in determining the stay is not restricted to considering the safety issues but may grant a stay if it considers it desirable to do so after taking into account the interests of the applicant. In some instances a decision made on safety grounds has been overturned by the AAT on economic or hardship grounds. Accordingly the Act will be amended to provide that, where the Authority has suspended a licence or certificate under regulation 268 on the safety grounds specified in regulation 269 (1) (c) or (e), then that decision will not be reviewable under the AAT Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the recommendation of the Attorney-General's Department, the Bill amends existing pecuniary penalty provisions to bring the Act into line with recent amendments to the Crimes Act 1914.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill has no immediate financial implications for the Commonwealth, although, over time, the reforms of the Civil Aviation Authority included in the Bill are expected to enhance the efficiency of the Authority and improve its returns to the Commonwealth. The imposition of income tax on the Authority for 1991-92 and subsequent financial years is expected to result in increased revenue to the Commonwealth. The amounts cannot be accurately quantified at this time, as they depend on a number of factors including the profitability of the Authority, the extent of tax deductions obtained and the prevailing tax rates. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.

        The purpose of the Occupational Superannuation (Reasonable Benefit Limits) Amendment Bill is to amend the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to implement changes to the reasonable benefit limits and related taxation measures which the Treasurer (Mr Keating) announced in his 1988 May economic statement and his Budget Speech of 15 August 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        These changes are an important part of the Government's retirement incomes policy. A basic objective of that policy is to increase significantly the role occupational superannuation plays in Australia's retirement income arrangements. For superannuation to play this role, it must be economically sustainable, attractive as a savings vehicle, and equitable.
       </para>
       <para>
        The changes to the taxation treatment of superannuation enacted in June this year put superannuation on an economically sustainable basis for the long term while retaining the concessional taxation treatment of superannuation and like benefits. The changes to the reasonable benefit arrangements proposed by this Bill bring more equity into these arrangements.
       </para>
       <para>
        The most important effect of this Bill will be the establishment, from 1 July 1990, of the reasonable benefit limit as the maximum amount of benefits a person is permitted to receive on a concessionally taxed basis. Previously, it was the maximum that could be paid out of a superannuation fund. With the very limited exemptions I shall mention shortly, the reasonable benefit limit will apply to all concessionally taxed benefits regardless of whether those benefits are provided by public or private sector sources, whether they are provided by superannuation funds, rollover funds or employers, and whether they are funded or unfunded. This important initiative redresses the long standing inequity of private sector superannuation benefits being subject to limits while public sector benefits were exempt. It also closes the loophole in the previous arrangements whereby those in private sector funds who have the ability to so arrange their affairs could receive concessionally taxed benefits in excess of the limits by rolling over before age 65 or taking additional benefits as `golden handshakes'.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has announced transitional arrangements for the application of the limits to roll-over benefits, but a number of representations have been received that those arrangements did not go far enough. The Government is currently examining whether those arrangements can be extended to alleviate any unreasonable difficulties caused by the new arrangements. The only concessionally taxed benefits which will not be subject to the limits will be bona fide redundancy, genuine invalidity and approved early retirement scheme benefits within the income tax laws.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also proposes that the method for determining the limits be set by the government of the day. This initiative was foreshadowed by the then Minister Assisting the Treasurer, the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Holding), in his second reading speech introducing the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1987. The limits and the method for determining whether a benefit is within or in excess of the limits will be prescribed in the Occupational Superannuation Standards Regulations. The regulations prescribing the limits will be made once the Bill is enacted. They will give effect to the announcements made by the Government in the May 1988 economic statement and in the Budget on 15 August 1989 on the methods of calculating and administering the limits.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Deputy Speaker, before going over the the main provisions of the Bill, I would like to mention the main features of those announcements. They represent substantial improvements for those prepared to save for their retirement. First, most members of superannuation funds will be able to save on a concessionally taxed basis enough to provide a CPI indexed life pension or annuity of up to 75 per cent of a person's highest average salary over any three previous consecutive years. A lower percentage will apply to higher income earners. The limit will be high enough to allow the pension or annuity to revert to a surviving spouse at up to 85 per cent of the amount of the primary pension and be payable for 10 years even if both beneficiaries die beforehand. The lump sum equivalent of these benefits is up to 11.25 years salary. It represents an increase of up to approximately 15 per cent in the limits for those previously saving for pensions and up to 60 per cent for those previously saving for lump sums.
       </para>
       <para>
        Second, a person will be eligible for benefits at this level if he or she takes at least half of his or her benefits as a pension or annuity which meets certain minimum standards. Where more than half of a person's benefits are taken as a lump sum, a lower limit applies, of up to seven times highest average salary. These arrangements reflect the Government's view that pensions and annuities are the preferred form of benefits, while not denying a person the choice to take his or her benefits as lump sums. Third, highest average salary will be indexed where a person takes all of his or her benefits, excluding undeducted contributions, as a pension or annuity which meets minimum standards or preserves all of those benefits to age 65.
       </para>
       <para>
        The final feature of the Government's announcements I would like to mention is that the new measures are designed to encourage longer participation in the work force and the retention of benefits to retirement. This has been achieved by removing the penalty in the previous arrangements whereby a person's reasonable benefit limit, and his or her entitlement to concessionally taxed benefits, fell if work commitments were wound down prior to reaching full retirement. Under the new arrangements, highest average salary will be indexed after age 55 when a person works a minimum amount after that age.
       </para>
       <para>
        I now turn to the arrangements proposed in the Bill for the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to administer the limits set by the Government. Providers of concessionally taxed benefits, namely, superannuation funds, approved deposit funds, employers, life insurance companies and registered organisations such as friendly societies will be required to advise the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner of prescribed details of benefits provided to individuals. Upon receipt of this information, the Commissioner will be required to determine the amount of the benefit paid to the person that is within the reasonable benefit limits and the amount of the benefit, if any, that is in excess of the limits prescribed under the regulations. The Commissioner will be required to advise the recipient of the benefit of his determination and of the basis of that determination.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill provides that amounts up to the reasonable benefit limits are to be taxed concessionally and amounts in excess of the limits are required to be paid as a lump sum, to be included in assessable income and taxed at marginal rates. Taxation of the excess amount at marginal rates together with a tax on the contributions to the fund, is intended to recoup the tax relief gained during accrual of the excess amount in a concessionally taxed environment. This measure will discourage deliberate overfunding and payment of excess benefits because the excess benefit received after tax will generally not exceed that from a non-concessional savings vehicle. This will allow the Government to remove the direct restrictions on the provision of excess benefits by superannuation funds when the relevant regulations are made. These restrictions have been the subject of complaint by the industry for a long time. It will also ensure that no-one can receive an amount of concessionally taxed benefits in excess of his or her entitlements as prescribed by the limits. This is an important initiative to ensure the superannuation tax arrangements are equitable in the long term.
       </para>
       <para>
        Providers of superannuation benefits will not be required to advise the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner of any part of the superannuation benefit which consists of undeducted contributions or concessional components, that is, bona fide redundancy, genuine invalidity or approved early retirement scheme payments; nor will providers of superannuation benefits generally be required to advise the Commissioner where they pay a death benefit to a dependant of a member of the fund. These components will not generally be counted towards the reasonable benefit limits.
       </para>
       <para>
        To assist the Commissioner to administer the limits effectively, the Bill proposes that, where a person is paid a benefit subject to the reasonable benefit limits, that person be permitted to provide his or her tax file number to the provider of the benefit for forwarding to the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner. The Commissioner requires the person's tax file number so that he can be certain that his determination of whether a benefit is within the person's reasonable benefit limit is correct, after taking into account benefits received in the past or from different sources. Where the person does not provide his or her tax file number, the Commissioner will not be obliged to make a determination.
       </para>
       <para>
        Provision of a tax file number by a person to the provider of the benefit will be on the same basis as tax file numbers are to be provided to financial institutions. There will be no compulsion to provide a tax file number but, where it is not provided, the provider of the benefit will be required to deduct tax from the benefit at the top marginal rate. Moreover, where the Commissioner does not make a determination because the tax file number is not supplied, the Bill provides that eligible termination payments, other than concessional components of those payments and undeducted contributions, are to be taxed at marginal rates.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill requires that the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner comply with the guidelines for the collection, storage and use of tax file numbers and the information privacy principles prescribed under the Privacy Act 1988. The Privacy Commissioner has been consulted on the proposals contained in the Bill on the collection, storage and use of tax file numbers by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner for the purpose of administering the reasonable benefit limits. The Privacy Commissioner has advised that the administration of the reasonable benefit limits is clearly a tax related function and that, to ensure there are no mistakes of identification, it is administratively necessary for the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to receive and hold tax file numbers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill proposes changes to the definition of a superannuation fund to enable payment of retirement benefits even where a person has not retired from full time or part time employment. This provision will enable people in part time employment to retain benefits in a superannuation fund until age 70 at the latest and persons in full time employment to do so while they are in employment but would enable the benefits to be paid at age 65 if the persons so desired. The Bill also proposes that a person be able to appeal decisions of the Commissioner on his or her reasonable benefit limit and whether a benefit received is within that limit. The person will be able to request the Commissioner to reconsider his decision within 21 days of receipt of the Commissioner's determination. Where the person is dissatisfied with the Commissioner's decision arising out of the reconsideration, he or she may appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of the Commissioner's decision.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, the Bill includes other taxation measures associated with the implementation of the new reasonable benefit limits. Those measures will ensure there is no misuse of concessionally taxed superannuation funds and will prevent funds circumventing the proposed taxation arrangements for excessive benefits.

        It is not possible to quantify the effect on revenue of the changes to the administration of the reasonable benefit limits and the other taxation measures as it will, to a large extent, depend on the options exercised by individuals. However, I would expect that the revenue impact of the reasonable benefit limits arrangements will be neutral in 1989-90 and in 1990-91. In the longer term savings could be expected in outlays on social welfare payments.

        This Bill proposes a variety of amendments to Acts dealing with defence matters. The more important amendments: amend defence force retirement and death benefits legislation to increase the orphans' benefit from $702 to $5,000; remove restrictions on the Chief of the Defence Force's power to make single service command appointments and organisational arrangements; modify provisions relating to the enlistment of soldiers and sailors to enable the open ended enlistment scheme to operate more effectively; and amend Commonwealth Acts to replace references to the Joint Intelligence Organisation with references to the Defence Intelligence Organisation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Other amendments: remove redundant provisions dealing with seniority; amend the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 to replace obsolete references to the offence of rape with references to the current Australian Capital Territory provisions that have replaced that former offence; and amend the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act (No. 1) 1985 to remove an unnecessary provision dealing with allotments. I will now deal with the more important amendments. The other changes are explained in the explanatory memorandum.

        The increases in the orphans' benefits proposed by the amendments in schedule 2 are those that I announced in my statement on 11 May 1989 in responding to the report on personnel wastage in the Australian Defence Force (ADF) by the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade-the Cross Committee. Honourable members may recall that I said then that the levels of orphans' benefits under the Defence Force retirement and death benefits (DFRDB) scheme and the Defence Forces retirement benefits (DFRB) scheme were considerably less than those under the Commonwealth superannuation schemes. The increase of some $4,300 for each orphan will correct the situation. The total benefits payable in respect of the orphans of a deceased member or pensioner will be capped at the maximum rate of pension that would have been payable to the member or pensioner. Some 131 orphans under the DFRDB scheme and 11 under the DFRB scheme will benefit immediately from the increases.

       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        Current command arrangements allow the Chief of the Defence Force to command all operations conducted by the Australian Defence Force. These arrangements have been put into place as a result of the ongoing process of refining the command of the Australian Defence Force. They are the result of implementing the recommendations of the study into ADF command arrangements conducted at the Chief of the Defence Force's direction by then Brigadier John Baker. The existing legislation obliges the Chief of the Defence Force to implement single service appointments and organisational arrangements through the service Chief of Staff. To provide the appropriate legal basis for the current arrangements, these restrictions upon the Chief of the Defence Force's command power need to be removed. The amendments make the necessary changes to the Defence Act and Naval Defence Act. The amendments in no way detract from the provision of command appointments and organisational arrangements under the Acts, as remaining provisions will contain adequate authority for these matters. There will therefore be no need to replace the provisions that have been omitted or repealed. The new command arrangements have been implemented with the support of the service Chiefs of Staff. While they no longer conduct operations, they continue to train and administer their respective arms of the Defence Force and provide advice as the professional heads of their respective service.

        Open Ended Enlistment

       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1987 the Defence Act and Naval Defence Act were amended to allow service administrators to offer enlistment to retiring age as well as enlistment for a fixed period. A soldier or sailor enlisted until retiring age may claim his or her discharge on giving an appropriate period of notice, which in relation to members of the permanent forces is 12 months or such lesser period determined by a Chief of Staff. It was the intention of service administrators at that time to offer, initially, enlistment for a fixed period followed by the option of extension until retiring age. Service administrators now consider that it is more efficient to enlist a soldier or sailor initially until retiring age but require that a minimum period of service be required before a discharge may be claimed. The amendments proposed to the Defence Act and Naval Defence Act include a provision so that a soldier or sailor of the permanent forces who has enlisted until retiring age does not have a right to claim a discharge during the first six years of service, or such lesser period as a Chief of Staff determines. Historically, six years is the minimum initial period of service required to be served.
       </para>
       <para>
        To enable effective implementation of the open ended enlistment scheme, the amendments proposed require that the approval of a Chief of Staff be required for any variation or withdrawal of a claim for discharge. This amendment is required to avoid manipulation of the procedure of claiming a discharge. Factors required to be taken into account by a Chief of Staff in determining a lesser period of service before which a discharge may be claimed and in considering approval of a variation or withdrawal of a claim for discharge are included in the proposed amendment. It will still be open to a soldier or sailor to request a discharge at any time.

        On 1 March 1989 the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) announced some changes to defence intelligence arrangements, and in particular the combining of the functions of the Joint Intelligence Organisation with those of the intelligence group in the Australian Defence Force headquarters. The Minister also announced that this restructured body will be known as the Defence Intelligence Organisation. The new name better reflects the body's central role in the preparation of defence intelligence assessments and the provision of operational intelligence for the Australian Defence Force. The amendments make consequential name changes to the various Commonwealth Acts containing references to the Joint Intelligence Organisation. These changes will enable the formal renaming of the body.

       </para>
       <para>
        The Superannuation Bill 1989 introduces a package of reforms in superannuation for Commonwealth employees. It entails the most far-reaching reforms in 67 years. It will bring Commonwealth superannuation within the mainstream of Australian superannuation schemes. It will provide benefits that will be far more attractive to members at less cost to taxpayers. The new scheme will provide: The opportunity of membership to all employees; a choice of lump sum or pension benefits; flexible contribution rates for members; substantially improved resignation benefits; and significantly tightened invalidity provisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The new scheme will be the main superannuation scheme for Commonwealth employees. The scheme will cover all Commonwealth sector employees, except those of government business enterprises, and other Commonwealth agencies, that have separate superannuation schemes for their employees. Membership will be compulsory for all permanent employees, and optional for all other staff, subject only to a three-month qualifying period. Superannuation will in future be available to around 35,000 Commonwealth employees who are unable to join the current scheme. The form for the employer benefit in the current scheme is a non-commutable pension.
       </para>
       <para>
        Consistent with the Government's policy that lump sums are a legitimate form of superannuation benefit, the new scheme will provide a choice of lump sum or pension benefits. The standard benefit on age retirement will be a lump sum. However, members will be able to convert 50 per cent or more of their retirement lump sum to an indexed pension, at very attractive rates. In effect, the new scheme provides a subsidy in order to encourage people to take a pension. This encouragement is in addition to the general tax incentives favouring pensions over lump sums. The scheme will give Commonwealth employees access to the lump sums available to private sector employees, and be consistent with the Government's retirement income policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        These reforms are based firmly on the principle that Commonwealth employees should have the same superannuation options and be subject to the same regulations and restrictions as the rest of the work force. The new scheme will comply with the occupational superannuation standards, including the reasonable benefits limits. In the current scheme, the member contribution rate is a minimum of 5 per cent of salary at all times. In the new scheme, members will be able to contribute between 2 per cent and 10 per cent of salary. This will enable members to tailor their contributions to suit their changing financial circumstances throughout their life. Benefits will be linked to member contributions, and will include the 3 per cent productivity benefit. The maximum retirement benefit for members on average salaries of between $25,000 and $37,560 a year will be a lump sum of eight times average salary, or a fully indexed pension of 80 per cent of average salary. Members on higher salaries will have maximum benefits below eight times average salary in accordance with the reasonable benefit limits. Members on lower salaries will be able to receive a lump sum of up to $200,000. This may be converted to a fully indexed pension of up to $20,000 per year.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the most significant initiatives in the new scheme is a major improvement in resignation benefits. This will correct a major inequity. More than two-thirds of members of the existing scheme receive no employer benefits because they resign before retirement. On resignation, members of the new scheme will be entitled to a refund of their own contributions with interest. They will be able either to take this in cash on resignation or to leave it in the scheme until retirement. Members who resign will also receive their 3 per cent productivity benefit accumulated with interest when they ultimately retire from the work force. In addition, a member's entitlement to the remainder of the employer-funded benefit will start to phase in after one year's membership. After four years' membership, employees will be entitled to the full employer benefit at retirement. Thus, all members will receive a Commonwealth superannuation benefit on retirement, even if they had resigned from Commonwealth employment many years beforehand.
       </para>
       <para>
        These significant improvements in superannuation benefits for Commonwealth employees will be funded primarily by tightening invalidity arrangements. While many of the persons receiving invalidity benefits in the current scheme are genuine invalids, there is evidence that invalidity retirement has been abused. A significant proportion of members have been retired on invalidity grounds by their employer against the advice of Commonwealth medical officers. Invalidity rates in the current scheme have been five to 10 times private sector rates. These invalidity rorts must stop. The current scheme provides a significant financial incentive towards invalidity retirement rather than early age retirement.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the new scheme, invalidity benefits will be more closely aligned to age retirement benefits. The assumed retirement age for calculating invalidity benefits will be reduced from 65 to 60, better reflecting existing retirement patterns. Administration of invalidity retirement will be tightened. To receive an invalidity pension, a member will have to meet the definition of invalidity in the occupational superannuation standards. That is, a pension will be paid if the member is unlikely ever to work again in any occupation for which he or she is reasonable qualified by education, training or experience. Retraining potential will also be taken into account. The trustees of the scheme will have the final say on whether invalidity benefits are to be paid. These measures will eliminate the rorts, while still protecting genuine invalids.
       </para>
       <para>
        Moreover, invalidity benefits will no longer be subject to a complex administrative process which involves determining whether the cause of invalidity is related to medical conditions existing at entry up to 20 years earlier. For those presently caught by this process, invalidity benefits will be improved, in some cases very substantially. For others, except for career employees, invalidity benefits will generally be less attractive than in the current Commonwealth superannuation schemes (CSS). In all cases, genuine invalids will be provided with an adequate pension having regard to their service to the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para>
        Current employees will be able to benefit from these reforms. Contributors to the existing scheme, except employees of government business enterprises, and other agencies, that have their own superannuation scheme, will be given an option to transfer to the new scheme over the 12 months from 1 July 1990. Others, for example people on extended leave without pay or who have a deferred benefit, will have an option to transfer to the new scheme when they rejoin a relevant area of Commonwealth employment. There will be a major information campaign to ensure all members have access to adequate information to make an informed transfer decision. Transferring members will receive a credit in the new scheme based on the standard transfer value in the existing scheme of 3.5 times their accumulated basic contributions, plus their 3 per cent productivity benefit.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will now discuss the financial aspects of the new scheme. The ending of invalidity rorts means that the improvements in the new scheme can be provided at no additional cost to taxpayers. The consulting actuaries, TPF and C and the Australian Government Actuary, have certified that, for existing employees, the cost of the new scheme will be virtually identical to the cost of the current CSS, in net present value terms, after allowance is made for tax and social security clawbacks.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has decided that the 3 per cent productivity benefit will be funded from 1 July 1990, putting this benefit for Commonwealth employees on the same footing as in the private sector. The payment of lump sums on retirement instead of pensions brings forward expenditure. If all transferees were given immediate access to employer-financed lump sums from age 55 with a full credit for past service, the impact on the 1990-91 Budget outlays would be unacceptably high. Budget outlays could increase by up to $300m. For this reason, it has been necessary to phase in access to lump sums in the new scheme.
       </para>
       <para>
        Lump sum benefits will be available only to members aged 64 and over in 1990-91. This age will be reduced progressively on each 1 July, until lump sums are available to members aged 55 and over in 1994-95. The proposed phasing-in arrangements will limit the impact of lump sums on the 1990-91 Budget to an increase of no more than $21m. In aggregate, Budget outlays are estimated to increase by $131.8m in 1990-91, $147.6m in 1991-92 and $179.2m in 1992-93. However, while net costs for existing members are the same in both schemes, there will be significant savings in respect of future employees.
       </para>
       <para>
        The cost to employers of superannuation for new entrants will fall from 13.1 per cent to 10.7 per cent of salaries, after allowing for tax and social security clawbacks and for increased coverage of casual and temporary employees. This is a saving of 18 per cent, or 2.4 per cent of salaries. Ultimately, this saving will be reflected in the Budget outlays, which will fall significantly. The new scheme entails some significant changes to the administration of Commonwealth superannuation. The legislation for the new scheme is comparatively simple. Details of the scheme are spelled out in the trust deed and rules included as a schedule to the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        A part time board of trustees, with equal numbers of employer and employee representatives and an independent chairperson, will be established to oversee the new scheme. This is consistent with the thrust of the occupational superannuation standards legislation that responsibility for fund administration and control be placed in the hands of fund trustees. The joint employer-employee trustees will have an obligation to protect members' interests. This will be reinforced with an extensive internal review mechanism.
       </para>
       <para>
        These arrangements bring Commonwealth employees into the mainstream of Australian superannuation practice, and place their superannuation arrangements on the same footing as arrangements in the private sector. However, appropriate accountability to the Parliament will be maintained. Any changes to the trust deed or rules will be by way of disallowable instruments.
       </para>
       <para>
        The new scheme is fully in accord with the Government's social justice strategy. The new scheme will substantially improve equity in Commonwealth superannuation. Membership of the scheme will be open to almost all employees, regardless of their employment status. Benefits will be related much more directly to the aggregate period of membership, whether served in one period or in broken periods. Broken periods of service will no longer adversely affect benefits. The significant indirect discrimination against women in the existing scheme will be substantially eliminated.
       </para>
       <para>
        The reform of Commonwealth superannuation has major financial implications for a very large number of Commonwealth employees. Precise individual entitlements depend on the fine detail of what is a very complex package. For this reason, I have decided to introduce this legislation at this early stage.
       </para>
       <para>
        While the basic thrust of the new scheme is in the rules forming part of the schedule to the Bill, the rules are not yet complete. For example, the treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome in the new scheme will be determined following consultation on a voluntary code of practice. The rules on partial invalidity pensions and part time temporary and casual employees have yet to be drafted. Some other details are yet to be incorporated. For example, people whose transfer credit from the existing scheme exceeds the maximum benefit under the new scheme will be paid a retirement benefit that fully reflects their transfer credit.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are also consequential amendments required to the Superannuation Act 1976 which will be introduced in the autumn sittings. This will include legislation to empower the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust to operate as a more general funds manager. The Government's policy statement Reform of Commonwealth Superannuation has been well received.
       </para>
       <para>
        The new scheme has been accepted by the Australian Council of Trade Unions and affiliates, and there has been broad support for the crackdown on invalidity abuse. At present, there is no reason to alter any aspect of the announced package. However, a period of examination over the next few months may well lead to technical improvements in the detailed implementation arrangements.
       </para>
       <para>
        By introducing the Bill for the new scheme now, honourable members and affected individuals will have the maximum opportunity to examine the detail before the legislation is considered for passage next year. During this period of examination, the Government is prepared to consider any submission on the detailed implementation of the reforms, as long as such submissions are consistent with the package as announced in the policy statement of 15 October and, most importantly, do not increase the costs of the arrangements. The Government will introduce any consequential amendments in the autumn sittings. I commend the Bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill.

        That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Fitout works at Box Hill and Moonee Ponds, Victoria, Adelaide and Perth for Australian Taxation Office.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is a proposal for fit-out works in six pre-commitment lease office buildings at Box Hill and Moonee Ponds in Melbourne, and at two locations each in Perth and Adelaide. Since 1975 the Australian Taxation Office has been decentralising its larger offices from the central business districts of major cities to suburban or country sites in an effort to bring staff closer to their work and to provide a better service to taxpayers. The Commonwealth leases the base buildings designed to accommodate the Australian Taxation Office. The special purpose fit-outs are designed to cater for the Taxation Office's computer re-equipment program. Each location will be similar and will provide some 20,000 square metres of office space. The fit-out work will be designed and constructed by Australian Construction Services (ACS) with building management input from the Australian Property Group, both divisions of my Department.

         —On 18 June 1989 the House agreed to refer this proposal to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. In the report tabled on the twenty-eighth of this month, the Committee concluded that the accommodation requirement will provide a better working environment for Australian Taxation Office staff. They will lead to improvements in efficiency and productivity and provide a better service to the public. The Australian Taxation Office has assured the Committee that it will conduct extensive discussions with staff and unions regarding the details of the fit-out. The Public Works Committee has recommended that fit-out works in six leased office buildings proceed at an estimated cost of $46.1m at July 1989 prices.

         —The Opposition does not oppose this motion. However, as Box Hill is in my electorate, I will make a few brief statements about the Australian Taxation Office to be built there. This office comprises some 22,000 square metres, which in any place would cause an enormous impact on the local community. This was one of three competing sites chosen. I believe that this one was chosen largely due to the skill of Mr Bill Heath, one of the local estate agents, who helped put the site together.

        I have followed this matter with some interest ever since the Treasurer (Mr Keating) walked into my electorate three days before the last election and promised a tax office. Some people might come into an electorate and promise a new child-care centre or some money to fix up the roads; it was interesting that the Treasurer should promise a tax office. Tax offices are about as popular as double-breasted Italian suits in my electorate. Anyway, I think it was worth about 500 votes. After the Treasurer made this promise, nothing happened; it was very quiet. In fact, tenders were only called on 10 October 1988.
       </para>
       <para>
        On making inquiries of local people, I found that when the Treasurer had made his promise plans had been quite well advanced and the Treasury had made tentative approaches to a number of local estate agents. I was a bit puzzled why there should have been a 15-month delay before tenders came out. On making further inquiries, I found that the Government was disinclined to put a new tax office in a newly-won Liberal electorate. So I am thrilled that reality has finally forced the Government to put this office in what is the largest regional centre outside the central business district, and I am very pleased to see the matter finally coming through the House.

         —I said that this has occurred over the last 30 years. On its establishment, the Defence Housing Authority took over responsibility for some 23,000 houses and has a current investment program in excess of $100m per annum. In line with our commitment to improve housing for Defence families, the Defence Housing Authority recently purchased a 32.5-hectare site at Laverton in Victoria and a 21-hectare site at Bullsbrook in Western Australia. The Authority will also acquire a 50-hectare site in Macleod, Victoria, estimated to be valued at $135m. The total price of these three properties is estimated to be in the order of $18m.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Defence Housing Authority intends to develop these sites under arrangements with private sector developers. I am sure the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Beale) will be happy about that. The benefits of such arrangements which utilise private sector expertise are twofold. Firstly, it will provide significant opportunities for local private sector companies and employment for between 200 and 270 people in each area. Secondly, it will assist in the Defence Housing Authority's mission to integrate Defence and civilian housing and provide a greater housing choice for Defence families. It is expected that ultimate development of these three sites will yield some 920 to 950 houses at a total cost of $145m. Of this total, some 400 houses will be owned by the Defence Housing Authority with 100 each at Laverton and Bullsbrook and 200 at Macleod.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Laverton site, which will yield 400 lots, is located close to existing Defence employment centres and it is planned to commence subdivisional development about mid-1990. The Macleod site, which is part of the Simpson Army Barracks, will yield up to 440 lots and is situated 18 kilometres east of Melbourne. Development plans currently include generous open space, an ornamental lake, retention of significant river red gums and a range of community facilities. The site is planned to be developed in four stages with the first stage commencing in mid-1990 and the first homes being available toward the end of 1990. The Bullsbrook site will provide alternative housing to the ex-Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement houses purchased by the Defence Housing Authority in February of this year. The land, which is adjacent to the ex-Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement houses, will yield about 185 allotments, of which 100 will be retained by the Authority for the construction of project homes. Construction of major infrastructure and the subdivision can commence early in 1990. The Authority expects that the first homes will be occupied by Defence families in the third quarter of 1990.
       </para>
       <para>
        All three projects will be subject to the relevant State planning and rezoning process. The two Victorian projects are presently zoned for Commonwealth Defence purposes and Bullsbrook is partly zoned residential and partly rural. All projects will be zoned residential within State legislation. For all projects, the due process of public comment and environmental impact under the relevant State legislation will be observed.
       </para>
       <para>
        Community needs at the Macleod development may require some shops and a child-care centre, whereas investigations currently under way on the Bullsbrook proposal suggest the development is not large enough to require additional community facilities. The need for additional community facilities at Laverton is currently being investigated. I table selected drawings of the proposed work, and commend the motion to the House.

         —The Opposition supports the referral of the proposal before the House regarding the provision of Defence housing at Laverton and Macleod in Victoria and Bullsbrook in Western Australia. Together with yesterday's proposal relating to the development of Defence housing in the Sydney area brought forward by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West), this development is sorely needed. Today's statement by the Minister paraphrases much of his statement of yesterday relating to the Defence Housing Authority proposal in the Sydney area.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Minister mentions the provision of child-care and shopping facilities at the Macleod and Laverton sites. The Minister's statement regarding the provision of such facilities reflects the Government's rather ambivalent attitude towards providing defence bases in communities with child-care and shopping facilities. Contrary to the Government's position, the Opposition's recently released defence science and personnel policy recognises that it is not only areas such as Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) base Laverton, Simpson Barracks and RAAF base Pearce which need facilities urgently but that a great many other defence establishments do also. Under Opposition policy the provision of family day care, occasional care and long-term child-care with improved access for the children of Defence Force personnel will be facilitated.
       </para>
       <para>
        Additionally, the Opposition will encourage private enterprise to establish adequate shopping facilities on or adjacent to bases where such facilities are not readily available. I add for the Minister's sake that, contrary to his pronouncements that additional facilities are not needed in the Bullsbrook area, my information is that they are in fact needed. A visit to RAAF base Pearce and the Bullsbrook area would confirm this to the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simmons). The Opposition fully supports the motion before the House.

         —The question that is before us in this legislation is that of membership of student bodies-student unions or guilds or whatever one wishes to call them. In the end, the argument that exists between the Opposition and ourselves is whether we should give priority to and whether it is desirable that there should be strong, democratic, viable student representation that should have a say in the running of our tertiary institutions.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Of course, the view put from this side of the House is that that is a priority and that it is necessary that there be automatic membership of student bodies, just as one may choose to be a member of any group or association within the community. One of the requirements is that one should pay a fee. The fee suggested by the Opposition, of up to $300, is excessive. The University of Western Australia asked for a fee of $106 and Curtin University asked for a fee of $105. For that amount of money substantial benefits are provided for students. The honourable member for Lowe (Dr Woods) said that we should argue for consistency. I made a point in relation to that earlier in the debate, and I will make it again. If one wishes to argue for consistency, equally, those in the community who are childless should say, `None of my taxation revenue should go towards child-care' and those in the community who choose not to have children should be able to say, `None of my taxation revenue should go towards providing for education'. Equally, those who are young, like me, and not in receipt of a pension, should be able to say, `None of my taxation revenue should go towards providing for pensions'.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is absurd. It is not a proposition that the Opposition accepts. If members of the Opposition come to this place and say that we should argue for consistency on this issue, they need to be consistent themselves. If one looks at the policy traditionally pursued by the Liberal component of the student body in Western Australia, which now controls the guild of undergraduates at the University of Western Australia, one does not find a whimper on this issue. When members of the Opposition are in power we do not hear anything about the undesirability of compulsory membership, but when they see fit, they take another position.
       </para>
       <para>
        Membership of a student body by those who are required to pay a fee should provide for a democratically elected body, and that is the case. It should provide an opportunity for members of the student body to change the membership should they see fit. Indeed, it does. In exactly the same way as any citizen of Australia can choose, if he or she wants, not to vote in a Federal election, so, too, can members of the student body if they choose to take that course of action. But the suggestion that there should not be adequate representation of students as to the way in which their institutions are run is something from the past. It is typical of members of the Opposition that they carp about this issue, which, if one looks at the history of the Fraser Government, is not an issue that was pursued in seven years when they controlled this place and the other place.
       </para>
       <para>
        Why has this issue been raised in the House today? It is because there is an opportunity to score some political points in New South Wales. The honourable member for Lowe suggests that Queensland is also taking this action. After the weekend the issue will not be a problem in Queensland; so we will have one State government which wishes to challenge the autonomy of the institutions. The institutions agree with this. They will impose and collect the fee. The decision is not made by the Federal Government. The suggestion that we are interfering is not accurate or true. People need to understand that the institutions agree with this. The vice-chancellors have said that they think it appropriate.
       </para>
       <para>
        This provides the opportunity for the student bodies to have democratic representation; it provides the students with counselling services and with an opportunity to have a say in the running of their institution. If the students disagree with some things, they have representation on all of the senate committees which run the university, college of advanced education, or whatever it might be. That our opponents should see something sinister in this is an issue which we have some difficulty with. We are about providing for fundamental and reasonable autonomy for institutions. We are about providing for student bodies that can have a say in the running of their institutions. We do not think these student bodies should be in some way emaciated. We see these student bodies as requiring assistance and requiring the membership to be wholehearted. I have a great deal of support for the legislation and I hope that Opposition members will take the view that it is important that students should be represented in the running of their institutions.

       <para>
        I was amazed to hear the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) say that this Government is about giving universities autonomy. It is about nothing of the sort. Action after action of the Hawke Government in the tertiary education area has been about forcing institutions to do things that they would prefer not to do. He referred to the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee. The Vice-Chancellors Committee has made plenty of critical comments about this Government's policy in relation to tertiary education and coercion. The reason the Government would bring coercion to bear in relation to membership of student unions is that it knows very well that if students could vote with their feet they would not join these student unions while their money was being spent on some of the activities in which some of the unions have indulged in the past. No-one doubts that there is a need for certain facilities at tertiary institutions but it has been a matter of great controversy and conflict that money given to a student union-and presumably for facilities for the students-has gone to political activities in relation to the Palestine Liberation Organisation, for example, and other quite disgraceful activities in university terms. A lot of universities and vice-chancellors have been gutless on the issue-and I do not mind saying it.

        I want to draw particular attention to a situation in the Gold Coast College of Advanced Education, which is in my electorate. It is due to graduate its first students this year. It was established three years ago and is growing extremely rapidly. It anticipates that in a very short time it will have reached a very large enrolment figure, which is not surprising. One of the great difficulties of being a member of parliament representing the Gold Coast area is persuading governments that figures do not lie. Part of the Gold Coast lies in my electorate of Moncrieff; the rest lies in the electorate of McPherson. Over the years predictions have been made about growth on the Gold Coast, all of which have come true. The current prediction is that by the turn of the century the present population of the Gold Coast will have grown from a quarter of a million to half a million. There has been an urgent need for tertiary education facilities on the Gold Coast for some time. I firmly believe that the only thing that pushed this Government into making the decision to go ahead with the Gold Coast CAE was that the setting up of the Bond University was announced. It was subsequent to the announcement of Australia's first private university to be established on the Gold Coast that the Government finally was pushed to make a decision to establish the Gold Coast College of Advanced Education.
       </para>
       <para>
        The college's growth is very much under threat at the moment, and I want to refer to that. Despite its rapid growth and previously approved programs, both in development of courses and in capital programs that go with them, thanks to this Government the college has lost its 1989 capital funding and its 1990 capital funding is in doubt. I have drawn attention to this on two previous occasions this year in speeches in the House on 16 June and 26 October.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to put on the record what has actually been transpiring between the Commonwealth Government and the State Government on this issue. I will quote principally from relevant correspondence and then indicate what all this means in relation to the Gold Coast College of Advanced Education. In June the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) tabled a higher education funding document which showed that funding for the Gold Coast College of Advanced Education was to be reviewed. At the time I objected to this on the grounds that a decision had been made that the college would enter into an amalgamation with either Griffith University or the University of Queensland-that decision had been conveyed to the Minister-the delay in the funding having been justified by the fact that previously there was some doubt as to whether it would enter the unified national system of tertiary education.

       <para>
        On 24 July this year, the Queensland Minister for Education, Youth and Sport, Hon. Brian Littleproud, wrote to the Federal Minister for Education requesting that funding for stage 2 of the teaching building of the Gold Coast College of Advanced Education be released. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        I am writing at this time to seek your agreement to release these two buildings to enable an early start on their construction. Further delays will make the provision of accommodation for students in 1990 extremely difficult.
       </para>
       <para>
        The GCCAE is currently engaged in serious discussions with the Brisbane universities with the view to establishing a relationship which will enable it to become a member of the Unified National System. While this process will possibly take a further extended period of time there is no doubt that such a relationship is inevitable.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under these circumstances I would appreciate your early approval to the release of the funding for these two buildings, one of which includes a significant contribution from the Queensland Government to enable the commencement of basic nurse education from the beginning of 1990.

It is the Council's expectation that an intent to affiliate with one of these institutions acceptable to both governing bodies, the Queensland Government and the Commonwealth Government, will be reached no later than 17 September 1989. I would add that the major impediment to finalisation of this process is the matter of financial support from the Commonwealth Government to consolidating institutions. Quite rightly the institutions believe that there is an expectation for appropriate support for such activities adumbrated in the White Paper.

        On 21 August the Acting Chairman of the Gold Coast College of Advanced Education wrote further to Minister Dawkins advising him:
       </para>
       <para>
        At its meeting on Wednesday 16 August the Council of the Gold Coast College of Advanced Education resolved that it would advise the Council of Griffith University that it wishes to enter a stage of detailed and exclusive negotiations with Griffith University in respect of the Gold Coast College of Advanced Education becoming an affiliated University College of Griffith University. In addition it resolved that the Joint Working Party already established by the two Councils should proceed expeditiously to finalise a Memorandum of Agreement between Griffith University and the Gold Coast College of Advanced Education.
       </para>
       <para>
        He indicated to the Minister that he had conveyed the content of the resolution to the Chancellor of Griffith University, to the University of Queensland and to the State Minister for Education. He continued:
       </para>
       <para>
        In view of the Council's resolution and the fact that a Joint Working Party has been established by the Councils of Griffith University and the Gold Coast College of Advanced Education I wish to seek your approval for the release of Capital Funds for Stage 2 of the Gold Coast CAE Building Program.
       </para>
       <para>
        ... ... ...
       </para>
       <para>
        In communicating this information I wish to advise that the Council of the Gold Coast CAE enters these exclusive and detailed negotiations with a very positive affirmation of its desire to consummate a productive and mutually beneficial University College relationship with Griffith University.
       </para>
       <para>
        On 22 August, Minister Littleproud wrote to Minister Dawkins referring to his letter of 24 July and seeking urgent release of funds for teaching buildings. In the letter he stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        I understand that the Joint Working Party already established by the two Councils is now proceeding to finalise a Memorandum of Agreement between Griffith University and the Gold Coast College of Advanced Education.

       <para>
        ... ... ...
       </para>
       <para>
        In the light of the above determinations I write to ask again for the expected funds associated with the Gold Coast College of Advanced Education building program to be released so that the building program which has been `frozen' can now proceed. If the necessary accommodation for student intakes planned for 1990 is to be completed it is quite critical that these funds should be released as soon as possible.
       </para>
       <para>
        Accordingly, I request your urgent action in this matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        On 23 August, one B. C. Milligan, First Assistant Secretary of the Higher Education Division of the Department of Employment, Education and Training, Central Office, wrote to the Chairman of the Gold Coast College of Advanced Education referring to the Chairman's letter to the Minister of 26 July about the funds. He stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        I am replying on the Minister's behalf.
       </para>
       <para>
        In part the letter states:
       </para>
       <para>
        I am encouraged to learn that the College is engaged in discussions with Brisbane universities and that a firm arrangement is not far off. The Department is not, however in a position to release further funds to the project until arrangements for the College to become part of the unified national system are formalised in Heads of Agreement documentation.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was the first time the condition that formal heads of agreement had to be actually signed before funds would be released had been conveyed to any of the parties in this amalgamation. On 29 August Minister Dawkins wrote to Minister Littleproud referring to Minister Littleproud's letter of 24 July about funding. In part he stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        I am encouraged to learn that the College is engaged in discussions with Brisbane universities and gain the impression from your letter that a firm arrangement is not far off. I would therefore prefer to wait until a formal agreement is made, between the College and one of the universities, before releasing the capital funds.
       </para>
       <para>
        On 30 August the Vice-Chancellor of Griffith University wrote to Minister Dawkins to say that he was confirming discussions with the Gold Coast college and that there was a positive affirmation on its part:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . to achieve a productive and mutually beneficial University College relationship with Griffith University. The University, for its part, having proposed such discussions in December, 1988, welcomes the negotiations and is pursuing them as speedily as possible.
       </para>
       <para>
        There could therefore have been no doubt about the bona fides of all parties in the negotiations. On 13 October, Minister Dawkins wrote to Minister Littleproud referring to Minister Littleproud's letter of 22 August and saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        By now you will have received my letter of 29 August 1989 which advised that I will wait until the College enters into a formal agreement before releasing the capital funds. That is still my position.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was the Minister's position, stated several times as from Mr Milligan's letter of 23 August. Following that letter I put a question on notice in which I asked in part:
       </para>
       <para>
        Has it been a consistent requirement of his-
       </para>
       <para>
        that is, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training-
       </para>
       <para>
        that amalgamations of tertiary institutions must proceed to the stage of a Memorandum of Agreement between two institutions before Commonwealth funds for approved capital building programs are released; if not, in which cases have capital building funds been withheld from institutions which have given an undertaking to amalgamate but which have not yet signed a Memorandum of Agreement.
       </para>
       <para>
        That question remains unanswered. It does not seem to be a very difficult question. As far as I know, no other tertiary institution has had that condition put on it. On 25= October I made a speech to the House on this subject. Subsequent to my speech a letter from Senator Mal Colston appeared in the Gold Coast Bulletin, which in part said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The CAE is currently discussing amalgamation or merger proposals with Griffith University. The Federal Government cannot however make funds available merely on an undertaking that negotiations are being held with another post-secondary institution. That is no guarantee that an amalgamation or merger would in fact proceed. If an agreement is formally reached with Griffith or any other similar institution, the funding for the CAE's second stage will be made available without question.
       </para>
       <para>
        The ball is very much in the CAE's court.
       </para>
       <para>
        I repeat:
       </para>
       <para>
        If an agreement is formally reached with Griffith or any other similar institution, the funding for the CAE's second stage will be made available without question.
       </para>
       <para>
        The ball is therefore very much in the CAE's court.
       </para>
       <para>
        On 8 November, Minister Littleproud wrote to Minister Dawkins and stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        I have now sighted a signed copy of the Memorandum of Agreement between Griffith University and and the Gold Coast College of Advanced Education.
       </para>
       <para>
        A copy is attached for your information. I now write to formally request that the funds for growth and capital works at the Gold Coast College should be released.
       </para>
       <para>
        On 8 November-the same day-the Vice-Chancellor of Griffith University also wrote to Minister Dawkins. He, by the way, faxed his letter to Minister Dawkins on the same day. The letter states:
       </para>
       <para>
        I am pleased to advise that a Memorandum of Agreement between the University and the Gold Coast College of Advanced Education was entered into by the governing bodies of the institutions on 8 November, 1989. A copy is attached.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Director of the Gold Coast College of Advanced Education wrote to Minister Dawkins on 9 November saying:
       </para>
       <para>
        I am pleased to advise that following endorsement by both Councils a Memorandum of Agreement has now been signed whereby the Gold Coast College of Advanced Education will become a University College of Griffith University. A copy of this Memorandum of Agreement is attached.
       </para>
       <para>
        ... ... ...
       </para>
       <para>
        In view of the fact that the Memorandum of Agreement has now been signed I seek the Minister's approval in releasing Commonwealth Government funds for Stage 2 of the College's Capital Building Program. It is crucial that construction of the buildings in Stage 2 commence as soon as possible in order that the continuing demand for higher education in the Gold Coast region, the State and the Nation can be met.
       </para>
       <para>
        To date none of these letters from Minister Littleproud, from the Vice-Chancellor of Griffith University or from the Director of the Gold Coast College of Advanced Education has been responded to by Minister Dawkins.
       </para>
       <para>
        Last week, on Tuesday, 21 November, I contacted Minister Dawkins's office and indicated to him that I would like an appointment to discuss the subject of the funding of capital works for the Gold Coast College of Advanced Education. We arranged that I would have an appointment with him at 3 o'clock on Monday, 27 November. On Monday a message came to my office indicating that the Minister could not keep that appointment and offering that I meet with some of his staff. I said `No' and that I wanted to discuss the subject with him personally, otherwise I would give my views on the subject during this debate. He then wrote a letter dated 27 November, which I received the next day, the twenty-eighth, in which he stated in part:
       </para>
       <para>
        I have however taken the view that, in cases such as the Gold Coast, where one or more of the parties to a merger are not members of the UNS, capital funds will not be released until all parties have agreed to the terms of a memorandum of agreement and it is clear that any necessary legislation will be passed by the relevant State Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have therefore asked the Queensland Government if it supports the proposed arrangement and for an assurance that it will legislate for the merger. On receipt of that assurance, I will arrange for immediate release of funding for the college's building program.
       </para>
       <para>
        What absolute rot! In those letters that I have quoted from Minister Dawkins and his officers, time and again they have said that the only condition was a signed memorandum of agreement. I have queried Minister Dawkins whether that condition was put on any other tertiary institution, but that query remains unanswered. Nevertheless, the institutions have now given the Minister a signed memorandum of agreement. Now he says `and'-another condition is added, a condition which has not been adverted to at any stage previously. Nothing could be clearer than the fact that the Queensland Government supports that merger for the purpose of obtaining the funds.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator Colston issued a press release on 28 November. Apparently he received the same letter as I did from the Minister. The press release states:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . today he [Senator Colston] had been informed by the Federal Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, that all that is now required for the capital funding to be released for the Gold Coast CAE is Queensland Government support.
       </para>
       <para>
        If anything has not been beyond doubt throughout this matter, it is the support of the Queensland Government. The same honourable senator, who a few months earlier wrote letters to the Gold Coast newspapers saying all that was required was the memorandum of agreement and that it was up to the CAE, now alleges that the Queensland Government is holding up the matter. It is nothing of the sort. The press release continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        I am confident that a Goss led Labor government will provide that assurance without delay.
       </para>
       <para>
        Despite the fact that the Minister said in the letter to me that he has asked the Queensland Government whether it supports the proposed arrangement, he has not responded to Minister Littleproud. No communication has been sent in response to Mr Littleproud's letter of 8 November. I checked with Minister Littleproud's office this afternoon and his staff checked all sections in case a letter had been sent but had been sidetracked to another office. They went through all their files, but there is no response to the letter of 8 November that went to Mr Dawkins from the Queensland Minister requesting the funding.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is just a cheap, shabby ploy which, one presumes, has something to do with the Queensland election which is to be held this Saturday. In the meantime, the building of the Gold Coast CAE is being delayed, and that is serious. If the approval had been given three weeks ago when the Queensland Minister requested it of Minister Dawkins, the tenders for those buildings could have been close to finalisation. Tender documents have long since been drawn up. Tenders could have been advertised and they could have now been received. Apparently, we now have to wait until after the State election before this Federal Government will commit itself to funding the building of the Gold Coast CAE, by which time we will be in the pre-Christmas period. The delays that will have been caused because of the Commonwealth Government's shuffling of feet and trying to strike a political pose-this miserable contribution by Minister Dawkins to the Queensland State election-will be very serious indeed. This capital building program should have been under way this year; it should have been finished next year. Students are waiting to enrol at this college.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Queensland Government has committed millions of dollars for nurse education and it is waiting on this Commonwealth money for those courses to go ahead. There is no doubt at all about the bona fides of the Queensland Government in relation to proceeding with the Gold Coast CAE. The Queensland Government has made it very clear that it was not happy about forced amalgamations, but it has legislated for all the amalgamations for which the final stage of agreement had been reached. It might say that it did not do so willingly and that it is not what it would have chosen to do; but it has acknowledged the fact that such a course has been forced on it by the Federal Government and that it has bowed to pressure placed on it by the Federal Government. It has never given any inkling that it would do anything else in relation to this college.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a disgrace that Minister Dawkins should try to hide behind press releases from Senator Colston. It has been left to me to send a copy of the letter I received from Minister Dawkins to Mr Littleproud, otherwise he would not even know that this additional condition had been placed on the funding. He has not received any communication to that effect from the Federal Government. I look forward to discovering whether, for once, the Minister in this place will state where he stands in relation to the Gold Coast College of Advanced Education, quite unequivocally, and regardless of the outcome of next Saturday's election in Queensland. Will this money be provided for the building of the Gold Coast CAE?

         —The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 3) is about autonomy for higher education institutions. In short, the Bill is about reducing State government interference in that autonomy. It is about leaving the decisions of institutions, the running of institutions and the decisions that should be made to the institutions themselves rather than having one level of government impose its will and direction upon individual institutions. It is quite right that, if we are to respect autonomy amongst higher education institutions, then we should leave those democratic choices on such matters as the content of courses, assessment of students' progress, the research that is undertaken in these institutions, staff appointments, and so on, to the institutions themselves. I might also include vice-chancellors in those staff appointments. It is still the case in Queensland that two or three vice-chancellors at higher education institutions are not appointed by the institution itself but, rather, they are appointed by a decision of the Queensland Government. I do not suggest that anything improper has taken place in relation to those appointments, but at least they transgress the principle of autonomy for higher education institutions.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        One of the most important freedoms for academics, both students and staff, is the freedom of expression on campus and beyond campus on matters related to education and attendant upon education. This Bill refers to freedom of expression, the right of opinion, and the ability for student bodies to arrange their own affairs. What student bodies can do on campus, whether or not they can impose fees, and how they can spend those fees within certain limits, is determined by the governing council of an institution. So, if an institution decides within its own processes that there should be what have become known as compulsory union fees so that a range of student services can be provided, that decision is made not by government but, rather, by the government of the institution, and it is wrong and improper for governments to interfere with the decision as to whether or not compulsory union fees should be levied.
       </para>
       <para>
        During this debate there has been a certain amount of sophistry. The Opposition has attempted to oppose the right for there to be compulsory unionism amongst students, but I note that the contributions have been very short. Honourable members opposite have, as did the honourable member of Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), immediately gone to the topic of education institutions within their own electorates. I have no criticism about that, because it is right and proper for members of this Parliament to express through this House, to the Minister, their concerns about higher education in their own electorate. I will do the same thing later on.
       </para>
       <para>
        I return to a matter central to this Bill. By opposing this Bill, the Opposition is in fact supporting the heavy hand of government. It is indicating that it is right for the New South Wales Government to interfere with the autonomy of a higher education institution and to say that there shall not be compulsory union fees. It is signalling very strongly that should a Federal Liberal government ever occupy the government benches it would introduce global national legislation to bring about the same effect. The Opposition is signalling that it opposes that form of academic freedom-freedom of the institution to determine a collection through compulsory union fees.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition has tried to bring in this rather bogus analogy between unionism amongst the trade, craft and guild unions and the student unions. We know that a union is a collection of people, a bringing together of people with a common intent and agenda. That is what is meant by a union, and that is what the students want. It is why students continue to support, almost universally, compulsory student unionism. They know that if they stick together they have the strength to get across their message in their campaign for better deals for education from all governments. They also know that a range of education services, such as counselling and sporting facilities, would not be available from the income of institutions; they are available only because that income is supplemented by student union fees.
       </para>
       <para>
        When the Opposition talks about academic freedom it talks about it in a very sophistic way. By advocating interference in academic freedom, the Opposition actually puts up an argument for trampling on academic freedom. If Opposition members believe in academic freedom, why do they not believe in the Latin motto, res non verba? Why do deeds not follow their words? We are not talking about compulsory membership of a trade union; we are talking about a different form of union. An analogy can be drawn between those who would like to opt out of paying compulsory fees, which is what the Opposition is arguing for, and those who would like to opt out of paying taxes. Student bodies are elected. They make decisions after an election process. The election is democratic, and if students do not like the result that is their problem. But the result is democratic. Therefore, the decisions of a student body have a legitimate basis for what they do with those student union fees. There are plenty of people in our community who would like to opt out of paying tax. Given the choice, the average person would not pay any tax at all but would still expect a full range of government-provided services. With the elimination of the capital gains tax, we will return to a situation in which the payment of tax will be voluntary for certain wealthy, asset-rich members of society.
       </para>
       <para>
        I return to the campuses of higher education institutions. If people can choose to opt out of paying compulsory union dues which provide a range of services, we will be in a similar position to that obtaining when people put up the argument that they did not want their taxes to contribute to the Vietnam War. In this Parliament we have heard others say that they do not want their taxes to contribute to Medicare rebates associated with the termination of pregnancy. We cannot opt out of individual spending programs if we are to have a government with a legitimate Budget and a range of programs. Once an institution has declared that it will collect compulsory student union levels, the question of whether students should be able to opt out is raised. We are not talking about those students who have a legitimate conscientious objection. We are talking about the general principle. The exercising of a freedom does not come without responsibility. If one exercises an option not to participate, one also has to consider why a choice to opt out exists. I do not think people have a right or licence to ignore involvement.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Lowe (Dr Woods) presented three basic arguments, which were carried by others in the Opposition, as to why there should not be compulsory union fees. One argument was that only 20 to 25 per cent of the student body vote. Let us compare this figure to other election figures. In Australia, we have compulsory elections. Many countries overseas do not have compulsory elections. The turnout at such an important and significant election as the national election in the United Kingdom is only something like 50 to 60 per cent of voters. Even if there is only a 20 to 25 per cent turnout for student elections, that is no argument against compulsory union fees. It is an argument for activists to involve others. It is an argument for those who complain about the decisions made by the 20 to 25 per cent of voters, therefore the activists, to become more involved. It is certainly irrelevant to whether there should be a compulsory fee.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second argument put forward by the honourable member for Lowe was that there are students who do not agree with the political opinions expressed by student union bodies. It seems to me that anyone who does not agree with the Government, the student representatives, those who have successfully voted through the ballot box on the campus have the right-in fact, the obligation-to carry their complaints into action, to become involved and to work to change the composition of the political majority on that body. In other words, they have an obligation to become involved and to exercise their right to free expression, which is what this Bill is trying to maintain.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Lowe in his third argument said that many students are more concerned with their studies than with involvement in student politic. He said that in a disparaging manner. That may well be true for many, but others go beyond their studies when they assess education and make a contribution to it. They do not see the situation from a `Me only, I must succeed' point of view. They see education in broader terms. They see the right of access to education going beyond those within the campuses of higher education institutions to those who have missed out. They are the ones who are campaigning to the Government and to the Opposition, through student bodies, for a better deal for students and for higher education itself. A government of the day might not like it, but that does not mean that its embarrassment and discomfort will support the argument for reducing the income to institutions via higher education compulsory union fees. Not one complaint has been sent to my electorate office about compulsory union fees. Therefore, I suggest that there is no mandate for the Opposition to oppose this Bill. In fact, it has a mandate to support it. It is trying to hijack the debate by misrepresenting it with some loose analogy with unionism generally. It is trying to stifle any political input into the education debate.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Moncrieff said that she found that many undesirable campaigns-they were her words-took place; yet, as I have said, the way to change campaigns is to change the composition of the union body by becoming involved. But let us look at the campaigns. This Government had to put up with campaigns against its program of introducing the higher education admission charge. We did not squeal about that; we did not cut off their funds and say, `This is undesirable'. We met head on and debated their point of view. Again, when we replaced the higher educations admission charge with the higher education contribution scheme there was a body of opinion on campuses that once again opposed this Government. But we did not go out and cut off funds to student bodies. We believe in the right of criticism and we believe in the right of academic freedom, so we let it go. We won that argument through debate, which is as it should be done.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, the Opposition knows that it will come up against the full front of a campaign by the student bodies against its proposal to introduce a $1,200 up-front before enrolment charge before people can enter higher education institutions. In other words, under a possible future Liberal government every student who goes to a higher education institution must produce $1,200 before enrolment. That is not to be compared with the Government's program of students not paying until they receive the benefits of higher education. So, really, the hidden agenda of Opposition members is to silence the student bodies and their criticism of the Opposition's $1,200 up-front charge for higher education before the next election. The Opposition is clearly divided in its opinion on the value and the right of academic freedom, and the right of institutions to run their own affairs. I support the Bill.

         —I would like to make a brief contribution to this debate on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill for a very strong personal reason, and that is that in the time that I have been in this House, and particularly during the time that I was Leader of the Opposition, I have developed a very close association-and I am very proud to talk about it-with the various Liberal student bodies on the campuses throughout Australia. As the current patron of the Australian Liberal Students Federation, I am more than happy to speak very strongly against this quite outrageous proposal by the Hawke Government. If ever there was a convoluted exercise of logic chopping, it is what we have just heard from the honourable member for Streeton (Mr Lamb). To suggest that the attitude that we take on this measure is an assault on academic freedom is to engage in quintessential logic chopping. What the Government is proposing to do with this measure, through the use of the money power of the Federal Constitution, is coerce the States and tertiary institutions into toeing the line on its own anti-freedom of association ideological commitment.

       <para>
        This Bill is an assault on the principle of freedom of association. What is at risk is not the right of the citizen to selectively decline to pay taxation and to bear the cost of the general services of government. That is sheer sophistry, and the honourable member for Streeton knows it. What is at stake here is the simple principle of freedom of association. Are we or are we not in favour of freedom of association in this country? That is why, over a very long period of time, the Liberal clubs on the campuses of universities and other tertiary institutions throughout Australia fought what was at times a very torrid battle against compulsory unionism and to win the hearts and minds of students on campuses.

         —Yes, they have taken it to court. I believe they have won the respect of a growing number of people who resent the allocation of their funds to partisan political purposes. The honourable member for Streeton himself will know that, on occasions, the National Union of Students has given money to support particular candidates taking a partisan point of view. That, of course, destroys the total analogy with the desire of citizens to opt out of paying taxation because they object to particular things to which the taxation is allocated, because it is allocated irrespective of political belief. Schools are available to people whether they vote Labor or Liberal. It has nothing to do with a person's political affiliation; it has everything to do with providing the general services of government.

        I turn to this tortured argument about the provision of facilities. If a university wants to provide certain facilities, let it increase its administration charge; let it not go through the phoney device of raising revenue by compelling people to belong to a student body, the policies espoused by which they may despise. We had a positively heart-rending contribution from the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth), who talked about the cold meat pies and the poor facilities provided when he was at university. That provokes recollection of our own experiences. When I attended the University of Sydney law school in the late 1950s it was then, as it now is, physically separate from the main body of the university. The meagre amenities provided then were a very poor recompense for the compulsory fees that were extracted from us, as they have continued to be extracted from generations of students who have attended the University of Sydney. So that kind of argument cuts no ice.
       </para>
       <para>
        I simply want to put on record in this debate my own very strong personal commitment to the principle of freedom of association for student union bodies. I greatly admire the campaign that has been run by the Liberal clubs and associations throughout Australia over many years, and as patron of the Australian Liberal Students Federation I am very proud of the role that those bodies have played in breaking down and exposing the hypocrisy that lies behind this particular approach. I think it is a very sorry day when this Government proposes to use the money power of the Federal Constitution-that is what it is doing-to coerce State governments and universities into maintaining an insidious form of compulsory unionism. That is what the Government is doing, pure and simple.
       </para>
       <para>
        I can only say to the Government that the battle on this will go on, because the resentment to compulsory association and the rejection of compulsory unionism throughout the campuses around Australia are very strong and very deep. I totally endorse all of the remarks made by my colleague the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), who has put the Opposition's case in his normally eloquent fashion and who understands a principle when he sees it-unlike the members of the Australian Labor Party who have participated in this debate who, when it comes to associations, put on their old blinkers. I think the Czechs and the East Germans have left Government members behind. On issues like this, Government members run the risk of being a stranded, endangered species. They are still arguing for a collectivist approach, when all of their mates have left them miles behind. When it comes to these things, they will be the last bastion of 1968. Rhetoric aside-I suppose one is allowed the occasional piece of rhetoric in these matters-what we ought to do is recognise this for what it really is. It is a squalid exercise in compelling people to belong to something against their will. That not only violates my liberal instincts, but also violates the sense of fair play and fair association of the majority of Australians, and that is why we are opposed to it.

        —On behalf of the Commonwealth of Australia branch delegation, I present its report on the Thirty-fourth Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference. The Conference held special significance for Australia, being held in our bicentennial year and in our new and permanent Parliament House. I was pleased to have the honour to lead the delegation.

      <para>
       Delegations from 104 parliaments and legislatures attended the Conference, along with 106 observers from international organisations and Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA) member branches. There was a total of 520 participants, including spouses and unofficial observers. Visitors came from every part of the world: Asia, from Singapore to India; the Caribbean; Europe and the Mediterranean; Africa; North America; and the Australasian-Pacific area. As well as diverse geographic locations, the delegations came from the broad spectrum of parliamentary systems, including republics, monarchies under Queen Elizabeth II and national monarchies. Sir Ninian Stephen, the then Governor-General, drew on the theme of the geographic diversity of the countries attending the Conference in his opening address. He told delegates that their presence was abundant testimony to the enduring vitality of parliamentary institutions throughout the Commonwealth of Nations. He encouraged those present to draw hope from the gathering and the agenda that it had set itself, that the evils of the world could be eradicated.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Conference deliberations consisted of four plenary sessions and six panel sessions. The first plenary session, that on international peace and security, was presented by His Excellency Shridath Ramphal, who presented an historical perspective on the world's troublespots, before addressing the theme of the plenary session. He commented on the need for circumspection in talking of peace, especially in regard to the approximately 20 million people who have died as a result of armed conflicts in the postwar era, mainly in developing countries. He called on the Commonwealth to be a standard-bearer for peace and on each parliament to reaffirm the Goa declaration.
      </para>
      <para>
       Among the key topics covered in the other sessions were drugs and what the Commonwealth can do to curb drug abuse and drug-trafficking, the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, the current General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade discussions, the negative effects of the declining world economy on women and young people, and the establishment of a parliamentary branch of Amnesty International. The Commonwealth of Australia branch delegation participated fully in the plenary and panel sessions. As members of the delegation of one of the host branches, we felt we had a special reponsibility, as well as the usual obligation to participate fully. We felt an additional obligation to our guests to assist and encourage them in their participation. As well as the main proceedings, there were other activities associated with the Conference. The Eighth Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference of Members from Small Countries and the meetings of the Society of Clerks-at-the- Table are of particular note.

      <para>
       The Conference, in all its facets, was an outstanding success. The delegation wishes to record its appreciation of the efforts of the State branches and their executive committees and staff, Senator Sibraa, President of the Senate, the Conference Coordinating Committee headed by Mr Browning, and Mr Kieran Schneeman, and the staff of the Parliamentary Relations Office. I also thank Mr Mark McRae, the secretary to the delegation, for his efforts prior to, and during, the Conference. I would also like to thank all of those other workers behind the scenes who worked arduously throughout the whole Conference and late into the night and early hours of the morning. Their efforts should also be recorded here tonight because the work that is done behind the scenes by those people is never really appreciated by delegates and other people who attend conferences. I was honoured to have the opportunity to lead the branch delegation, and I wish to thank the deputy leader, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), and my fellow delegates, both Commonwealth and State, for their support and cooperation.

        —Limited in numbers, not in quality, I wish to put some very heartfelt remarks on the record about this Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) was absolutely right in the tribute that he paid to participants in that Conference. I will begin by reading into Hansard the names of the members of the Australian delegation. It was led by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the other members were the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), Senator Coates, Senator Harradine, the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), Senator Macklin, Senator Reid, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), Senator Teague, myself, and Mr Mark McRae as secretary. Being a member of that delegation made me damn proud to be an Australian and honoured and privileged to be a member of parliament. It was a truly inspirational conference. To be able to see people from all over the world in every conceivable form of costume and dress coming together and striking such common accord on so many issues of concern to them, their constituents and the world was, as I have indicated, a truly inspirational experience.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Like the Minister I, too, would like to pay tribute to all those people behind the scenes. Again the Minister is absolutely right: we in this Parliament do not realise that the staff of the Parliament are deeply committed, not just to the institution of the Parliament, but to the work that they carry out. I believe-as I am sure the Minister does-that the work undertaken in the course of this Conference was above and beyond the call of mere duty and not undertaken for monetary reward. I pay tribute to all those people.
      </para>
      <para>
       There were various matters discussed at the Conference, as the Minister has indicated. One issue of particular interest to me was an initiative that we as Australians took to place on the agenda of that Conference the idea of establishing a parliamentary branch of Amnesty International. I had the opportunity to chair that session and, for me, it was a very difficult exercise, because I found that people from different countries, not having the same perception of human rights as Australians have, at first considered that the agenda item had been introduced with the intention of launching some attack on their countries. That was not the case and that forum continued to focus on the policy question and the need for establishing parliamentary groups of Amnesty International. By any account, it was an extremely important session.
      </para>
      <para>
       We, as Australians, ought not to be sanctimonious or self-righteous about our attitude to human rights. Having said that, we have great reason to be proud of our record. Australia is the only country in the world to have a parliamentary amnesty group that comprises well over half the members of the Parliament and has as its patrons the leaders of all the major parties in the Parliament, including the Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister. Most importantly of all, this group has managed to seek the bipartisan support of both the Government and Opposition to ensure that Australian foreign affairs representatives take up the concerns of Amnesty International in a very active way. Indeed, two-thirds of the cases taken up involving prisoners of conscience were taken up as a direct result of initiatives of the parliamentary group.
      </para>
      <para>
       My main point is this: that is a model for action by government that Australia should export to the world. The Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference was a very significant venue that allowed us to tell other parliamentarians of that achievement. I commend all those who participated in that exercise, including the honourable member for Dundas. I am aware of the time constraints. Again, I pay tribute to all those who participated and to the leadership of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs.

It was a unique experience because it allowed delegates from various Commonwealth countries to visit this Parliament House-the Parliament House of a country that is unique in this region. It is a practising parliamentary democracy, with parliamentary and democratic freedoms that we take for granted in this country.

       I had the privilege of being the first Australian speaker at the plenary session on international peace and security, with special reference to Southern Africa, Namibia and South Africa. Indeed, I took great pleasure in delivering that speech. The issue I was addressing-the attempt to get a workable peace conference to settle the Namibian dispute-was very important to a number of delegates attending that conference. The expressions by African delegates on the remarks I made received wide support, particularly from the United Kingdom. I am pleased that, shortly afterwards, the peace settlement in Namibia was reached.

       Australia was able to show off this Parliament House to the other Commonwealth countries. From my wide discussions with the delegates who attended the Conference, I can record that they went away with an impression of Australia as one of the great lands on this earth. It was almost unanimous. People from all over the globe went away with the firm conviction that this is indeed the lucky country. I would also like to join with other members in expressing my appreciation for the support of the staff who assisted so ably in ensuring that the Conference went very successfully. I also thank the staff, including the catering staff and the attendants in the House, who did so much to show Australian parliamentary democracy at its best.

         —This evening in this adjournment debate I want to raise a couple of matters that are concerning a few of my constituents. It is ironic that, appearing at the bottom of the letterhead of the Australian Taxation Office, appear the words:
        </para>

       <para>
        TAXES-Building a better Australia
       </para>
       <para>
        I refer to a quite difficult situation that is arising with strata title units. I imagine that this problem affects people all over Australia but it certainly affects constituents in Joslin and Farrant streets, Prospect in the electorate of Adelaide. A letter appeared in today's Advertiser from Mrs Clarke of South Brighton. She is the secretary of one of these small groups of home units. The problem the owners are faced with is a retrospective issue which goes back over three years. They are being forced by the relevant legislation to pay back taxes on accrued interest. I know that the legislation provides that income tax must be paid on income earned on investment, less all expenses and costs. But in these strata title units former residents may have died, sold out or moved on for various reasons and they will have to be tracked down so that they can pay their share. The retrospective tax rates are 49 per cent for 1986-87, 49 per cent for 1987-88 and 39 per cent for 1988-89. The Commissioner of Taxation will apply a penalty if the return is lodged later than the date set, which is February 1990. In her letter Mrs Clarke said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Would it not be fairer to have a non-taxable allowance of, say, $50 per unit per annum on income derived from investment in banks, building societies, etc?
       </para>
       <para>
        Unit holders commit money to a fund which is held by the secretary of the strata title units for repairs and maintenance. In some cases, such as the Freemasons, the masonic lodge home that was brought to my attention, only a small amount of money-as low as $170-is in the fund. The cost of having a taxation agent service the account may be more than is in the account. Using the figures I gave before, the amounts involved would be $85 for the first two returns and $61 for the third return.
       </para>
       <para>
        I bring this matter to the attention of the House. It is a matter of growing concern to people who have taken the opportunity to go into these units and put aside money for maintenance such as plumbing and painting, or perhaps adding a veranda. That money earns interest and the interest is subject to income tax. As I said, some owners have moved on and the strata title secretaries have to find them and get money from them. The Australian Taxation Office uses the words, `Taxes-building a better Australia', but it is in fact attacking some of our older residents.

         —Tonight I wish to speak with reference to the enormous profits that are being posted by some of our major banks and, in particular, the National Australia Bank (NAB), which recently posted a profit of $782.7m after tax. I guess it would not be unreasonable to suggest that this profit expressed in before tax terms would be well in excess of $1 billion. Since 1985, the National Bank's profit has increased from a figure of $302.108m after tax to the present figure of $782.7m after tax, an increase in excess of well over 100 per cent. One of the contributing factors to the bank's exorbitant and massive profits lies in the fact that its interest rate margins are the highest of any bank in the Western world, according to my information. I understand that overseas banks operate within a range of 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent while the National Bank, I am reliably informed, operates within the 4 to 5 per cent range. The records will demonstrate that the National is always the first to increase its base lending interest rates while it is the last to drop its rates in a declining market.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It may not be commonly known that banks are in a far better profiteering position when interest rates are on the decline, as is happening now, with 180-day bank bill rates steadily declining for the past month. I would caution National Bank borrowers in coming months to be on the lookout to ensure that they are deriving the benefit from any publicly announced base interest rate reductions. I understand that when a similar situation occurred in January-February 1987, the National offset the publicly announced reduction in the bank's base rate by increasing the interest rate margins of borrowers by a similar amount. Borrowers, of course, were not informed of this action, which was nothing short of a rip-off. I am reliably informed that, at this time, the initial instruction from the National Bank's State manager to regional managers was by telephone communication. I understand that one regional manager, in onforwarding this directive to his branch managers by way of memorandum, was so incensed by the move that he refused to sign the memorandum.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am reliably informed by a constituent, one Mr John Salmon, of Mansfield, Brisbane, a retired National Australia Bank Ltd employee with just over 36 years banking experience, 16 years at managerial level, that the NAB is also guilty of other highly unethical activities. Mr Salmon retired on 31 December 1986 and, since November 1987, has been engaged by a number of solicitors to act as a bank consultant in cases involving litigation against his former employer. I consider Mr Salmon to be highly intelligent, well-meaning and honest and I have no hesitation in accepting his assurances as to the truth of his allegations.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Salmon tells me that, during his experience with the National Australia Bank, pressure from some regional managers has forced some branch managers to introduce interest rate borrowing margins as high as 10.5 per cent, which resulted in borrowers being charged the exorbitant interest rate of 29.25 per cent.

         —It is usury. Needless to say the customer is unaware of the rate being charged. On 28 July 1989, Mr Salmon wrote to the Commissioner for Corporate Affairs in Brisbane setting out details of what he considered amounted to banking malpractice. In his letter, Mr Salmon makes a number of allegations involving his former employer. He alleges that in two cases which have been before the courts he has determined as follows:

        A number of other allegations are made in the letter and I understand that Mr Salmon's allegations are presently the subject of an inquiry by the Australian Federal Police. I understand that this police inquiry relates to a complaint made by the directors of a company arising out of a Federal Court case which has now been finalised. Time limits my going into further detail on these very important matters. I can assure the House that I intend to pursue the allegations by Mr Salmon as contained in his letter of 28 July.

        Recently the Government, in consultation with the Australian Bankers Association, has set up a seven-member independent council, under the chairmanship of Sir Ninian Stephen, known as the Ombudsman Council.

        I strongly caution members of the public to be very careful in their dealings with the National Australia Bank. If they have any doubts whatsoever that they are being charged incorrectly they should immediately contact their branch manager. Indeed, if they are careful they can save hundreds, perhaps thousands, of dollars by insisting on knowing what interest rate they are being charged. I urge consumers not to be afraid to contact their bank and to double check that they are being charged correctly. If not, they should shop around and get the best deal available. It is about time that Mr Nobby Clark, the National Australia Bank's Managing Director, stopped criticising the Government for the sake of gaining publicity for himself and instead started to look into cleaning up his own back yard and investigating these very serious claims against his own bank.

         —An historic meeting was held today at the Brisbane City Hall. It was a meeting called by the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, the Hon. Sallyanne Atkinson, as a result of the tremendous pressure that has been put on the Lord Mayor to try to call together a discussion group of the parties to the present pilots dispute to see whether there was some neutral ground that could be established for discussions to take place. If honourable members had just watched the news on television they would have seen the Brisbane City Hall was packed for that meeting. Present were representatives, admittedly, of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, the tourist industry, small operators, the Australian Hotel Association, the Queensland Tourist Industry Association and travel agents. The list goes on.

The invitations to Federal members of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) were obviously ignored as well because there was no apology and nobody turned up. More interesting than that is the fact that the State Labor Party members who were also invited did not bother to go either. Yet this was a meeting that was to be held on neutral ground in a bipartisan manner to try to work out what was happening to the Queensland tourist industry. With an election coming up this weekend, it is most significant that the Leader of the Labor Party in Queensland-the State manager of Hawke-Keating Inc.-Mr Wayne Goss, completely ignored the meeting.

The point about this is that throughout the Queensland election campaign the Labor Party has not mentioned the pilots dispute once. It has run for cover up and down the coast of Queensland whenever it has been challenged about the effects of the dispute. I trust that members of the voting public in Queensland, especially in tourist areas, will begin to show their wrath when they go to the polls on Saturday.

         —That is one of the most classic lines. We all realise that, although the Prime Minister says that there is no dispute, if the honourable member's staff tried to get an aeroplane from Canberra to their own State tomorrow night they would not be able to do so. When we ask whether we will be able to get out of here on Friday by commercial aircraft the answer we are given is no, because the aeroplanes are not there. There is no dispute, but something is happening because people cannot get airline seats.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The real point of the whole exercise is that, throughout the Queensland election campaign, the devastating effects of the airline dispute have been ignored by the State Branch of the Australian Labor Party. It could not care less about the fact that about 2,200 people have been put out of work in a place such as Cairns. Does the Labor Party think that the State electorate of Cairns will return a Labor member this Saturday? Of course it will not do so. If the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Gayler) looks at the market research, he will see that he is gone too. The honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) is in big trouble, as is Bundaberg. The Labor Party's part in this dispute and its failure to resolve it will be sheeted home to it. This has been the worst industrial dispute in Australia's history. It has resulted in the loss of 22,000 jobs around Australia and is costing our greatest industry so much. On Saturday the voters of Queensland will put their wrath firmly where it belongs and that is against the State members of parliament. They will vote Liberal for a good tourism policy that will help to resurrect what was once our proudest industry which has been shot to pieces through the sheer neglect, incompetence and blithering stupidity of the Federal Labor Government and its cohorts in the State ALP.

         —I wish to speak on the matter of identification by the media of witnesses to violent crimes. Last month in my electorate a shooting took place near premises known to police to be a centre for criminal activity. The victim had suffered five gunshot wounds and was assisted by one of my constituents who had been nearby when the incident occurred and had clearly seen the two men leaving the scene.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In the chaos that soon followed, with the arrival of police, ambulance personel, media and numerous spectators, my constituent was questioned by a number of people about what had taken place. He became aware that one of the questioners was a reporter and that his replies were being filmed and recorded on videotape. The man had at no time identified himself as a reporter nor asked for permission to record an interview. At this point, my constituent stopped speaking and moved away, realising the implications of speaking publicly. He was approached several times by the reporter from Channel 9, but declined to speak further and left the scene after giving statements to the police. The shooting at this time was considered by police to be related to criminal activity, possibly a gangland or underworld incident.
       </para>
       <para>
        Channel 9 ran the interview on its 6 o'clock news bulletin that night, with the name of the witness screened in bold letters while he spoke, instantly placing him and his family in potential danger and subjecting them to fear and uncertainty. My constituent immediately contacted the police to ask who had made his name available to the media, since he knew he had given no details. It appears that the reporter had requested and obtained the witness's name from the police.
       </para>
       <para>
        The actions of Channel 9 and the police raise very serious issues in relation to the treatment of witnesses to crime. Firstly, the failure of the Channel 9 reporter to identify himself, a procedure which is laid down in the code of ethics of the Australian Journalists Association, point 8 of which states:
       </para>
       <para>
        They shall identify themselves and their employers before obtaining any interview for publication or broadcast.
       </para>
       <para>
        The reporter involved quite clearly breached this code of ethics, but I believe the decision of the news department in publishing the witness's name, without first checking whether consent had been obtained, constituted a thoughtless and irresponsible act which could easily have had disastrous consequences. As it was, the family lived in fear for some days, believing their lives could be at risk.
       </para>
       <para>
        This raises the question of self-regulation by the media. One would expect that, in such circumstances firm operational procedures would be in place which would ensure that no interview would be broadcast or identification of witnesses made without the prior permission of the person involved. Such people are often shocked and confused, in situations totally unfamiliar to them, and cannot be expected to be aware of cameras and reporters, let alone the implications of speaking about what they have witnessed. Speaking into the camera and providing details of one's name is taken by media organisations as consent to broadcast an interview. It is therefore essential that reporters clearly identify themselves before conducting an interview and only seek details of a witness's name from the person involved. In this case, both these obligations were breached.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would suggest it should be a requirement of all media organisations that full permission be obtained before an interview with a witness to a crime is broadcast, or reference made to the witness's name, yet it appears that the media organisations place the onus on the person interviewed to request an interview not be broadcast. This is a completely unsatisfactory and unreasonable expectation, given the state of mind of most ordinary people who are confronted with violent and frightening incidents such as this one.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second very serious area of concern in this case is the release of the witness's name to the media by the police. This action can only be described as irresponsible in the extreme. Witnesses to such incidents come forward and provide information to the police in the expectation that this information will be confidential. Police officers would surely be aware of the risk to witnesses in situations where the offender is still at large and knows he has been clearly identified, particularly in a case where it is believed that gangland figures are involved.

      <para>
       (2) and (3) Cockatoo Island has a secondary (biological) sewage treatment plant, which is operated and maintained by the lessee of the Island, and which discharges its treated output into the waters surrounding the Island. Regular tests of the sewage output are conducted by the Australian Construction Services, to monitor conformance to the NSW State Pollution Control Commission guidelines. The Island also has a basic treatment system for liquid waste generated by the industrial processes of the Dockyard. This system periodically discharges into the sewage treatment plant. The sewage treatment plant cannot satisfactorily cope with injections of liquid trade waste if the injections are large or inadequately neutralised in the basic treatment system. Consequently, on occasions in the past, the allowable levels for a small number of restricted substances have been exceeded. Over the past years a number of studies have been conducted by the Commonwealth to establish a cost-effective method of handling and disposing of the industrial wastes generated on the Island. As a result of the studies, in 1984 the Dockyard operator introduced rigorous work programs designed to reduce and control the amounts of industrial waste generated by the Dockyard. Also large monthly shipments of industrial waste now are taken by a contractor off the Island for safe disposal. The Government has already announced its intention not to renew the current lease when it expires in December 1992 and has called for expressions of interest in relation to proposals to purchase the Island. In its deliberations on the future of the Island, the Government is taking into account the need to vary existing arrangements for the handling and disposal of industrial and sewage waste liquids.

       (4) The NSW State Pollution Control Commission has access to Cockatoo Island in accordance with the standing Commonwealth guidelines on access by non Commonwealth and non company employees, wherein a formal request for such access will normally be granted.
