         —I am not aware of what the Treasury has put to the Senate today. I would doubt very much that that would be a Treasury view. I make it quite clear to the Opposition that this country should take seriously the need to develop a pool of national savings and to provide off budget for the demographic shift in the population which is going to occur when the baby boom generation turns 65. If that is not done now, it will never be done. That is why there has to be a policy not only of a decent retirement income position and at the same time being able to build upon the building block of our retirement age system, the age pension, and additions to the age pension—that is, levels of retirement income in excess of the age pension through private provision with superannuation—but, on top of that, building a pool of national savings as well.

         —You mean `Flexiback'. I would have thought that the Opposition would have had enough sense to see that, for the first time ever under the accord processes, this Government has encouraged the organised work force to agree to take 10 per cent of its income as savings rather than as cash. It has never been done before; it has never been achieved before. The importance of that acceptance by the trade unions' membership will be a significant factor in Australia's investment future in terms of savings and, in terms of living standards, a better standard of living in retirement. Rather than rabbiting on again with ideological obsessions about the power of trade unions and about their control over investment funds and all of the other phobias, which this phobia-ridden crowd opposite have, what they should do is basically support the Government and try to see the spread of occupational superannuation throughout Australia.

         Once again, we are probably in a position where the Deputy Leader did not bother to read what was put in front of him or, if he did, he certainly did not understand it, because that is not what the OECD report said. The OECD report listed the pros and the cons of a new consumption tax. Amongst the reservations which were listed were `the risks involved for macro-economic management, the disruption to business and the difficulties of adequately compensating households for the price effects of GST'.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I want to turn to and particularly emphasise this area of risk to macro-economic management. The Minister for Finance, in a statement on 16 December last year, when he produced the Treasury and Tax Office costings of the revenue side of the Opposition's package, stressed that in the second year of the Opposition's proposed three-year program there would be a major relaxation of Budget policy. It is perfectly appropriate to have a relaxation of Budget policy or fiscal policy in circumstances where you are trying to stimulate growth in the economy but, in the middle year in which it is proposed that this relaxation should occur, the economy would already be growing fairly robustly in response to the initiatives which this Government has taken and which will continue in the course of the next couple of years. At that time my colleague said that if you were to provide this stimulus at that point, in the 1994-95 year, then this would cause the monetary authorities to have to respond with high interest rates in order to deal with this extra stimulus coming from the package. But I am advised that the budgetary relaxation that my colleague was referring to is much worse than was thought at the time that he made the statement.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I have been advised by the Treasury and the Tax Office that there was an error in the calculation made at that time, and I will explain what that error was. The coalition proposed to introduce its new tax on 1 October 1994. In the arithmetic of Fightback the coalition assumed that there would be nine months of the new tax collected during that financial year. The Tax Office and the Treasury took this at face value but, although the tax may be in operation for nine months, the Tax Office would not collect nine months worth of revenue. This is for the reason that the Opposition has been running around telling businesses that they would not have to pay the tax immediately. In fact, the Opposition says that the largest businesses in Australia would be required to submit GST returns each month and pay the tax on or before the end of the following month; businesses with current turnovers below $24m would be required to submit their returns every two months and pay the tax on or before the end of the month following that; and the smallest businesses would be able to submit GST returns on a six monthly basis and hand over the tax within a month after the end of that period.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         There would be a major delay in the collection of GST which would impact quite significantly on that first year of its operation. The Opposition is saying that this includes great benefits for business, ignoring the fact that any alleged benefit for taxpayers becomes a cash flow problem for the Tax Office. So, at the absolute minimum, these lags in the collection of this new tax would mean that we would not see the generation of nine months worth of revenue, but rather no more than eight months revenue and probably less than that.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         So, on the basis of the Liberals' own calculation, this would see a reduction in the collections which they assume of $2.263 billion—another $2.2 billion reduction in the estimated revenue. The calculation that has been made has been very generous, and I want to make one further qualification just to err on the side of fairness as far as the Opposition is concerned. In collecting less GST, those opposite would, although they have not realised it themselves—

         —As I said, the collections of wholesale sales tax would be rather larger than estimated in Fightback. So the actual hole in the first year of the operation of the GST is $1 1/2 billion dollars. Of course, this has enormous consequences for the management of the economy at the time. It is an enormous relaxation of fiscal policy during that year and it would have implications for the monetary authorities whom the Opposition would instruct to act totally autonomously in the face of this budgetary relaxation. So the suggestion that there would be a tightening of monetary policy is even a more acute problem for the Opposition as a result of this problem.

         It has been my duty from time to time to draw attention to the erroneous arithmetic of the Leader of the Opposition. Once again, I find myself in that position today. As a result of this $1 1/2 billion extra hole in Fightback, we now see the credibility gap expanding to $5 1/2 billion. It is a $5 1/2 billion hole coming from a person who prides himself on his own particular learning. What the Leader of the Opposition has done to arithmetic is what the former Premier of Queensland used to do to the English language.

        He said, `almost stitched up'; there was no arrangement agreed. The one amendment the Opposition sought was to change the name of the Bill, which we agreed to.

        What was on offer was some massive investment in Tasmania—and, indeed, Geelong and Melbourne. My colleague the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) and others would point out the parlous state of the Tasmanian economy, and the Government has walked away from $1.5 billion of possible investment in Tasmania; $600m of investment at Maryvale; and a potential $2 billion investment in south-east New South Wales and East Gippsland in Victoria.

        Knowing all that and despite all the bleating about jobs and development, all the crocodile tears, cynically, wilfully, wantonly, the Leader of the Opposition put resource security down and, with it, the interests of a pulp mill in Tasmania. He put down the interests of the Tasmanian people, a relatively small community in Australia by way of the State's relying upon large developments. He put asunder their interests for nothing more than grubby, shabby political motives.

The fact is that you have been exposed for the opportunists that you are.

         The Leader of the Opposition is always up talking about jobs. He could never create any when he was advising the former Government. He was happy to swan off into public life with double digit unemployment when we arrived in office in 1983, happy to put the 1.8 million jobs we created in the period in his pocket. He is up with crocodile tears but the moment you put up any test for him that is in any way difficult to vote for, for example, large numbers of jobs in very significant industries, it goes down. The fact is that he is simply no good when it comes to jobs and to the long term future of industrial development in Australia.

         My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Can the Minister advise the House whether he intends to meet soon with sugar industry leaders in order to discuss the future of the industry? Is he aware of an industry plan to increase the income of canegrowers by $8,000?

         I thank the honourable member for Kennedy for his question. I will be meeting with the canegrowers' representatives this afternoon and I understand that they have already met this morning with the honourable member for Hinkler whom I have asked to chair an industry committee to develop an industry strategy.

         The reason for establishing this committee is that the canegrowers are but one dimension of the sugar industry, an important dimension, granted. But what we really need to do is to tackle the refiners and the millers as well as the manufacturers. This group will bring them together. Honourable members opposite as well as the canegrowers should have regard to the successful outcome in the dairy industry that has been applauded in rural sectors. It was achieved last week after I sat down over a number of months with the dairy industry to work out a plan for its future.

         As to the second part of the question, I am aware of suggestions made as recently as last week in this House of a so-called $8,000 benefit for canegrowers. This was made by the Leader of the National Party when he got up in the Parliament and claimed to have been misrepresented because I had not completed a quote in relation to an interview he had with Laurie Oakes. The bit that was left out was to this effect:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Cane growers also directly and indirectly will have a benefit of about $8,000 per cane grower—
       </para>
       <para>
        by inference, if the GST package is introduced. The reason I did not go on to quote that was that had I done so I would have been guilty of misrepresenting the truth. The fact of the matter is that that $8,000 figure simply does not stand up. It is a figure that the Deputy Leader of the National Party has worked out on the back of an envelope by taking the Treasury's estimate of aggregate savings to the whole of the agriculture sector and dividing it by the number of farmers. The problem is that the number of farmers is wrong by ABARE's own analysis. The ABARE survey excludes all farms below a $20,000 per year cash value output. In other words, to start with, it excludes about 30,000 to 40,000 farms, an additional one-third more than is used in his calculation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In addition to that, the figure that he divides into from the Treasury document does not include just farmers in the agriculture sector; it includes forestry, fisheries and hunting. Not only do we have a position in which the number of farms is wrong, but the figure itself in relation to the farm sector is also wrong. The $8,000 is an absolute fiction.

         —Again it comes to the point that, whenever the National Party gets itself into strife, it will say anything to extricate itself. The other point that ought to be noted is that the very Treasury document that the Deputy Leader of the National Party used to do the calculations, which his Leader has blindly followed, also says that 60 per cent of small businesses and farmers will be worse off. In addition, our own calculations suggest that, for every one per cent increase in inflation, the cost to the farm sector, not just to the canegrowers, will go up by $1,200 per farm. I tell you what: it is a great package!

         Why is it that those opposite deliberately misrepresent this position? The reason is simple:  the coalition, and the National Party in particular, will do anything and say anything to preserve the coalition unity. They will do it at any cost because the National Party leadership has determined that its most effective means for winning government is to prop up the coalition at any cost. You have not been taken seriously by the Liberal Party. You were not included in the process of industry development that is contained in Fightback. For the benefit of anyone who needs a quote in terms of where the Liberal Party sees the National Party, the honourable member for Bennelong as recently as 4 May in an interview with Michelle Grattan said:

        What do you really stand for?  You have effectively sold out and you represent no effective voice in this chamber for the rural constituency which you claim to represent. That selling out has already led to tensions within the National Party, with one resignation to date and a split within the National Party that is put between 10 : 9 and, giving it its best focus, 11 : 8. That is a great outcome for what you were calling for in remembrance of the great icons of your Party and the Party you have built. You have split it. You represent no-one.

         —Over the whole course of this Government, since April 1983, the monthly average of working days lost is less than half the average of working days lost under the previous Government. The accord has brought a zero inflation rate now and a commitment to low inflation outcomes for the future, together with the lowest level of industrial disputes on record. Today under the accord we are moving cooperatively to expand the coverage of enterprise bargaining and increase national savings, as I mentioned earlier in response to a question from the Leader of the Opposition about employment-based superannuation. There has been more workplace reform in Australia in the last two years than in the previous 20, and it continues. But if we contrast this with the announced policy of the Opposition—

This House gets a 30-second answer on what the Government has done and up to five minutes on what the Opposition is supposed to do. The Prime Minister has apparently answered the question. He has even stopped reading from his own notes. He should therefore bring the answer to a conclusion at that point and let even some of his own back bench get on with answering some questions in this place.

But, no, what the Leader of the Opposition has in store is the most disruptive industrial relations policy that this country has ever seen. The big bang which those opposite referred to will be the big bang in relations between Australian employers and Australian employees as six million people in this country are deprived of their current legal entitlement to wages, annual leave, sick leave, redress against unfair dismissal—the lot. As the lot goes, those opposite expect to be able to sell to business in this country that the election of a coalition government will see a better industrial relations climate, more conducive inflation rates, better productivity—

It is not in a situation to do so. It is the same with the Opposition's health policy: it cannot cover the game and that is why it continues to avoid it, continues to obfuscate and say that it will not support the fee relief system and talks around tax rebates.

         No-one is fooled by averages, not when it comes to the policies that come from the Opposition. The redistribution and the regressivity of Fightback is the total issue in this whole child-care package. People will not be fooled by your proposals. The sooner you bring out your child-care policies so that people who are now enjoying the genuine fee relief system, which is fair and generous to people who need it the most, can see the regressivity of your proposals, the better.

         —Yesterday's figures for dwelling approvals show an increase of almost 7 per cent in March 1992 and put beyond any doubt recovery in the housing sector. These favourable results have been brought about by an achievement of the highest level of affordability since September 1985. That improvement in affordability has come about for two reasons: firstly, that interest rates have fallen and many home purchasers can now obtain mortgages at rates around 9 per cent; and, secondly, and as importantly, the median price of first houses has fallen.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Home buyers in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth are benefiting not just from falling interest rates but also from lower house prices. On a national basis, the median price of a first house fell from $118,700 in December to $114,200 in the March quarter. That reflects increasing activity at the lower end of the market. Mr Silberberg of the Housing Industry Association said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The reduction in the medium home price reflected an increase in sales at the lower priced end of the market. Reductions in home loan rates have increased dramatically borrowing capacity enabling more lower income and first home buyers to purchase a home.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is this question of affordability that is sustaining the recovery in terms of the housing market. It reflects availability of lower cost housing and that, in turn, reflects the emphasis that the Government has placed on Green Street, the Australian model code for residential development. We are increasingly seeing developed estates that reflect affordability as a prime concern.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Government will continue to work with the States to develop programs to reduce the cost of housing. Indeed, sustainability of recovery depends on sustaining affordability. But the difference with the Opposition is quite stark. This time when the news is good for home buyers and builders, the Opposition continues with its plan to increase house prices. The Parliament is now familiar with the fact that the Opposition would force up the cost of new houses by about $3,000 through the imposition of a GST. In addition, it would lift the costs of agents' and solicitors' fees and the cost of furnishing and renovations through the GST. These price hikes would wipe out the gains made by home buyers after the last six months.

The issue I wish to raise is the Government's failure to maintain control of entry to Australia for permanent settlement. The specific matter that I wish to canvass relates to the way in which Chinese students in Australia have been accommodated, especially by this Government, not only by decisions taken by the former Prime Minister and his Government but compounded by further statements made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) since that time.

         The concern of honourable members opposite who constitute the Labor Party's immigration committee suggested to me that this matter ought to be raised at this time. The committee chairman, the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), last night had the audacity to endorse the action of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) in maintaining the integrity of Australia's immigration program, particularly the refugee component. The committee expressed concern that the integrity of the program was under public attack with calls for Cambodian boat people who have jumped the queue to be given residence in Australia, irrespective of the outcome of their applications for refugee status. The committee's statement said:

        When I read that comment, I said to myself, `Hear, hear! The honourable member and his committee have it right'. They are basic principles that are fundamental to immigration, as is the principle that the government of the day should have the right to determine who shall, or shall not, be able to enter Australia and settle permanently. Another fundamental principle is that, in selecting applicants for immigration, immigration policy will not discriminate against applicants on the basis of their race, religion or country of origin.

         Every time those principles have been put to one side, flawed entry arrangements have occurred. The undermining of the integrity of our immigration process follows. It is the case that, when the Government abandoned that decision in relation to the 20,000 or so Chinese students who were here in Australia at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre, that situation arose. It was a decision that was wrong when the then Prime Minister made it, and it is wrong now.

Individual merit should have been the basis upon which these matters were assessed. Senator Ray's remarks can be found in the Senate

         We know that many of the students were at that time illegal immigrants. Senator Ray revealed that up to 40 per cent had overstayed their visas at that time. It was not as if it was without notice. We know from freedom of information requests obtained by my colleague the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) that when the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) was Minister he warned the then Prime Minister in March 1988 in relation to this question.

        . . . at the end of January 1988, 28 percent of 1987 ELICOS student arrivals had not left Australia despite the expiry of their entry permits and are now overstayed by up to 10 months, in part because of persistent rumours that an amnesty for illegal immigrants might occur. The data indicate that the overstay rate is increasing, and is especially high for students from the People's Republic of China and Korea. That overstay rate compares with an overstay rate of 1.5 percent for visitors to Australia.

        He went on to counsel the Government that it should change the  rules in relation to that matter. The Government did not change the rules. The Tiananmen Square massacre occurred. Large numbers of students were here. The Government of the day gave them temporary entry arrangements in the form of a four-year temporary entry visa, and the Government later allowed their spouses and dependent children to join them here in Australia and, of course, provided a range of services and benefits for them and gave them permission to work.

         This severely compromised Australia's immigration program because every other group of people who might want to make claims for refugee status believes that it is entitled to the same sort of concessional arrangement because of that decision. The fact of the matter is that people from Fiji—and there were thousands of people here from Fiji—wanted to make those claims. There were many people here from the Middle East who were concerned about their situation, and they also wanted to make those sorts of claims.

         That decision was so flawed that it undermined this Government's integrity in terms of consistently applying the principles of refugee determination. At every turn the Government is faced with this argument because it did not make the right decision at the time of the Tiananmen Square event. But the Government had the opportunity after that, and particularly after the lessons that were learned by the way in which that matter was dealt with, to correct the situation. It was in a position to make it clear to the Chinese students that, at the end of the four-year temporary entry period, the Government would revert, properly, to determining these matters case by case on the basis of a person's need for protection.

         We saw what happened to the refugee program generally when of the order of 25,000 students were allowed into Australia after the Tiananmen Square event, under what this Government loosely termed pipeline processing arrangements. Their bona fides were never checked because the Government was somewhat concerned about the demonstrations that were occurring in China at the time. One would have thought that, having then experienced about 17,000 of those people making claims for refugee status and effectively ensuring that the Government cannot deal with these matters without a substantial additional resourcing of the refugee determination process, without having to consider the framework of law under which these matters are determined, and without having to consider the additional cost to the Australian taxpayers—and I am reliably informed that, if we look at all of the areas associated with refugees, including the Chinese students, it will have cost the Australian taxpayer over half a billion dollars, three times more than the amount of money we want to allocate over time to deal with the black deaths in custody issue—this Government would have learned its lesson.

If they were able to make claims under the ordinary immigration criteria that any other applicant was able to make and which is consistently applied, such as spouse grounds or occupational grounds, of course they ought to be allowed to apply for a grant of resident status.

        So the same rules that apply to anybody else would apply to the post-Tiananmen Square students or nationals. But if they were those who were the subject of the special Hawke deal, they were still to be treated differently. This does not occur for any other group of nationals. When it occurred in relation to the Lebanese community, they were extensions of time of a limited duration, and the Minister brought them to an end, and those who were still here at that time had to go; in relation to the Sri Lankans, they are still of limited duration; and in relation to those from Yugoslavia, they are still of limited duration. This Government has put in place a flawed decision and it has been compounded by the actions of this Prime Minister. It puts at risk the very basis upon which we can continue to control immigration and refugee determination in this country.

         If the Government does not change it and does not walk away from this announcement by the Prime Minister, then the national interest is very severely compromised. That is why,  in the light of the statements made by honourable members opposite, we have brought home to them once again their failure in this regard, and we are giving them an opportunity to put the matter right by fresh announcements at this time.

         —I suppose responding to this matter of public importance had to occur because of the number of press releases being put out by the shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), over a long period. The current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) reinforced the decision of the Government as announced by the previous Prime Minister in the correspondence to the journal that the shadow Minister talked about.

         Let us restate the policy. The decision was made and the Prime Minister's letter to the editor said nothing new. It did no more or less than restate the policy announced by the Government on 27 June 1990. What will happen at the end of that four-year period? I invite honourable members to go back and look at the press statement that was issued by the Prime Minister at that time. It is quite clear that there is no automatic permanency for anybody at the end of the four years because the status of people at the end of that period will depend on conditions in China.

         People from the PRC who were in Australia on 20 June 1989 will have to apply for either a temporary entry permit or, depending on the circumstances in China, as referred to in the second paragraph of the Hawke statement, and subject to places in the migration program, a permanent resident's permit.

All applicants will have to satisfy certain criteria and be found a category within the permanent component of our intake. It is not right to say that X number of Chinese people resident in Australia at this point in time who were here in June 1989 will automatically be granted permanent residency in 1994—that is just not true.

I can remember Tiananmen Square because I was nearly knocked off the platform in the Melbourne Town Hall by an array of State and Federal members of the Liberal Party wanting to get up to the microphone to tell everybody how dreadful it was and how these people had to be looked after.

I invite the shadow Minister to look at the editorials and at what was said by members of his own Party. The problem with immigration is that everybody is an expert, including the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), two former immigration Ministers. Everybody has a million ideas about what is the best thing to do. They are on both sides of the Parliament, I might add, something particularly clear to me because those honourable members used to occupy my seat.

I ask him again to read that statement. It refers to having to pass normal health and character checks. The honourable member mentioned character checks.

I repeat that, if he looks at the statement, he will see that there is no automatic permanent residence for people; so it is wrong to allude to that. It is a fact that they ought not to be sent home against their will. The honourable member can shake his head; but there is a significant difference in immigration law on that point and he well knows it. That is the difference in the position that we are putting.

         The situation is a very difficult one. I reject the argument that the honourable member has put that that decision has jeopardised our immigration program. I think a number of factors led to the large number of people here. The honourable member has touched on some of them perhaps. But there was a combination of events. There was Tiananmen Square; there were a large number of people here at the time; and of course, there was the subject matter raised in the letter from the honourable member from Melbourne Ports to which the honourable member for Dundas alluded. There was a combination of events, so it is not correct to say that the single point that brought about this so-called dilemma was the announcement.

         I went to that meeting in the Melbourne Town Hall, and I think the honourable member for Calwell may have been there as well. It was a very moving ceremony, with some 10,000 or so people present. I remember the editorials the next day. I point out that at the time when the decision was made and the extension by Senator Robert Ray given, to which the honourable member referred, a press release from the honourable member on 8 December 1989 stated:

         —The Minister's policies are becoming the laughing-stock of the region, and the Australian community is red-hot angry at the farcical processes that are being presented as the administration of those policies. Let us look at the specific case of the Chinese students who were here before the Tiananmen Square massacre. In June 1989, 20,000 Chinese students in Australia were given four-year temporary visas to stay—to remain. This decision to grant those visas was virtually a unilateral decision of an emotionally influenced Prime Minister who, in one fell swoop, corrupted the immigration program of this country. As my colleague the honourable member for Dundas has mentioned, none of the usual checks were made, as these people were then temporary students studying the English language within Australia.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          This year about 14,000 dependants are expected to join the students in Australia; so we have a situation of about 34,000 people being involved. Of course, social security and other benefits were extended as a consequence.

         I put it to the Minister that this decision—this emotion-ridden decision by the former Prime Minister, compounded by the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating)—has very strongly militated against the community support for our refugee and humanitarian program. Furthermore, it has acted to encourage the belief that the due process of assessment on a case by case basis can be circumvented at the whim of an emotion-ridden Prime Minister or through the calculated application of political pressure on his party. I say `Prime Minister' without specifying whether it was the old one or the new one, because they seem to be equally flexible on this issue.

Here is the man who portrays himself as hard-headed, a decision-maker, firm, unswayed, who is going to bring a hard-headed, non-emotional perspective to the immigration issue. And at the first sign of pressure Prime Minister Keating caved in. In an effort to ingratiate himself with the Australian Chinese community, he has brought the final hammer down on the integrity of the Government's refugee and immigration program. He has put sectional interests above those of his nation. As I mentioned, it is in the same genre as the Kirribilli conspiracy; it is an effort to pander to one section of the community; it is typical of the Labor Government's general approach to policy-making in the current era. He has endorsed what many have said: it was bad policy. He has repeated bad policy by compounding it and by committing his Government to repeating it.

         The Government has lost control of entry to Australia. It has abdicated its authority with ephemeral and changing circumstances surrounding particular groups seeking residence in Australia. I ask: how does this best serve our community; how does it best serve the interests of those who genuinely seek asylum in Australia from political oppression or the rigours of warfare and destruction overseas? It is an inconsistent, even corrupted program, in the system of assessment, which delivers a compelling message to all those in the region aspiring to come to Australia via the refugee program: `Whatever you do, get into Australia; and if you are able to stay long enough, the political leaders will eventually buckle and let you stay'. Where is the compassion in that sort of policy? What sort of message is that to those languishing in the refugee camps of South East Asia, patiently waiting their turn in the queue? What a cruel ravaging of the expectations of those who come and are then later sent back.

I thought that the Opposition was finally going to acknowledge some of the changes to the immigration policy since this Government has been in power. But when I came into the House, what did I have to listen to? The shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), talked about the Chinese students, a statement that was made by a previous Prime Minister two years ago, on 27 June 1990, which all honourable members in this House would have to agree is even a bit old for the shadow Minister to start bringing forward to the House as a matter of public importance.

         I believe that it is also time for this House to hear that it was the Labor Government which began in 1983 which was responsive to the needs of the people throughout our world who had fled their countries after having suffered abuse of their human rights or various forms of discrimination, prosecution and persecution. In this time, it is our Government's refugee and special humanitarian resettlement programs which have provided the opportunity for thousands of people to resettle in Australia free of such discrimination. The Government has also provided humanitarian resettlement to the victims of disturbances, inter-communal conflict and civil war, not only in areas as diverse as Indo-China, Poland and Sri Lanka, but also in Afghanistan and countries in Central and South America. Once migrants are in Australia, our Government does not forget them; rather, it helps them to resettle.

         Let us look at the programs that this Government has introduced in the resettlement of those people.

This is centred around a more tightly integrated economic immigration policy with the Government's major macro-economic and micro-economic reform packages. The National Office of Overseas Skills Recognition was established to promote national standards for skill recognition, to encourage competency based assessments, to develop counselling and referral services, and to promote improvements to occupational regulations.

         There have been many reports into immigration over the last 10 years. In one particular report in 1988 a committee advised on Australia's immigration policies. The Government looked into and reformed the way in which overseas skills were treated in Australia. Skills is a category that the Opposition continually reiterates we need to have more of. What it does not keep bringing into debates on immigration is the fact that, if immigration levels were to stay at the present percentage, the population born overseas in the year 2031 would be 20 per cent, which is a little below the present 22 per cent. While migration requires additional investment in productive capital and infrastructure, in the long run an expanding population historically has increased economic output in similar proportion and has therefore provided the broad capacity to fund infrastructure and investment. The Opposition never brings that before the House. It also has not brought before the House a report of the Bureau of Immigration Research which was released in 1991. It stated:

        With the exception of those from Lebanon and Vietnam, immigrants of working age are less likely to receive a pension or benefit than their Australian born counterparts.

These results do not confirm the opinion sometimes expressed that immigrants are over-users of the social security system.

        This Bill makes changes to the merit review system established as part of the major amendments of the Migration Act in 1989. The changes are designed to enhance the position of the applicants for review. The Bill also increases penalties in the Act in line with Commonwealth criminal law policy and makes a number of other minor amendments.

         The Government, in 1989, established a two-tier merits review system of certain decisions under the Migration Act. The first tier is the Migration Internal Review Office (MIRO). The second tier is the Immigration Review Tribunal (IRT) which is an independent external review agency. As I noted in the House of Representatives on 17 April 1991 the objectives of the review system continue to be achieved. That is to say, the review system provides independent review which is fair, just, economical, informal and quick. Further legislative changes have been made to enhance the review system and I refer honourable members to the Migration Amendment Act 1991 which introduced a number of important changes.

         This Bill will make two further changes to the review system. Firstly, the Bill will clarify the matters which may be considered by MIRO or the IRT when reviewing an assessment under section 30 of the Act. Section 30 provides for an assessment to be made of an applicant's qualifications with points awarded for each qualification as prescribed in the Migration Regulations. It is a criterion for the grant of some visas that the applicant receive more than a specified number of points when assessed under section 30. At present the Act does not indicate whether MIRO or the IRT are required to consider changes to the Migration regulations, prescribing points for qualifications, which occur subsequent to the original decision on the application. It is possible that the points awarded for a particular qualification may increase or decrease in the period between the original decision and the review stage. The Bill will insert a new section 121A into the Act which will provide that points under section 30 are to be assessed by MIRO and the IRT in accordance with the regulations in force at the time of the original decision. However, if the regulations prescribing points and qualifications which are in force at the time of the review will lead to a more favourable outcome for the applicant, those regulations will apply instead.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The second change to the review system which will be effected by this Bill is a technical amendment to ensure that illegal entrants who may be invited by the IRT to lodge an application for an entry permit under section 121 are not prevented from doing so by section 37. Section 37 is designed to prevent illegal entrants from delaying their departure from Australia by lodging a sequence of applications for entry permits. That section was not intended, contrary to what one construction of the language might indicate, to prevent illegal entrants from lodging an application when invited to do so by a review authority. Section 37 will therefore be amended accordingly.

         I turn now to the issue of the level of penalties provided for offences created by the Act. Honourable members will appreciate that the Migration Act creates a number of criminal offences dealing with such matters as illegal entry to Australia, obstruction of officers, and escaping from custody. In line with the Government's determination to reduce the number of illegal entrants in Australia, the penalties provided in the Act have recently been reviewed.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The pecuniary penalties, provided as an alternative to imprisonment, were found to be below the levels now considered appropriate in terms of Commonwealth criminal law policy. That policy is expressed in section 4B(2) of the Crimes Act 1914 and provides that maximum pecuniary penalties are to be determined in accordance with a formula whereby six months of imprisonment equates to $3,000. For example, the offence of escaping from custody in section 171 of the Act currently has a penalty of $5,000 or imprisonment for two years or both. These are, of course, the maximum penalties which a court may impose. Under the proposed amendment the penalty set out in the Migration Act will be two years imprisonment. However, application of the formula in section 4B(2) of the Crimes Act—$3,000 per six months of imprisonment—will increase the maximum pecuniary penalty from $5,000 to $12,000.

         The offences in the Migration Act which will not be subject to the formula in section 4B(2) of the Crimes Act are those where no imprisonment option is provided. The majority of those penalties will also be increased to maintain relativity with the penalties derived under section 4B(2).

         In addition I should mention those offences relating to the arranging of non-genuine relationships for the purpose of securing permanent residence in Australia. Persons who arrange contrived relationships to defeat Australia's migration laws will risk penalties of $100,000 or 10 years imprisonment or both. These penalties were introduced recently in the Migration Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 and reflect the need for a more substantial deterrent in this area than would be provided by the application of the section 4B(2) formula.

         References to powers of arrest will be removed from sections 92 and 93 and from a number of related sections to ensure that no confusion arises between the powers under the Act to take persons into what might be termed `migration custody' and the power to arrest persons for criminal offences.

         Officers who exercise powers under the Migration Act to take persons into custody do so for specific purposes under the Migration Act related to migration processing and/or removal from Australia. Those powers are, therefore, not subject to the restrictions set out in the Crimes Act 1914 which apply to the power to arrest persons for criminal offences. However, to make this distinction absolutely clear the term `arrest' has been removed from a number of sections of the Act and replaced with the term `detain in custody'.

         I will now deal with the proposed amendments to section 20 of the Act. Section 20 identifies a number of matters which would result in a person becoming an illegal entrant unless those matters are disclosed in a notice under section 20. For example, a person suffering from a prescribed disease or a prescribed physical or mental condition must disclose that fact in a section 20 notice. If a visa or entry permit is subsequently granted to the person who has made the required disclosure that visa or entry permit must be endorsed with a statement that the person is recognised to be a person to whom section 20 applies. In other words a person who has, for example, a prescribed disease, must have that fact acknowledged on their visa or entry permit.

         The migration regulations currently permit the endorsement to be in the form of a code recognisable only by departmental officers. Despite this, the requirement for an endorsement can cause embarrassment or offence to some persons. The proposed amendment will provide that the obligation to endorse the visa or entry permit will be satisfied if the information is recorded in a departmental database. A number of other minor technical amendments will be made by the Bill. These are explained adequately in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.

         I now wish to foreshadow major Government amendments to the Bill which I will move during the committee stage. The Government is conscious of the extraordinary nature of the measures which will be implemented by the amendment aimed at boat people. I believe it is crucial that all persons who come to Australia without prior authorisation not be released into the community. Their release would undermine the Government's strategy for determining their refugee status or entry claims. Indeed, I believe it is vital to Australia that this be prevented as far as possible. The Government is determined that a clear signal be sent that migration to Australia may not be achieved by simply arriving in this country and expecting to be allowed into the community.

         Australia will, of course, continue to honour its statutory and international obligations as it always has done. Any claims made by these people will be fully and fairly considered under the available processes, and any persons found to qualify for Australia's protection will be allowed to enter. Until the process is complete, however, Australia cannot afford to allow unauthorised boat arrivals to simply move into the community.

         The Government has no wish to keep people in custody indefinitely and I could not expect the Parliament to support such a suggestion. Honourable members will note that the amendment calls for custody for a limited period. The period provided for in the amendment is 273 days—this translates into nine months. This period is, however, restricted to that time where consideration of a person's claims is directly within the control of my Department. Where factors are outside the control of my Department, the period is suspended. For example, where it is up to the applicant to provide information relevant to a claim, the time taken to provide that information would not be included in the period.

         Honourable members will understand that although under optimum conditions new procedures allow for the processing of border claimants in about two months, there is at present no guarantee that the process cannot be delayed. It would be a concern if that could occur. The amendment provides the incentive for the parties involved in the process not to embark on tactics calculated to delay the final processing of claims. For its part, the Government has no desire to keep these people in custody longer than necessary and would prefer that a proper decision is made as quickly as possible. Indeed, it has acted throughout this process with the aim of expediting the finalisation of cases.

         The amendment provides that those boat people already in Australia will be in the new custody from the date this Bill receives the royal assent. In other words, the 273 days will commence on that date. For those unauthorised boat people who arrive in Australia between 27 April and 1 December this year, custody will start when the person is detained. The 273 days will start on the day that the detainee makes an application. The formula for suspending the period applies once the 273-day period starts.

I hope, for example, to address the present complexities of the current powers in the Act to detain non-citizens. Such a revised scheme will be of significant benefit to those responsible for administering our migration law, as well as to those subject to it, in terms of simplicity, clarity and fairness.

These amendments clarify the regulations a review authority is to have regard to in a review of a points assessment under section 30 of the Act; distinguish the power to detain a person under sections 92 and 93 of the Act from the power of arrest in the Crimes (Investigation of Commonwealth Offences) Amendment Act 1991; increase certain penalties under the Act in line with Commonwealth criminal law policy and allow consistent application of pecuniary penalties under the Crimes Act; provide that where an endorsement is recorded in a notified database, that will satisfy the obligation to endorse a visa or an entry permit where this is a requirement under subsections 20(4) or (5); and ensure that  illegal entrants are not further prevented by section 37 from making a further application, within the period allowed by the Act.

         The matters which were the purport of the original Bill introduced and passed in the Senate, subject to certain minor amendments, and introduced into this House today, meet with no objection from the Opposition. In relation to the amendments the Minister foreshadowed today in his second reading speech, which he will introduce later, the Opposition is very conscious that there are some 389 boat people in detention around Australia under the current provisions of the Migration Act. There are also, in contemplation, others who may arrive in Australian territorial waters seeking to enter Australia without proper and adequate documentation obtained in advance.

         Under the current provisions of the Migration Act, it is possible that the courts can release people into the community before any claims that I might be making for protection are considered or before any entry permit might be granted to a person in accordance with the law. It is our view that no court should have the authority to undertake the release of people into the community contrary to the express wish of the Parliament, expressed in the Migration Act, as to the basis upon which entry permits will be granted. In other words, having eliminated any discretion from Ministers and ourselves, subject to only two specific sections in the Act, I and my colleagues do not believe that any other body should operate under its discretion or inherent powers to release people into the community contrary to the law.

         It is a fact that the law in this area is complex and difficult. Detainees can be held under section 88 of the Act, which deals with those who have been arrested at sea and brought ashore by Australian authorities as prohibited entrants, or under section 92, which deals with those people who have landed without adequate documentation and who are otherwise illegal entrants and are taken into custody after their arrival.

         The amendments that the Minister has foreshadowed are designed to provide for continued detention of all current detainees, and those who might arrive at a later date, while this legislation is in operation. Such people will be held in custody under those provisions for a period of nine months. They have to prosecute any claims they might have for protection as refugees, and they have to do so expeditiously. If they fail to prosecute those matters, or fail to get evidence that is available, the timeframe in which they can be kept will, in effect, stop and the time will run from when they have done all they have to do.

         I think the Minister would acknowledge that this legislation is seen as tough. I imagine it will not be unchallenged, but I think it needs to be clearly understood that it has the very strong support of the Opposition. We are of the view that the current powers of arrest and the basis on which people are detained are sufficiently cumbersome, outdated and silent as to leave doubt in the minds of some as to whether or not people held in custody can continue to be so held. If that is a weakness, it needs to be cured. This legislation is designed to cure that. It is clear from the terms of the legislation that it in no way alters the obligations we have to offer protection to genuine refugees, as defined by the UN conventions and protocols. The legislation specifically notes that those rights are not affected.

         The fact is, however, that along with other countries we have seen a very significant increase in asylum claims over the last decade. As was heard in the earlier discussion—I hold the Government accountable for much of this—the fact is that we are having to deal with an increase in claims for refugee status from just on 500 claims a year to something of the order of 23,000. Although we have no land borders and are not subjected to the same pressures that are placed on other countries such as eastern Europe or the Americas, we are particularly vulnerable, particularly with new and modern navigational aids, to an increasing number of people seeking to make the journey here by sea.

In such a way, they will be able to remain here and argue that they have been absorbed into the Australian community and never removed.

Under judicial review, there is the possibility of three further stages: a judge at single instance; the Full Court of the Federal Court; and, if people get leave, the High Court of Australia. Certainly, the Opposition recognises that the High Court cannot be denied. Provisions under the Constitution enable it to exercise original jurisdiction. But we are certainly of the view that the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act, as it extends to this area of immigration law, ought to be amended to exclude this area.

         The Government's program has been the subject of very widespread criticism because it does not meet the needs of the national economy. Clearly, it does not have the support of the Australian people, and I suggest that is one of the reasons the Government will be moving to change its policy in this regard. In the middle of the worst recession in 60 years, it is clear that the Australian economy cannot sustain a large influx of new migrants. There are budgetary constraints which mean that settlement services are being cut back and that they are unable to meet the present needs.

         This is the first time that this country, in a period of recession, has had a program that has held up in the way in which it has. The reason that it has not fallen off, as it did in the past, is that the skills testing that goes on is not related to the labour market. That was a decision taken by the Minister and his colleagues. Access to benefits has been liberalised by the Minister and his colleagues, to the point where people who would not be able to access benefits in their home country seek to come here knowing that they are eligible immediately.

We do not want to make migrants scapegoats, but we do believe that, in the context of the worst recession in over 60 years, we cannot absorb large numbers of migrants in the way in which this Government has insisted that we do in this recession. In previous recessions we saw the program come off very significantly. I have given those figures before. I simply note that one of the Government's own publications says that in the 1984 recession the program was reduced from a proposed program of 90,000 to 62,000 in  recognition  of  a  tight  labour  market and  reduced  interest among people  to migrate here. That reduced interest was in  the concessional family categories, in particular.

         We in the Opposition have made the point that there are a number of decisions that can be taken by the Government to ensure that the program more effectively reflects the national interest. We have emphasised the importance of ensuring that testing of bona fides is properly carried out in those areas which are demand driven. Those areas include the preferential family stream, where we believe it is quite appropriate for the Government to introduce concessional migrant entry in the same way as concessional migrant entry is granted for people who, on spouse or de facto grounds, seek a change in status in Australia on the basis of their relationship with an Australian. Those coming from overseas could be put to the same requirement. In my view that would significantly test those who enter into marriage or de facto relationships purely for the purpose of migration entry.

In relation to eligibility for benefits, we have made it very clear that it is part of the Fightback package proposals that, save for refugees and those in the humanitarian stream, we would not provide benefits unless there had been a marked change in circumstances.

Never in a period of recession of very much less severity than this one have we had programs that have exceeded 70,000 net as an outcome. On the basis of past experience and on the basis of the advice that the Government has had from its own specialist advisers—the National Population Council, the Auditor-General, the Department of Finance, the Treasury and the Department of Social Security—and from members of the Government's own back bench, there is very good reason why these adjustments should be made.

         I think that what the Opposition is about was demonstrated by its Leader (Dr Hewson) when he was very unfairly attacked by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on the ground of racism. There is nothing racist at all about what the Leader of the Opposition was saying. It was quite a scurrilous attack. In defending himself, the Leader of the Opposition said, `Of course, when the economy improves we will vastly increase immigration'. He then added, `If we don't, somebody else will do it for us'. So those opposite would not only vastly increase immigration, they would also give away Australia's sovereignty, which is something I thought we had invested heavily in with the F111s, purchased by the Liberal Party, to defend our national sovereignty.

         Anyone who takes the time to look past his or her nose and into the so-called refugee issue will realise that the whole thing is a rort. I commend the increased penalties announced in this Migration Amendment Bill, especially those relating to immigration agents who arrange false marriages in order to facilitate legal immigration. These agents who rort the system in this and other ways are the scum of the earth. They do not give a damn about this country or its best interests;  all they care about is a quick buck, and they are never slow to claim humanitarian motives.

         I have no objection to the proposed amendment to section 20 of the Act regarding diseases, so long as the health of the host community is adequately protected. The information on diseases of migrants must not be allowed to just sit in some immigration department database if it is likely to impact on the local community. Information must be passed on to the relevant Commonwealth and particularly State authorities. The inquiries of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations of March this year into conditional entry made it clear that important medical information has not been passed on by the Immigration  Department  to  the relevant State authorities. Health monitoring has been compromised as a result. I stress again that the Immigration Department must ensure that information regarding diseases is promptly passed on to the relevant authorities. I must say that the inquiries of the Joint Standing Committee were welcome, if belated.

I also put a question to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) on notice at the same time. It is clear that the health of the host community has been placed under threat in the past, largely, I believe, out of fear of being branded racist if stricter health screening and subsequent rejections had been enforced. This is only one of the ways that Australian governments have been gutless in regard to immigration matters. They have placed the health of the very people they are charged to protect under threat for motives that were, at the very least, very questionable.

The combination of administrative review and legal review that we have at present is causing undue delay and compromising the entire review process. It allows for rorts in the system to be continued.

Guilt was never the basis for a sensible clear-headed policy, but it permeates our current immigration policy and attitudes to Asia. Each one of the guilt-ridden policies has been imposed from above. Multiculturalism, which was foreshadowed in the Whitlam Government by Al Grassby, was adopted as official policy in the late 1970s by the Fraser Government which followed.

         In 1979 the immigration Minister of the day, Ian Macphee, introduced a family reunion category for which those groups had been calling. In opposition the ALP had also pushed for such a change, and in the late 1970s had established an exclusive Greek-speaking branch in Victoria in the battle over the so-called ethnic vote. However, for all the claims that these groups represented a widespread demand in their communities, very few Greek and Italian people took advantage of the new category to bring out relatives. More British people took advantage of it, but the big users of the new category were Asians. So Asian immigration increased considerably as an unintended consequence of the appeasement of Greek and Italian pressure groups.

         It was not until the mid-1980s that the social engineers saw the potential of such immigration and developed a deliberate policy of Asianisation. It was justified as a way of linking in with the region and increasing our trade with Asia. But as the multiculturalist lobby power grew, such things as English language testing were relaxed. This had nothing to do with what was best for the country. As a result, large numbers of unskilled people with little or no English were accepted. How they would help improve our trade with Asia, particularly when many of them were unemployed, was never explained. It is interesting to note that trade with Hong Kong has gone down over this period, and not up.

         The immigration industry continues to grow, and to understand its influence we have to look at and understand the network. We now have the Office of Multicultural Affairs—OMA—within the Prime Minister's Department. It was established there by Bob Hawke in 1985, and its staff were vetted by the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia—FECCA—which itself depends on government funding. The first head of OMA was the academic adviser to FECCA, Dr Peter Shergold. He is now the head of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. I will return to this connection later.

         OMA acts as a propaganda unit for the policy of multiculturalism and requires all departments to submit to its discipline on so-called `access and equity' requirements. Increasingly, it is working closely with the Bureau of Immigration Research, the Immigration Department's own propaganda unit, which was established under the Hawke Government in 1988. Both of these organisations are assisted in their aims by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, particularly through Commissioner Irene Moss, whose specialty is racial discrimination. She was largely responsible for a report into racist violence in Australia which only targeted those white Australians whose forebears arrived here before the Second World War, and others of basically `Anglo-Celtic' descent. No consideration at all was given to inter-ethnic violence between migrant groups, which is a far bigger problem in Australia.

         Moss began with the intention of documenting racist violence against Asians by whites, but did not find enough to justify her inquiry. So she turned to relations between whites and Aboriginals. The bulk of her report turns on this aspect and largely duplicates the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, which was already under way. Incidentally, the Royal Commission was agreed to in 1988, the Bicentennial year, when the Hawke Government feared that Aboriginal groups might disrupt the celebrations. In the previous years there had been considerable publicity given to a number of Aboriginal deaths in custody. It was widely believed that far more Aboriginals died in custody than whites. In fact, it was soon discovered that proportionally more whites died in custody than blacks—not only numerically, but proportionally. This, of course, did not stop the Royal Commission.

         Both the Moss report and the Royal Commission have been used by professional multiculturalists to press for increases in their own powers and the power of bureaucracies. As far as Aboriginal affairs goes, Aboriginal activist Gary Foley has remarked that what Nugget Coombs said in 1974—that about three-quarters of Aboriginal affairs money goes to white bureaucrats—still holds good, although a lot of these white bureaucrats have now been joined by what I would term professional Aboriginals. So the multiculturalists and their bureaucracies use Aboriginals to expand their own empires and have for some time wanted to make Aboriginal affairs part of their empire. Although this has met considerable hostility from Aboriginals, the appointment of the former head of OMA, Dr Peter Shergold, to head ATSIC shows that they have at least been partly successful.

He has put forward a proposal for immigration zones which is clearly designed to give more weight to immigration from southern and eastern Europe. This has been pushed once again by Greek and Italian professional ethnics. It is ironic that, in spite of all the influence they have exerted, they still think that the immigration program works against them. It is also ironic that vested interest groups need a cover to push their own demands.

Recently Greek and Italian pressure groups claimed that they were being discriminated against by SBS radio programming which gave less weight to their programs.

But it was their pressures which changed the immigration policy and allowed many of the more recent migrants to come here in the first place.

         There is a proper concern amongst the Australian people about the possibility of exotic diseases being brought to Australia and transmitted to the Australian community by unscreened migrants. This is a very difficult area because it is an emotional one. I noticed that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie talked about hepatitis B and tuberculosis. One of the medical checks which was in place for many years was a requirement for intending migrants to be screened for tuberculosis.

          We do need to make sure that the legal system does not preclude the government of the day and the Minister of the day from exercising their responsibilities properly. I think that has occurred to a very great extent, and I am very pleased to see that the amendments coming before the House today go at least some way towards resolving that problem.

         Another area that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie talked about was the protection of the Australian culture, as though the Australian culture is something written on tablets of stone and has not been altered over the many years since European settlement in Australia, which is again simply nonsense. Again, in this immigration debate we do need to understand that culture, if it is to have any significance at all, is a living, breathing entity and changes as the community changes and as time passes. If it did not, we would be in a very difficult situation indeed.

         I place on record my belief that immigration programs of the past—not just since the Second World War—have had a very significant and beneficial effect on the development of Australian culture, and I hope will continue to do so. It always intrigues me when those people within Australia who are themselves migrants or the descendants of migrants want to lock the door and say, `Nobody else can come in. We are all right, Jack. Pull up the ladder and let's stop everything here'. I do not know the family history of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie but I will bet London to a brick that it is not very long since his family or he was a migrant to Australia.

         When looking at this total migration debate, one has to keep very much in mind the development of migration procedures and an understanding of those people already in Australia, of course, but also those people wishing to come to Australia. Having done that, it seems to me that we are really facing in the future a situation which we have not faced as a nation before. The potential for refugee arrival in Australia is at a level which we really have not faced before. Our refugee procedures need to take into account the potential that lies around us.

         One of the saddest issues in the world today concerns the fate of refugees. One cannot go to any continent in the world—with the exception of Australia—where there are not significant refugee problems and an increasing number of people who come into the category of refugees. Australia simply cannot deal with all those who seek asylum and resettlement, and therefore any government needs to make very clear decisions as to what can be achieved, how many people can be catered for in the refugee category and who they will be.

         At this stage I do not believe that we have a clear delineation from the Government as to how that selection procedure is to be handled; it is an area which needs further attention. I would hate to see a situation develop in Australia where we needed to have refugee camps. That would be a dreadful thing, and I hope that procedures are put in place that will obviate this necessity. But I think—and the evidence is clearly before us—that the current situation cannot be supported. Here again I agree with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie; although I would not use the phrases that he did, I certainly agree with his sentiments when he said that one of the great problems that we face came about because of an emotional reaction by the previous Prime Minister to the events in Tiananmen Square. It is disgraceful what has occurred as a result of that. It has been very unfair.

         I acknowledge the attitude and the words of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand), who is at the table, when he said that it was an extremely emotional time. It certainly was, and one of the most difficult things to do at an emotional time is to keep in one's head a clear-headed rationality and approach to immigration questions. Once an immigration decision has been made, it is immensely difficult to reverse it—and the ramifications of a decision can extend well into the future, which has occurred in the case of the Chinese students. There is no doubt that that decision has distorted the immigration program, and it continues to so do.

But, in speaking to the amendment moved by the honourable member for Dundas, I say that the attitude that the Minister has displayed goes some way towards meeting the real problems that have surfaced in this immigration debate but it does not go far enough or quickly enough. He says that he is always getting advice from people. I know that as Minister for Immigration one thing one never lacks is advice; one gets it from everywhere. But I urge him to look carefully at the advice that has been proffered, with the very best will in the world, by the Opposition. If he accepted that advice, I believe we would get this thing under control. It certainly has been out of control until the present time.

         Indeed, the long term interests of Australia must surely lie with a sustained and substantial immigration program, not with panicking in the face of some recessionary pressures and slashing immigration for opportunistic reasons, which is the position which has been advocated by the Opposition. It is not only that, of course, because the long term interests of Australia include, and have always included, achieving an immigration program which is supported by the Australian people.

         An immigration program that is supported by the Australian people is a program that is seen to be fair and just by the Australian people. The honourable member for Dundas is not interested in such a program. In recent times he has been particularly angry with me for suggesting that his calls for the introduction of English language requirements into the concessional family category are in fact discriminatory. I repeat in this House that to introduce an English language test into a family reunion program is essentially to introduce a discriminatory criterion with respect to some families vis-a-vis others.

         The honourable member for Dundas issued a press statement a little while ago saying that I have a fixation with the family reunion program and cannot get away from it. The reality is that the family reunion program, sociologically, my dear colleague, has proved to be the most successful aspect of our immigration program. I challenge the honourable member to give any information to the contrary. The family reunion program involves people bringing their relatives here. When they bring them here they work very hard to put together assistance for them. They help them find jobs, they help them to look after their children, they help them to learn English, and they help them to fit into the community. That is an undisputed fact about our settlement patterns in Australia that has been commented on for many years by people who have studied this matter.

         Australia has had one of the most successful immigration programs in the world. The key aspect of it has been the family reunion program. So I make no apologies for wanting the retention of the family reunion program. The fact that I want to keep a balance between the independent immigration program and the family reunion program is considered by the honourable member for Dundas to be a fixation which is against the long term interests of Australia. What rubbish! If there is anything that is against the long term interests of Australia, it is the recent opportunistic behaviour of the honourable member for Dundas and the Leader of the Opposition in attacking the family reunion program and suggesting that, somehow, migrants who come under the family reunion program are far inferior to those who come under the independent program. That is absurd, and it is not borne out by the facts.

         The reality is that the family reunion program has brought to this country people who have made massive contributions, including in the economic area. Let me take one of the suggested criteria. Some of the most distinguished Australians who migrated to this country—some of the biggest achievers in this country's history—could not speak English when they arrived. Under the proposal of the honourable member for Dundas we would introduce that criterion into the family reunion program and such persons would never be able to come here, irrespective of the fact that they already have to meet under the family reunion program educational criteria, job skills criteria and age criteria. In other words, they have to be young, educated, dynamic people, but we say, `We are sorry, but because you don't speak English you can't come under the family reunion program'.

         The honourable member for Dundas would have us believe that one could actually introduce such a system and claim it was not discriminatory. The reality is that, after the 1987 report of the FitzGerald Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies, this Government accepted a compromise, on which we based our immigration program. The compromise was very clear. It said that the family reunion program would not have an English language requirement, but we accepted that the independent category would have an English language requirement. There was a balance reached between those who wanted an English language requirement for all immigrants and those who wanted it for none. We reached a compromise, a balance.

         We said that, in the independent category, because these people were coming for specific jobs in specific areas in the Australian economy, it was fair enough to bring in the English language requirement. But it was made perfectly clear at that time that the concessional family category would not have an English language requirement. For the honourable member for Dundas to be putting forward this claim is to introduce a discriminatory criterion. I must say that I reject that approach, and I also reject his claims about the long term impact on the current balance. The current balance has worked well for Australia and it should continue.

         The Opposition in recent times has seemed to grab onto whatever it can find in order to appear different from the Government, so it has picked on this idea of the English language requirement. It has decided to attack the family reunion component. Unfortunately the people who are affected do not have sufficient voice in the House of Representatives, in the Senate and in the whole Australian establishment. But they are the people whose families will be seriously affected because they will not be able to reunite with their relatives. It is fine for us who have all our families here to say to other people, `We are going to set down these criteria, and it is too bad if you cannot reunite with your families'. I personally think that to proceed with such an approach would end up creating very severe social tensions in this country. It would not be in Australia's best long term interests.

         I return for a moment to the economic argument. One of the interesting things about the economic argument that ought to be put on the record is this: when the Minister went around the various groups discussing immigration, a number of the key business groups—the Housing Industry Association, for example—pointed out to him the importance of continuing with a reasonable level of immigration in this country for economic reasons. It is interesting that those groups, with the exception of the Housing Industry Association, have not decided to say very much about it publicly. They have talked to the Minister about it, they have talked to other people and other members of parliament about it, including myself, but those business groups have not been prepared to come out and say what they have said privately about the economics of immigration. They have not been prepared to do so. One wonders whether that is because the Leader of the Opposition has taken such a strong anti-immigration stand and they do not want to embarrass him. If we are to have an honest debate about the economics of immigration in this country, two things become perfectly clear. Firstly, there is absolutely no evidence—none whatever—that any respectable academic is prepared to put up that immigration contributes to unemployment. On the contrary, the evidence is either that the effect is neutral or that it can contribute in a positive way to creating employment.

         Yet the myth persists throughout the whole of this community that immigration is a negative for employment. It is a myth which continues to be peddled as a result of the sorts of statements that have been made by the honourable member for Dundas and by the Leader of the Opposition. Frankly, they ought to be ashamed of themselves, because on their own economic theory, the economic theory of the Murphy model which they used in Fightback, immigration is a positive for the economy. They have ignored all that. They have decided to use one model for Fightback, but they have ignored the immigration aspect and what the Murphy model says about immigration. Instead, they have peddled to the popular myth. When leadership on this question was required in this country the Opposition peddled the popular myth that immigration was a negative for the economy. That argument has probably been lost; as a result, there will probably be a reduction in immigration.

I have made it clear to the Minister that I support those provisions in the following context: it is very important for us to send a message overseas that we will not tolerate people simply arriving here on the basis of trying to jump the refugee queues. That message is fair enough; I approve of that.

         The Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations has taken evidence in relation to what happened to the Cambodian people in the first two or three boat groups. I have said this in another place; I repeat it here: I am absolutely appalled that these people had to wait for such a long time before their applications even went in. I know that the majority of the fault lay with the people who were advising the would-be refugees. Some of those lawyers and other people were delaying the process in the hope that the longer the refugees stayed in detention the better would be their chances of staying in Australia. That was incorrect.

We, as a society, could have said, `Look, these people are in detention for this period; how about we do something?'. And we did do something. The Minister tried to do something shortly after taking office. The lawyers then went to court and delayed the process even further. There was further delay for these refugees when the Minister was trying to process the matter quickly. Those people who are critical of the actions of the Minister are mistaken. If they look at the totality of the Minister's actions, they will see that he tried to get this processing done as quickly as possible, but the delays that kept occurring in the courts have contributed to the suffering by these people. It is important that we take that on board. We must make sure that that does not happen again.

         To prevent that happening again, the Committee recommended a change to the regulations to ensure that persons arriving illegally now must get their forms in within 28 days. That is very important. We do not want a repeat of what happened with those three Cambodian boat groups. We want the applications by these people to go in quickly and have them looked at. They will have a fair go during examination by departmental officials and later if they want to go to the Refugee Status Review Council.

I want to allude to one point that the honourable member for Calwell made. It is unfortunate that this has taken so long. I think the point that I made on a television program about how I had been conned by people was missed by a member of the Opposition who used it in an earlier debate. My motive for being scrupulously fair was to ensure that the Cambodians, the PRCs and the few Vietnamese who happen to be in custody at this point got the fairest possible opportunity to present their case.

         Legal procedures prevent me from elaborating on what, in fact, occurred. But let there be no mistake—I have the interests of this nation in mind. I go back to an earlier debate today where I said, `Where I have the ability and control over matters that I am concerned with, I will be scrupulously fair and firm'. The problem is that I have not always had that ability or control over certain things. Where I have control I will be fair, but firm, in the interests of the nation and in the interests of the applicant.

         In the case of the Cambodians, I repeat again in this chamber that I do not accept fault in terms of the slowness of this processing by the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, the officers or necessarily by me—but I am secondary. I am fed up with people having a go at the Department and the officers that work tirelessly in extraordinarily difficult situations, particularly regarding these boat people, where they cannot defend themselves, they cannot come in here or they cannot go to the media because of some legal constraint or some threat of legal action by some slick lawyer. It is a very difficult situation.

         So I make the plea to the community that we are trying to process these people quickly, and we will. But the process is going to be adhered to. Let everybody understand—lawyer, churchman, citizen and applicant—that there will be no deviating by anybody from the process. This is the first time that I have had the chance in here to say that. All the pressure, all the deceit and all the manipulation is not going to make me shift one centimetre in terms of the process.

         I give two examples. First, a woman was shown on television stumbling out of a car. She was encouraged to run to the fence to embrace her son through the wire. But the departmental officers had made arrangements to have the gate open 50 yards down the road so that the car could drive in and she could embrace her son in a proper way. But that was not good television; that was not good copy. People not associated with the Department at Port Hedland were appalled at the behaviour of the TV crew trying to entice this unfortunate woman faced with this dilemma to be used for a cheap shot. Secondly, a bishop goes on television and alleges that the Department and I are engaged in some sort of compulsory abortion process, and then he carefully backs away. That is another outrageous lie—bishop or no bishop. That was never going to happen.

         These are the things that will come out, but there will be no shifting or moving away. I will defend my officers vigorously because I have worked closely with them. Everybody had better be on notice. We are acting in the best interests of this nation and the applicants. I expect support for that. But I will not be pressured by anybody where I am in control of it. What others do is another matter, and I can be hung for that too—and I have been in both portfolios, I suspect. But in this situation where we are in control of it, we are going to end up with the best process in the world.

         The press can have its cheap shots and honourable members can have their cheap shots, but few of them I suspect have any real understanding of how complex and difficult this whole thing is. The fact that we are dealing with people's lives does not make the job very easy. We are subject to all the experts, all the advice and, as I say, all the manipulation. But we are not shifting, and both sides of the House should make no mistake about it. I will leave the job before I engage in a manipulation or sleight of hand of this process. So the House had better be on notice about that. It is not going to be done. I have the first opportunity perhaps to defend myself and my officers from the constant barrage of misinformation and cheap shots that have been portrayed in the media over a period of time. It is not going to be tolerated any more.

         —The Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1992 and related legislation introduces a new system of compulsory superannuation into Australia. It is precisely because of the word `compulsion' that the Opposition's amendment calls on the House to withdraw this legislation, which would introduce a compulsory superannuation scheme for Australians. Following the revelations contained in recent Treasury evidence to the Senate inquiry into superannuation, it is clear that there are no economic, financial or social justifications for the Government's proposals which, if implemented, would cause even higher unemployment, reduce real wages, add to inflation and do nothing to provide genuine retirement income for the majority of Australians.

         The Bills are designed to implement the Government's decision announced in the 1991-92 Budget to impose a non-tax deductible levy on employers who fail to provide superannuation support at a minimum percentage level of employee's earnings, which would automatically and progressively increase over time to reach at least 9 per cent by the year 2000.

         The proposal in this new regime ultimately will complement, but not replace, award superannuation. In fact, it will introduce a complex four-tiered process. We have award superannuation; employer-funded superannuation schemes; personal schemes, such as 23FC; and, finally, we have the superannuation guarantee scheme, which is also built into this legislation. Is it any wonder that we therefore tell the Government that it is introducing at this stage yet another level of massive complexity and cost at the very time the Australian employers, as well as employees, do not need additional restrictions on the capacity to employ?

         As far as the Opposition is concerned, this is not a bona fide retirement incomes proposal. It is, in effect, an attempt to use retirement income to solve what is nothing more nor less than an industrial relations problem relating to the ACTU and the implementation of the accord.

         Award superannuation was introduced in 1986 when the Industrial Relations Commission agreed to sanction consent awards requiring the payment of 3 per cent of wages into specified funds. In most cases, these were nominated union-sponsored industry funds agreed upon by unions and employer representatives. Trustees were made up of representatives of both of these groups, but no trustees represented the interests of the employees themselves, nor were they ever appointed or elected by those employees.

         Effectively, therefore, this new procedure was introduced in 1986 without any consultation with the Australian work force. The decision applied only to Federal awards so that employees with no award coverage, or those that were covered by State awards, were not covered by the decision. Despite the fact that there had been a relatively high level of non-compliance—in fact, according to Senator Cook, it is currently running at the rate of some $700m a year—in the run-up to the 1990 election, the Government announced that it would support an ACTU application for a second round of 3 per cent award superannuation.

         Contrary to expectations, in its April 1991 national wage case judgment, the IRC refused to approve the application and, instead, recommended that the Government should convene a national conference on superannuation and, more generally, on retirement incomes policy. Not unreasonably, the business community of Australia and the Opposition welcomed that recommendation. Regrettably, the Government refused to debate the issues in public and ultimately decided to reject the recommendation.

         Since then, we have had the establishment of a Senate inquiry, which has already uncovered considerable, very interesting information. This underlines precisely the purpose of the Opposition, which is to condemn and oppose this legislation. The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation was established by the coalition and the Australian Democrats to put pressure on the Government to convene a national conference. As I have said, at least to date, that has been to no avail. Nevertheless, the Government simply announced its support for a compulsory scheme to give the ACTU, effectively, by the back door what the Industrial Relations Commission had refused to give it by the front door.

         As the Business Council of Australia has pointed out, employers are being compelled to fund a system which has more to do with holding the accord together than developing a genuine retirement incomes policy for Australia. In social policy terms, the Opposition is of the view that a genuine and worthwhile retirement incomes policy, in the context of a greying Australia, is undoubtedly one of the most important areas of social policy to which this Government should address itself far more than it has.

         What I found particularly interesting was the suggestion that the Government may be looking at a proposal to introduce what it calls superannuation retirement accounts. In our 1986 policy we announced that the Opposition parties would have retirement savings accounts. If they emerge, at least something will have been achieved. One of the fundamental failures of the Government policy is that it has been grossly unfair to women, and particularly to part time workers, the vast majority of whom are women.

         The Treasurer, in his second reading speech on this legislation, emphasised that the very fundamental purpose of the Bill was to overcome two major problems: firstly, the need to boost national savings; and, secondly, the need to arrest the rising costs of age pensions. The Senate evidence, which has come from the Treasury, makes it quite clear that there is no substance in either of the arguments which have so far come forward in that place.

         The main provisions of the legislation to be introduced on 1 July 1991, in respect of the 1992-93 financial year, will affect employers with annual payrolls of more than half a million dollars. They will be required to contribute 5 per cent of each employee's earnings, up to a maximum level of $80,000, to any complying fund. That represents a contribution cap of some $4,000 a year per employee. The point should be emphasised that we are far more generous than the Government in this area, because we have a contribution cap of $6,000 per employee. In addition, we will provide a further $6,000 to support, in superannuation terms, wives and spouses of employees—or employers, for that matter. In addition, we are providing a 25 per cent tax rebate on all contributions up to that limit. Overall, the evidence suggests that the changes the Government is ultimately likely to introduce will be very similar to the proposals we have put forward.

         For employers with payrolls of less than half a million dollars, the prescribed starting rate will be 3 per cent. This rate will rise progressively so that it reaches 9 per cent by the year 2000, and it will be fully employer funded. No contribution from employees is taken account of in these proposals. In addition, a further 3 per cent employee contribution could be considered, taking the prescribed rate to 12 per cent by the year 2000. That has to be negotiated on a basis which will take account of wage trade-offs over that time. Therefore, if the Government policy is applied, the real prospect facing hundreds of thousands of Australian middle- to low-income workers is that they will have very little, if any, increase in wages over that time.

         Employers who fail to pay the minimum contribution will be required to pay a non-deductible levy to the Taxation Office. So this superannuation guarantee scheme, which I referred to earlier as the mechanism the Government intends to use, is bizarre. Whereas in all other aspects of this proposal employees have no right of choice whatsoever, we are told that under the superannuation guarantee scheme employees will have some degree of choice in relation to the funding of their superannuation contributions, taken on a compulsory basis from their employers. Existing contributions will be able to be offset against the above-mentioned contributions and the amount of the levy will be distributed by the Taxation Office to a superannuation fund for the employees to whom it relates.

         Proposals of this nature quite obviously have major macro-economic impacts, especially on employers' capacity to pay. While Australia still suffers from the deepest economic recession in 60 years, with unemployment at over 10 per cent and at least one million Australians out of work—and there are all sorts of estimates as to the level of underemployment; it could well be half a million—the last thing businesses need is policies which will undermine further their capacity to expand their enterprises and increase employment opportunities.

This regime will add an extra $3 billion to $4 billion a year to labour costs, irrespective of the state of the international or the domestic economy, let alone the plight of individual employers and those employees who will be unemployed because of these proposals.

        How absolutely ridiculous it is to suggest that small businesses in particular—which will be the major losers under these proposals—are now to be forced to have a further impost on their wages bills, which will make them that much less economic and less able to survive in a very difficult market environment. The impact on small business, where the great bulk of the burden will undoubtedly fall, will therefore be even more severe. The VACC estimates that, for an average award employee, total on-costs will rise from 31.5 per cent to 37 per cent of labour costs, and even more for staff not covered by awards. Like the training guarantee levy, the SGL is a de facto payroll or employment tax, imposed regardless of profitability. But, unlike the TGL, it offers no prospects of productivity improvements.

         Here, once again, the Opposition parties stand in direct contrast to the approach being taken by the Government. We support a voluntary superannuation scheme. We support the removal of all taxes such as payroll taxes. We support employment. We support getting people off the unemployment lists and giving them back the self-respect which employment gives when people can make a contribution to themselves, their families and the nation. That is why we find this legislation so absolutely abhorrent. Against all the evidence from the Treasury, from the Department of Finance, from the private sector, from the superannuation industry itself and from all the major employer organisations, the words are crystal clear: Australia does not need, and cannot afford, these proposals at this time.

         As I said initially, one of the other purposes of this legislation, according to the Treasurer, is to increase Australian domestic savings. Undoubtedly, there is an urgent need to boost national savings in this country. Household savings have more than halved from a peak of about 15 per cent of disposable income in the mid-1970s to just over 6 per cent in 1990-91. But it does not follow that forcing workers to go without wage increases will help the cause. Overseas experience has shown quite conclusively that, unless there is rising output and productivity, compulsory savings in one form will simply lead to a run-down in savings elsewhere in the economy.

         The cost of the age pension, which is the second objective of the Government in this legislation, is obviously a matter of considerable long term concern to us all.

        </tab>

        there will be over four million in the year 2021. This translates into a drop in the ratio of Australians of working age to those over 65 from 5:1 to 3:1.

         The double-dipping gap has encouraged people to retire early—to take their entitlements and then qualify for the age pension in due course. What is the outcome of this? Some 77 per cent of people of age pension age are currently receiving a pension at a cost to the Australian taxpayer of more than $12 billion a year. The Government and the ACTU are obviously determined not to close the double-dipping gap. The age pension bill must therefore certainly rise steeply in the years ahead.

The fundamental questions are: what is the hidden agenda of this Labor Party; what are the changes it intends to introduce in the future; and how is it therefore going to establish the very basis of an effective retirement income system? Such a system must surely be based upon two principles: firstly, the capacity of employers to pay; and, secondly, the capacity of individuals to take at least the minimum steps necessary to safeguard themselves in retirement. Regrettably, the Government has failed on both counts.

         Let us regard again the question of who pays. Unlike every other compulsory system in the world, the superannuation guarantee levy legislation puts the burden entirely on employers, many of whom will be expected to find 12 per cent within eight years. The Government's timetable ostensibly requires employers to pay 9 per cent by the year 2000, but it is clear that they will be expected to pay the last 3 per cent as well. The Government has said only that it will give consideration to using employee contributions and tax cuts. But if employees believe—as they have been encouraged to do by some trade unions and certainly by the Government's approach—that the overall responsibility for retirement income rests absolutely with employers, of course they will take the easy option. But the question which has to be addressed is: is that the right direction for Australia?  We are firmly of the view that the answer must be no.

         The employer-pays approach will invariably encourage many employees to take the view that superannuation is no longer their responsibility, therefore ensuring the lowest common denominator. The saddest fact of all is that low income Australians and many middle income Australians under the proposed system, may find themselves in the position where they will still qualify for at least part pensions. The principle which the Minister enunciated at the beginning of his remarks about reducing the cost of pensions will be thwarted by the very failure of this legislation to address effectively that fundamental principle. If we want people employed, we must encourage them to contribute to their retirement income. By all means we should continue tax deductions for their contributions, and for employers as well. But it is absurd to suggest that a universal superannuation scheme, especially a compulsory scheme of this nature, will effectively cover all Australians.

         May I make some other observations about the legislation. There is no evidence to indicate that it will in any way arrest the rising costs of age pensions, which, as I said, are currently $12 billion a year. The Government has no idea of the cost to revenue of rising tax concessions as a result of the legislation, nor does it dispute that low income earners, particularly part timers and casuals, will get virtually nothing from the new regime.

There is very little evidence to suggest that the legislation will result in significant increases in national savings. There is no financial justification for not closing the double dipping gap by raising the preservation age. These concessions go to the heart of the case and make it clear that this legislation is not a retirement income policy;  rather, it is an ACTU industrial relations solution to the problems of non-compliance under existing award superannuation arrangements.

         —I strongly support this Superannuation Guarantee Charge Bill and related Bills. It imposes a tax on employers who fail to pay designated levels of superannuation support to their employees. The tax will not, of course, be applied if an employer's contributions are paid to the minimum level of an employee's earnings base. The maximum level of the earnings base is $80,000 per annum, indexed annually. The minimum levels of employer contributions are, as set out in the Bill, for employers with a payroll of $500,000 or less, 3 per cent for 1992-93 and 1993-94, rising to 7 per cent by 1997-98 and to 9 per cent by the year 2000. Employers with a payroll of more than half a million dollars will be required to pay 5 per cent in the next two years, 6 per cent in the ensuing two years, rising to 7 per cent in 1996-97, at which point the smaller employers' contribution will have caught up with that of the larger employers and will progress in tandem to 9 per cent by the year 2000. It will be seen that small businesses—those with a payroll of less than half a million dollars—will, as I just said, from 1997-98 basically be paying the same level as the larger employers.

         The first stage of the Government's move towards increased superannuation cover for all employees was made in the 1986 national wage case when the decision was that 3 per cent of salary should be paid by employers in superannuation to cover all workers under Federal awards. In 1991 the Industrial Relations Commission, I think mistakenly, refused to extend that 3 per cent to 6 per cent. In the 1991-92 Budget, the Government announced legislation to extend the coverage.

         The reasons for this decision last year are very easy to see. Firstly, it is necessary to ensure compliance with the original IRC decision, that is, the 1986 award based superannuation decision. Secondly, it is to extend coverage to increase employer support over an extended period. Thirdly, it is meant to reduce the number of future total dependants on social security pensions, to improve living standards for retirees and to reduce outlays from the Budget in future years. Fourthly, it is expected to increase national domestic savings, involving less reliance on foreign savings and overseas borrowings in future.

         Since 1988 superannuation coverage of workers in this country has risen from just over 42 per cent to just over 72 per cent;  however, by July 1991—five years after the 1986 decision—there was a 30 per cent non-compliance rate with that decision by employers, mainly those with fewer than 100 employees. In addition, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission last year in its national wage case decision refused the application of the Government and the ACTU for a staged 3 per cent increase to award superannuation. In other words, some employers had failed their employees, and the Industrial Relations Commission had failed the nation in its decision inasmuch as its decision did not increase award superannuation by 3 per cent staged over a number of years.

         It became necessary to legislate to ensure full coverage and increased contributions by employers to national superannuation in this country.

         —Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner, I was saying that the number of aged persons over 65 years was increasing and the ratio of working age people to those of retiring age was decreasing, obviously, at the same time. In 1991 the percentage of the population aged 65 years and over was 11.4 per cent or 1.97 million. In the year 2031 that same category is projected to increase to 5 million or 20 per cent of the population. The ratio of those working to those retired in June 1991 was 5.5:1; in June 2031 it will be only 3:1. These simple figures illustrate the danger of relying on pay as you go funding for pensions as distinct from invested superannuation.

         All else being equal, the outlays on age pensions will multiply by a factor of 2:2.5 if nothing is done to correct this situation in the meantime. In 1991-92 the outlays on age pensions was $9.7 billion; in the year 2031 I expect that Budget outlays to fund age pensions could increase from $9.7 billion to $14.6 billion.

         The question is: what would be the extent of savings to budget outlays if we implement the legislation under discussion? I think it is deplorable that no Treasury estimate exists. Treasury has inflicted a great disservice to this Government in not making these projections sooner. Nevertheless, commonsense dictates that there will be savings. Given similar income and assets tests in real terms, only 30 to 40 per cent reduced eligibility would be required for age pensions to effect a saving of between $4.4 billion and $6.6 billion in 1991-92 dollars.

         We also need to increase domestic savings. Private sector savings, unfortunately, are down from 4.1 per cent of GDP in 1982-83 to 3.3 per cent of GDP in 1990-91. A current snapshot of the economy shows a mixed picture. On the positive side interest rates are falling and bank bills are now down to 6.6 per cent and, hopefully, they will be down even further tomorrow. Inflation was zero in the March quarter, housing approvals were up 5 per cent and external deficits are trending down.

         On the negative side, GDP was only 0.3 per cent growth in the December quarter; investment will be minus 6.5 per cent for 1991-92; unemployment, of course, is at 10.5 per cent—up to 20 per cent in some electorates like mine; and, as I just said, savings are down as a percentage of GDP. The conclusion that one draws is this: One Nation forecasts will be met regarding low inflation and external account projections through the 1990s, but I am very doubtful about us meeting the 4 per cent plus GDP and job growth projections. But there will be a recovery, even if it is only a modest one, and with that recovery will come increases in demand. Australia will require increased savings to fund increased investment, so there will be less reliance upon foreign savings and overseas borrowings in future. We would then avoid the higher interest rates which come with the need to attract foreign capital in ever increasing amounts. In other words, with increased savings, we would have lower real interest rates and probably a lower dollar, which will benefit exports and import replacement industries.

         The question is: what will be the extent of these savings if we implement universal superannuation? Again, I deeply regret the absence of Treasury projections, but still we can make some commonsense general assessments. Firstly, we need to understand that the employer contributions are a substitute for wage increases that would otherwise have been achieved. Secondly, it is reasonable to assume that future wage increases probably will not exceed CPI increases. If the consumer price index projections are low in the 1990s, as I believe they will be—in a 2.5 to 3.5 per cent range—and the mean increase to the superannuation contributions effected by this legislation is about 7.5 per cent over that time, then I expect the extent to which wage increases are substituted by contributions to superannuation will be about 33 per cent of the total wage increases that would otherwise have occurred.

         The question is: would this have been saved if it had been taken in wages? The answer is, `Of course not', and I say that to the Opposition. We have only to look at the decline in the general percentage of savings to GDP in the private sector, which I just mentioned, to understand that. The best guesstimate of the increase in savings could come from comparing the current growth in accumulating superannuation investment portfolios with the estimates of growth if we legislate general superannuation coverage.

         At the moment the funds are increasing by about $5 billion in their investment portfolio per quarter. At that rate they would reach about $300 billion, if nothing was done, by about the year 2000 AD. But we expect that if something is done, such as this legislation, investment by the funds would increase to between $450 billion and $600 billion. So there is every chance that, as a result of what we are doing, accumulated investment by the funds will increase by between $150 billion to $300 billion by the year 2000 AD as a result of the move to universal compulsory superannuation through the private sector. This is a very important step forward.

         Given that there is an element of compulsion in all of this—and certainly there is—and an element of wage substitution, the Government must impose more stringent prudential supervision than exists at present and it must consider again the question of investment controls. Currently the Government and the industry oppose investment controls. I believe they should think again. Surely Australians will expect a maximum effort from the funds to stimulate domestic growth; that is, jobs for the workers who invest in the funds, their children and their grandchildren.

         In the 18 months to December 1991 overseas assets invested by superannuation funds rose from 11.7 per cent to 14.5 per cent; that is, to $21.3 billion as it stands now. There should be a future portfolio limit of 20 per cent on funds, invested outside Australia by superannuation funds. This could be achieved via the tax system. I say that without fear of contradiction by the Australian workers. A further issue is this: the majority of investments of the major funds—and most of the minor ones—are in either property, bonds or blue chip shares to the detriment of new growth industries. Superannuation funds and approved development funds outside life assurance offices investing directly now have 18 per cent of their portfolio in land and buildings as at December 1991.

         —I wish we could accommodate the previous speaker, the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West), and come to terms with the legislation the Government has placed before the Parliament but, unfortunately, in his and earlier remarks from that side there have not been any compelling reasons for doing that. The superannuation guarantee levy was announced in the 1991-92 Budget and is intended to come into effect from 1 July of this year. The levy provided for in these Bills aims to reinforce the existing award superannuation arrangements by extending superannuation coverage to as much of the work force as possible, which has, of course, been the Government's stated objective for some time.

         Under the superannuation guarantee scheme, the Taxation Office will collect revenue from employers who do not provide a minimum level of superannuation coverage for their employees. These revenue collections will then be redistributed to complying superannuation schemes for the benefit of those employees for whom the Government deems inadequate superannuation support has been provided. These distributions will have the administrative costs of running the superannuation guarantee levy deducted from them. So super funds will not fully benefit from the extent of the Australian Taxation Office's collections on behalf of employees. Administrative costs are expected to be in the vicinity of $130 per person, and that should not be overlooked. It should also be noted that many part time and casual employees on whose behalf these funds are collected will never derive any benefit from these distributions.

         Perhaps the most odious feature of the superannuation guarantee levy is that it will apply to all employers regardless of their individual capacity to pay. The prescribed minimum level of employer superannuation support to apply from 1 July 1992 will be 5 per cent of earnings for employees of employers which have annual payrolls larger than $500,000 and 3 per cent of earnings for all other employees. The Government will eventually increase the prescribed minimum level of superannuation support to 9 per cent for all employees by the year 2000, with the Government leaving open to itself the option of increasing that level to 12 per cent of earnings within this timeframe.

         By all accounts, the superannuation guarantee levy will have a disastrous impact on business in Australia. This levy will need to be paid out of companies' profits or retained earnings or on top of wages. They are the only three sources of the levy. This will result in a reduction in the capacity of Australian businesses to invest for future growth, or it will reduce the immediate standard of living of those employees who are meant to be the beneficiaries of this scheme.

When the proposed superannuation guarantee levy is run through Access Economics' Murphy model it shows that the levy will increase the number of unemployed by between 45,000 and 70,000, depending on which assumptions are used. The model also shows that inflation can be expected to rise by over 2 per cent as a direct result of the levy.

         The superannuation guarantee levy reflects the failure of the Government's retirement incomes policy over its nine long years in office. It is designed to redress the massive non-compliance on the part of employers with the terms of award superannuation and the failure of the Government to make superannuation an attractive option for employees without access to award based superannuation. It also reflects the refusal of the Industrial Relations Commission to endorse the second-round 3 per cent increase in award superannuation as sought by the Government.

         The IRC has refused further increases in award superannuation without the Government taking further steps to clarify the role of award superannuation and in its approach to wages and retirement incomes policy. The IRC recognises that the Government is deficient in those areas. The Government has for some time now expressed its preference for superannuation to act as Australia's main savings vehicle and is the foundation of its retirement incomes policy. It has therefore sought to extend the scope and level of superannuation coverage for the Australian work force. Having failed to secure these objectives through award superannuation and through generous tax concessions for superannuation fund contributors, the Government is now seeking to coerce employees and employers into meeting the Government's preferred level of superannuation coverage.

         In seeking to extend the coverage of superannuation to include most of the work force, however, the Government has shown a complete disregard for the quality of that coverage. In particular, it seems that the level of superannuation support for employees to be provided under the superannuation guarantee levy will be inadequate to meet either their retirement needs or to reduce Australia's age pension bill in the short to medium term. Even if the superannuation guarantee levy reaches the upper range of 12 per cent of earnings that the Government has flagged as a possibility by the year 2000, it is unlikely that many workers would be completely disqualified from receipt of the age pension without having made substantial additional contributions of their own to their superannuation fund.

         Estimates of the level of contribution needed to sustain a pension-free retirement vary considerably, as we all know, but it is clear that the superannuation guarantee levy is unlikely to make a significant dent in Australia's age pension bill in the years to come. It is generally considered necessary for a worker to put away 12 per cent of his or her income over 35 to 40 years in order to be able to retire on a benefit equal to 50 per cent of average weekly earnings. So it will be at least 50 years before the superannuation levy has a major impact on the age pension bill in this country.

         It was recently revealed in hearings before the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation that neither the Treasury nor the Tax Office had made any attempt to calculate whether the superannuation guarantee levy would reduce the Commonwealth's pension bill or increase national savings in the next century. This is in sharp contrast, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would know only too well, to the detailed analysis the Treasury has performed on the impact of the Opposition's superannuation proposals in the Fightback package and up to the year 1996. At the present time it seems that the Treasury is more interested in modelling coalition policy than in further developing Government policy.

         Government superannuation policy on the Australian economy. But this has not stopped the Government proceeding with this lamentable set of Bills. It is becoming increasingly clear that the Government's attempts to extend the coverage of superannuation as widely as possible are having perverse effects on Australia's national savings effort. The proportion of national savings held by life offices has increased dramatically in recent years, but only at the expense of other savings vehicles. In fact, the household savings ratio has fallen considerably in recent years to around about 4 per cent, and it is continuing to fall.

         Clearly, many people are using superannuation as a substitute for, rather than a complement to, their personal savings for retirement. Indeed, why should people provide for their own retirement when they are under the deliberately imparted impression that the Government has done this for them through award superannuation and the superannuation levy? It promises the kind of Medicare levy mentality whereby many in this country still think that that impost—the Medicare levy—covers all health costs. That is what the Government is repeating here again; it will create a mind set which will cost this country dearly.

         The Government can mandate minimum levels of employer superannuation support for employees until it is blue in the face, but it will not succeed in increasing the overall level of savings in this country, which is widely recognised as one of our major economic problems. The massive flow of funds into superannuation may also have the effect of reducing incentives to fund managers to maximise returns on contributors' funds. With award based superannuation and now the superannuation guarantee levy ensuring that superannuation fund managers are in receipt of a guaranteed flow of funds to manage, there will be less competition from other savings vehicles to keep superannuation fund managers on their toes. In other words, there will be an absence of normal competition.

         Another factor motivating the Government in its imposition of this levy is that the taxation regime and the administration arrangements that the Government has established for superannuation have failed to provide incentives to low income earners and many others in the work force to take out superannuation. In fact, they contain many positive disincentives. The tax concessions that the Government has made available for superannuation, which cost the revenue some $3.35 billion in 1989-90, have acted as a tax shelter for the well-off, at the cost to revenue that may very well be greater than the prospective cost of providing the age pension to beneficiaries under these arrangements; it might very well exceed that.

         Under the current taxation arrangements for superannuation a person paying the top marginal personal income tax rate obtains a tax break of 33.25c in the dollar from superannuation tax concessions. By contrast, a person on the lowest marginal tax rate gets a tax break of only 5c in the dollar or 6.25c if the Medicare levy is payable. Yet it is these people whom we most want to encourage to provide for their retirement. Many high income earners have been able to claim individual tax deductions for superannuation contributions in excess of $100,000 per annum, resulting in tax benefits in excess of $33,000 a year for those people.

         The inequities generated by the current arrangements for superannuation are not just the result of the skewed nature of the tax benefits that they confer. The enormous complexity of current superannuation taxation and administrative arrangements also discriminates heavily against low income earners. This was something that was recently conceded by Treasury officials in evidence given before the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. Treasury officials then noted that the current complexity in the administration and taxation of superannuation serves to reduce the benefits payable to contributors, acting again as a deterrent for low income earners to take out superannuation.

         When this Government first assumed office, there was only one tax on superannuation; today there are six such taxes. This Government has increased taxation on superannuation savings by 1,000 per cent. These imposts include a 15 per cent tax on employer contributions, a 15 per cent tax on the income of funds, a 16.25 per cent tax on lump sums, a 21.25 per cent tax on lump sums for people under 55, the pre-1983 tax arrangements and the application of capital gains tax on superannuation fund assets.

        Other people have come forward with comments but I will not go into that tonight. Rather than any concrete proposals for ensuring that all Australians, regardless of their level of income, are covered by some form of superannuation support, the Opposition continues to mouth the same free market slogans about allowing greater choice for individual employers. In the place of the ordered and structured system of award based superannuation, the Opposition proposes a confused system of individual and employer funded superannuation schemes.

         The undermining of the great advances that have been made in the area of superannuation is all in the name of not forcing Australians to save for their retirement. Well, what a negative thing that would be. Rather than being an incentive, the tax changes proposed by those opposite in the area of superannuation would provide a huge disincentive to savings. In the cause of some vague free market ideology, the Liberal Party is prepared to see a reduction in the important role played in recent years by superannuation in increasing the national savings pool.

This has not only become the Government's hallmark in the area of retirement incomes; it has also stood it apart clearly from those members opposite. Its goal has been to strike the correct balance between income adequacy for those in need and incentives for all Australians to maximise their retirement incomes. This legislation which will put in place the superannuation guarantee levy will be a further important step in encouraging the growth of superannuation as a form of savings in this country.

         —The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) is starting to believe the Government's propaganda in relation to superannuation. Firstly, I would make the point that he places great emphasis on the employer making the contribution. As we all know, the Government's proposition will not provide real superannuation for retirement. He raises the point of those higher income earners who receive greater tax concessions. The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) addressed that problem and we address it in Fightback. The Government's proposals do not address that issue. The honourable member for Oxley skated around that issue without any positive alternative. The Superannuation Guarantee Charge Bill and the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill seek to impose an extra charge on employers—the very point that the honourable member for Oxley does not fully understand—who fail to meet the new standards of superannuation support that the Government has set out.

         I would like to begin in a different way to other speakers and have a look at the practice in other overseas nations. Most governments regard retirement incomes as a very important area, because the policies that guide individuals through their working lives impact so heavily on government expenditure when members of the community reach their early sixties. A number of the more prosperous, or in some cases fast growing nations, are sometimes held up as models for Australia. These countries often ensure that there is a clear link between the level of superannuation contributions made by the employee and the amount the employer puts in—the very point that the honourable member for Oxley fails to understand.

         Switzerland makes both employers and employees contribute 4.8 per cent of total earnings to a pension fund. Austria has a contribution level of 12.25 per cent for employers and 10.25 per cent for employees, noting that both parties are contributing. The economic powerhouse of Japan is a country where social pension contributions are shared equally between employers and employees. In South Korea, which has been recording a GDP growth rate in excess of Australia, the present contributions are 1.5 per cent for the employer and employee. The Malaysian economy is expected to grow at an average rate of 7 per cent per annum until the turn of the century. In that nation employees pay 9 per cent and employers pay 11 per cent, maintaining the nexus between those two groups. Australia now proposes to go against what these other economically successful nations practise. Even more importantly, these Bills are not in the individual economic interest of Australia, especially with the nation being in its worst recession in 60 years—a recession that we had to have, as is so well known by members of this House.

         I have many concerns about these Bills, with the massive 74 points in the explanatory memoranda, and the most important effect it has on the levels of employment. I also note that in Singapore over the past few years the country's Central Provident Fund has been gradually extended. That particular scheme now has a level of contributions from the employer of 15 per cent, but a much higher payment from the employee of 23 per cent. The most salient point is that during the mid-1980s, when there was a recession, the Government allowed a reduction in the level of contributions from the employers, a completely different situation to what we have in this country, where the Government during a recession is asking the employers to pay more.

         Australia should compare the Singaporean scheme with the moves in this Bill by the Keating Government to impose further compulsory superannuation contributions on the employers, no matter what the individual company's circumstances are, let alone what the national circumstances are. Perhaps that is why Singapore has advanced economically relative to Australia. This Keating Government now proposes to load onto employers an additional cost with little thought as to the consequences.

         Unlike the training guarantee levy, the superannuation guarantee levy offers little, if any, prospect of the employers being able to negotiate offsetting productivity agreements. Interestingly, as the honourable member for Curtin mentioned in his speech, a deputy secretary of the Treasury recently let the cat out of the bag when he commented to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation that these extra superannuation benefits to employees would be partly funded by cancellation or a reduction in wage increases. The Committee made the observation; it has the understanding that there will be an offset on genuine wage increases.

         Is this what individual Australians want? I would have thought that most employees want the freedom to choose what they themselves do with their after-tax earnings. Many employees under the age of 35 may wish to pay off their mortgages more quickly rather than have access to increased superannuation. However, this Bill will deny them that option, because their real earnings will decline over the next eight years if Australians are forced to accept these superannuation increases as a substitute for wage increases. That is the thrust of the ACTU policy. Bill Kelty and the Prime Minister, in advocating that point of view, have on the record made  superannuation a substitute for wage increases, either implicitly or up front.

         The second largest provider of superannuation to Australians is the National Mutual Life Association. I would expect that, like other insurance companies, it is broadly in favour of any measure that would improve its revenue, as this Bill will do over the next eight years. However, National Mutual has made the following comment about this Bill—and I ask honourable members to note that this is not coming from the Opposition or any industry group of employers unconnected with the superannuation industry:

        What a very important observation that is. The Government is presuming that every business in Australia will be equally as profitable. That last proposition, which is enshrined in the legislation, is an absurd proposition, as every businessman knows. For instance, in Victoria the construction industry is at a much lower ebb than food processors—although I note that Pacific Dunlop Ltd, with its Edgell closures in recent days, commented on Australia's lack of competitiveness and said that its rationalisation was not as a result of tariffs.

         Australia's low household savings ratio of between 4 and 6 per cent is of great concern, especially when it is compared with the average in many other countries. A good example is Germany, which has a rate of around about the 12 per cent. That is up to three times Australia's pathetic effort to increase its savings ratio. However, there is little evidence that an increase in the flow of superannuation from employers will lead to higher savings from households. It is appropriate for the Government to abandon this legislation. Individuals should be allowed to temporarily withdraw superannuation contributions to pave the way for a deposit on a first house, as the coalition's visionary Fightback package proposes.

If they suddenly find themselves to be over the limit, their costs will in the next year suddenly rise from 3 to 5 per cent on the superannuation side.

         The Government's inflexibility and willingness to hit employers hard, even when they lack the capacity to pay, contrasts with the coalition's superannuation policy, which will restore some sanity to this area but, most importantly, will not allow blinkered ideology to preside over a further loss of jobs.

         —Last week the results of a Morgan gallup poll showed that an overwhelming majority of Australians believe that tackling unemployment is the most pressing task faced by the Federal Government. In fact, 74 per cent of Australians ranked unemployment as one of the three most important political issues in Australia—and no wonder.

         In recent times, unemployment in Australia has reached its highest level since the Great Depression and close to one million people are now out of work. Clearly, the overriding priority for the present Government must be to generate new job opportunities, particularly by fostering industries, small business and the farming communities. It is almost unbelievable, therefore, that the Superannuation Guarantee Charge Bill, the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill and the Superannuation Guarantee (Consequential Amendments) Bill should be so totally at odds with this vital objective.

         It has been calculated that this legislation will result in nothing short of a massive increase in unemployment due to the impact it will have on business costs. Indeed, as many as 100,000 Australians will lose their jobs because of this legislation. I, for one, cannot think of one reason why the Government should be prepared to introduce any policy which will put so many Australians out on the streets, which will create so much misery amongst Australian families, and which will drive another nail in the coffin of the Australian economy. One of the Government's recent Treasurers, who lost his seat when the music stopped playing, summed up the looming difficulties by saying:

        In this financial year alone, the provision of pensions will cost Australian taxpayers some $12 billion. Clearly, something must be done immediately if we are to prevent a massive blow-out in the nation's pension welfare budget in the coming years.

         Of course, the most appropriate option is to encourage Australians to provide for their own financial needs in retirement. Greater reliance on superannuation, along with other investments designed to give people income during their retirement, will result in less reliance on the pension and, consequently, less strain on the taxation system. Both of the nation's major political parties acknowledge the desperate need to reduce the overall dependence on pension support. However, the ways that we have gone about planning to achieve this vital objective could not be any more different, as this legislation before the House demonstrates.

         This legislation builds on the Government's policy of providing superannuation entitlements for some employees by forcing the employers to pay the premiums for them. It sets the scene for a new form of payroll tax—to be called the superannuation guarantee levy—which would come into force on 1 July this year and would compel all employers to make compulsory superannuation contributions on behalf of their employees or be subject to a tough new tax. The cost to business of this new super tax would depend on its total payroll. Whereas small businesses with payrolls of $500,000 would pay 3 per cent, bigger businesses would be forced to pay 5 per cent of the value of their annual payroll or meet the new tax requirements. Over the next eight years, these rates will be steadily increased to 9 per cent of payroll, regardless of how big the business might be.

         In this way, the Government argues, Australians will become increasingly less dependent on age pensions in their retirement years. The current Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), like his predecessor, argues that the new super tax will increase the level of national savings, thus reducing our reliance on the savings of foreigners to fund our development. In other words, the Government is saying, `Trust us, this new tax will help reduce the nation's foreign debt'. How can anyone take this seriously—especially when we consider that the present Government has presided over the worst blow-out in foreign debt in Australia's history? In June 1982, gross foreign debt stood at $24 billion. In June last year the figure was $173 billion. That is an increase of just on 140 per cent over the period.

When the Treasurer says that his legislation will help reduce foreign debt, forgive me for being a little sceptical.

         Interestingly, as this objective is supposed to be so important to the Government, it seems strange that the Treasurer's second reading speech contained only a brief mention of it. There was absolutely no detailed explanation of the extent to which this new super tax would increase the nation's savings. The reason for this is now well known, thanks to the probing of my colleagues in the Senate, which revealed that there is very little evidence that the new super tax would result in significant increases in national savings.

         Under questioning by my colleague the shadow Minister for social security, child-care and retirement incomes, the Deputy Secretary to the Government's Treasury Department, Dr Alan Preston, admitted that there is no hard-core evidence supporting the contention that the Government's new compulsory superannuation policy would boost national savings significantly over time. This contradicts the line persistently pushed by the Government in support of its draconian legislation.

        Now we have the latest Treasurer repeating the same claim, despite a total lack of evidence to back it up. This says a lot about the lack of integrity of this Government. Only now that the Government has been caught out in this way has it decided to establish an economic modelling group to examine superannuation issues. This is nothing short of a blatant admission by the Government that the legislation before the House has no factual basis whatsoever and that respective Ministers have tried to con the Australian public by saying that its new super tax would achieve results—for which, as they knew, there was no factual support.

         What about the Government's other major justification for this far-reaching legislation—that it will reduce the cost of age pensions? Again, Treasury's answers to questions in the Senate reveal that there is no objective basis for this claim either. When asked what calculations or predictions had been done to determine this legislation's effect on the number of people on the pension in 20 or 30 years time, or the financial savings to the Government owing to this legislation, Treasury's deputy head said:
        </tab>

       <para>
        This means that neither of the Government's two main arguments in support of this legislation stacks up. And yet, despite a total lack of evidence about the long term impact of the new super tax, the Government is prepared to push ahead with its plans. Despite widespread opposition to the legislation around the nation, the Government says its new super tax is essential in order to achieve ongoing benefits, without being able to prove that those long term objectives will ever be realised.

         Now that we have determined that the legislation will not necessarily achieve the aims set out by the Government, what impact will it have? The most obvious concern is that the new super tax would be a very significant additional cost to small and big business alike. As it is based entirely on the business payroll, the new super tax would be nothing short of a Federal payroll tax. More importantly, once it is completely phased in, the superannuation levy will be almost double the average prevailing rate of State payroll tax. Importantly, there will be no exemptions to this new tax for small business. If a small business does not take out the required amount of superannuation for each employee, the business must remit a levy to the Taxation Office in its place. This levy will not be tax deductible. It is no wonder the coalition, the Taxation Institute of Australia and every major business group around Australia has slammed the Government's new legislation.

         The Australian Bureau of Statistics, in its latest survey of business labour costs, confirmed that payroll tax was the biggest labour oncost by far in every State, with the Victorian and Western Australian State governments heading up the list of big taxes. Around Australia, 9.8 per cent of business labour costs were due to payroll tax, compared with 10.7 per cent in Victoria and 10 per cent in Western Australia, both of which are renowned for their addiction to high taxes.

         Many people seem to think that the small business sector is exempt from payroll tax, but this simply is not true. The ABS survey found that small businesses as a whole, being those with less than 20 employees, paid 7.2 per cent of total labour costs as payroll tax, which is not far behind the average of 9.8 per cent for all businesses. Clearly, the States payroll taxes are a major burden on small business, which is why the coalition is committed to scrapping payroll tax altogether. Despite the existing cost burden of the existing State payroll tax system, the Federal Government wants to impose its own kind of payroll tax at a much higher rate.

         On average, businesses already pay the equivalent of 3.4 per cent of their total labour costs to superannuation. The impact of eventually being forced to pay a further 9 per cent of their payroll is obvious. Incidentally, these figures are important for another reason: they demonstrate that the business sector already pays, on average, the equivalent of 3.7 per cent of total earnings in the form of superannuation. This is well in excess of the 3 per cent compulsory contribution imposed in 1986 and demonstrates that, whilst some businesses cannot afford and are not required to pay superannuation on behalf of their employees, the business community as a whole is pulling its weight.

We cannot squeeze blood out of a stone. The business community, especially small business, simply cannot afford to pay the cost involved in achieving this aim, nor should it. This extra cost burden will send many businesses to the wall and will force others to lay off staff to reduce their exposure to Labor's new super tax.

There are 850,000 businesses across the nation and it is easy to see how Dr Murphy's economic model demonstrates an increase in unemployment of up to 100,000 people.

Clearly, the Government accepts that its new superannuation levy will be a major cost burden for small business, particularly as it changed its mind earlier this year and allowed an extra year for businesses with payrolls under $500,000 before their levy obligation is increased from 3 per cent to 4 per cent.

         Across Australia there is widespread recognition of the importance of helping to make small businesses more competitive, and in particular of reducing business costs. Unfortunately, instead of working towards removing taxes on business, such as payroll tax, the Government is going to add to them quite considerably. Compare this with the coalition's plans to scrap seven business taxes and to cut business costs by $20 billion across the nation. Instead of introducing a new tax based on employers wage bills, we are committed to scrapping payroll tax so that the costs are reduced for those businesses which currently pay this tax, as well as for businesses that do not pay the tax directly but which buy goods from businesses which do.

        The Australian Taxpayers Institute has slammed the way the new levy must be met on a monthly basis from 1993-94 onwards. The employer will be able to pay his or her year's super levy in one go without incurring huge penalties. This means that employers will have to make all their wages and superannuation calculations every month to ensure they know the minimum required level of superannuation support for each employee, as well as the level of actual employer support for the month.

       <para first-indent="16">

          Obviously the 100,000 or so who stand to lose their jobs will not welcome the Government's plans.

        During questioning at a Senate committee hearing, the deputy head of Treasury let the cat out of the bag when he said that the only way in which employers could avoid paying the full cost of these measures was for employees to go without wage rises.

         It is ironic that this legislation is supposed to provide a long term benefit for employees, yet it will put many out of work. Those lucky enough to hold onto their jobs stand to suffer further reductions in real wages that will be put aside because of this Government's new super tax.

Worse still, the Government's new super tax will have a severe impact on the business sector, especially small business, which would have to pay the extra cost of this levy and comply with new paperwork requirements. Even the very employees who are supposed to benefit from superannuation stand to be the big losers, as many will lose their jobs if this new super tax is introduced, while those still in the work force will have to forgo pay rises in coming years. For those reasons, the coalition strongly opposes this legislation.

The latter Bill is very brief; its only purpose is to comply with section 55 of the Constitution which requires a Bill imposing a tax or charge to deal only with that matter. The Bills are designed to implement the Government's decision announced in the 1991-92 Budget to impose a non-tax deductible levy on employers who fail to provide superannuation support at a minimum percentage level of employees' earnings, which will be automatically and progressively increased over time to reach at least 9 per cent by the year 2000.

         The Confederation of Australian Industry has come out in very strong opposition to what the Government is proposing. It is strongly opposed to the levy, and its main arguments are based on the effect it will have on investment and unemployment. It stresses the unemployment aspect. The CAI argues that enterprises currently not providing superannuation will be required to meet the cost of contributions or the levy from their retained earnings. The reduction in retained earnings will reduce the amount available for enterprises—and that is all businesses—particularly small and medium sized enterprises. I guess in the electorate of Bendigo most of the businesses would fall into that category. Most of them are small, family owned businesses; there are some medium sized enterprises; and there is only a handful of large ones. But all of them have been in contact with me expressing their concern about the imposition of a further cost.

         The CAI argues also that the amount available for enterprises, particularly small and medium sized enterprises, to reinvest in the enterprise will be limited, and this will result in lower investment back into the business. The alternative will be for these firms to borrow the funds at a high cost for investment, but the funds likely to be available for small to medium firms may not increase to offset the reduction in retained earnings. This is due to the practice of superannuation investments being channelled into the larger, blue-chip firms. As the proportion of available capital invested in these bodies increases, there is a reduction in the proportion of capital available to small or medium firms. That would be disastrous for many firms, particularly in Victoria where the state of the economy is the worst it has been for 60 years or more and the level of economic activity at this time is extremely low.

         As well, according to the CAI, the small to medium firm will face the increased costs associated with that borrowing. However, these effects may be offset by the fact that not all retained profits are reinvested, so that funds need not be channelled from investment but may come from other uses of retained earnings and the additional cost of borrowing may not be sufficient to effect many rational investment decisions, which are based on many criteria. I do not quite agree exactly with the Confederation of Australian Industry on that point, but I am sure that its next point will hit home with the Government.

         The Confederation of Australian Industry makes the point that the superannuation guarantee levy will impose an additional cost on employers that, in the current recessed climate, will force them to reduce costs by shedding labour. That is what I am being told right now in the city of Bendigo. In the Bendigo electorate, the unemployment rate is high. It is running at 25.9 per cent in the shire of Bet Bet and 16 per cent in Bendigo and Maryborough. Youth unemployment is running at a rate of 46 per cent. Almost 7,000 people are out of work in the Bendigo area at present.

         The Government through this levy is forcing additional costs onto employers, whose only alternative will be to reduce costs by shedding more labour. The additional cost will be sufficient to drive some small to medium enterprises into liquidation. I would have thought that the Government would have realised the damage that it has done, particularly to the Victorian economy, in view of the number of small businesses which have gone into liquidation and receivership over the past two or three years.

         The CAI argues also that the superannuation guarantee levy will result in increased unemployment. It has estimated that the effect of the superannuation guarantee levy, the SGL, will be to put at risk between 45,000 and 60,000 jobs. I know for a fact that it will have a dramatic impact on my electorate. The figures I have quoted show that every business there is looking very hard at its work force because of the depressed economic conditions. It is not a matter of putting people on;  they are asking, `How can we reduce staff and maintain a business and keep it viable to get us through the recession?'. It should also be noted that superannuation contributions made by an employer are tax deductible, while the superannuation guarantee levy will not be deductible.

         Another criticism of the superannuation guarantee levy—it also applied to the training guarantee levy—is that it resembles a payroll tax.

The enterprises, as I have said, are just hanging on now. They are finding it extremely difficult, not only because of the recession, but also because of the difficult times the rural sector has had.

         One thing that the Government really has overlooked relates to national savings. It has provided no incentive at all for employee contributions. There is no requirement for an employee contribution. I would have thought that any superannuation scheme would have had a higher value and would have been much more attractive had a contribution been made by the employee as well as by the employer. It has been argued that this would, in fact, reduce the value of the contribution made by the employer, as perceived by the employee, while reducing the end benefit available and increasing the employer's costs, compared with a situation where both the employer and the employee are required to contribute to their superannuation.

         Self-employed people are some of the losers under this legislation. I want to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), who is sitting at the table. It is a very difficult time for self-employed business people to operate their businesses. They work long hours. Of course, they choose to do that; but in the past three years, particularly in the Bendigo area, those self-employed business people have been working extremely long hours for little or no profit. The fact that the superannuation guarantee levy legislation does not require any level of contribution for self-employed persons may be a blessing.

         It really misses the mark on that aspect. There are a tremendous number of self-employed people who run small businesses in country areas. I am sure that the Minister would recognise that. What opportunity do they have?  They have to take out a private superannuation scheme, which we encourage. It is part of our policy to encourage people to take out those private superannuation funds so that they can make provision for their future. My comment to the Minister is this: if it is so important to force retirement income down the throats of the work force, there is no good reason why the self-employed should be excluded under this legislation. I fail to see what the Government really has in view there. If the whole idea is to have retirement income provisions, why is the Government leaving out self-employed people in this legislation?

         Access Economics also had some very interesting things to say about this legislation, particularly on the matters of inflation and unemployment. It has predicted that the Government's proposals will, if passed, lead to a 5 per cent increase in inflation and the loss of at least 60,000 jobs through the 1990s. So it concurs with the Confederation of Australian Industry. The only way such a scheme could possibly succeed, without putting thousands out of work and refuelling inflation, would be for the increases to be at the expense of wage rises—in other words, to require Australian workers to forgo significant wage increases over the next decade in order to disqualify themselves from the age pension. The more likely outcome is that the cost of superannuation will be met from funds which would otherwise have been used by businesses to reinvest, generate new jobs and expand activities.

         It is a matter of fact that, as Treasurer, the now Prime Minister (Mr Keating) visited a conference of the Australian Council of Trade Unions in Sydney some years ago at which he informed it that its industrial muscle was in decline. Might I add that by his actions he has been the principal contributor to that, notwithstanding that neither he nor his union mates at the ACTU are yet aware of it. By deregulating so many aspects of the Australian economy, he has forced upon Australia the deregulation of the labour market. Government members will bury their heads in the sand on that issue, but it would occur even if they were to remain in office.

        Given the favoured taxation treatment of investment through superannuation funds, a lever exists to redirect part of their investment portfolio to longer term growth and expansion objectives.

        For quite some time the ACTU has had its eye on some substantial amounts of money coming from superannuation, and it has this wonderful plan as to how government might manage that in the national interest.

         I will give honourable members one simple example of one of the major funds to whom this Government is going to deliver all these additional moneys. Let us take, for example, a fund with a holding of $100m or $200m worth of BHP shares which are trading at, say, $10—I do not know their current value. The fund manager has a look at the old balance sheet and realises that it is not getting on as well as it should, so he goes out and buys another couple of million dollars worth of BHP shares at, say, $11. He will be a bit more cunning than that and will probably push the shares up 20c a day for one or two weeks, at the end of which he will have got them up by about $2.

         He then revalues $200m or maybe $500m of the shares he is holding and declares that a profit. It has done nothing for the nation; it has not built one extra factory. In fact, it has not laid one extra brick. Of course, the fund was doing the same thing in the property market: if it owned 10 top skyscrapers it would buy another one for 20 per cent more than it was worth and revalue the other ones by 20 per cent. I wonder whether the wizard across the road with, I think, some academic degrees has ever thought how that works. One can ask oneself how else it would work. There is only one means by which businesses increase in value, and that is by producing more profits. Those opposite can look back and see that throughout the boom, other than with this ramping process, very few of them did: it was not by productivity. We find within the Australian economy a very interesting graph situation when we put productivity growth and GDP growth on the same page, with GDP growth flashing away in an upward direction from productivity growth because in the 1980s and the early 1990s this country has run on debt, not on productivity.

         If those opposite think they are going to force people to save money by putting it into these funds, with the ambition of the ACTU to have most of it reinvested in Australia, they should look at the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Business Review Weekly
         </emphasis>
         of 4 August 1989, which lists the 10 top fund managers. It tells us where they invested their money. Bankers Trust had more than 40 per cent—nearly half—of its investments in Australian equities. National Mutual had all its funds in BHP, WMC, NAB, Elders, CRA and BTR. AMP Balanced had its money in the top 10 banks, Coles-Myer, CSR, Amcor, MIM, CRA, North Broken Hill and Caltex. I ask the Minister whether he has heard even one middle sized business mentioned yet. How much more money does he want to be put into these people? How much higher does he want the value of their shares to go while they produce not one whit more? That is where the Government's national savings are going to go.

         As we know, things have been so bad economically in Australia that the opportunity—which this Bill will not assist—to make profits with the present wage structures, et cetera, is such that the AMP, the largest of these funds, has now gone offshore and has started to buy itself insurance companies in England. It will get a return for the shareholders, for the contributors, but it will not reinvest in Australia unless the returns are adequate.

         Primarily, the purpose of such funds, because of their huge holdings, is to participate in the share market in a way that delivers nothing. We do not see them coming in when someone else has a new float, unless it is the floating of the Commonwealth Bank

        or something. When somebody comes up with a bit of a risky investment we will not find these funds being ripped off employers in the so-called interest of the employee; we will not find any of that being invested in greenfield propositions. These big funds will sit back and wait; they are almost obliged to do so.

         Why would the Government be forcing people to put part of their earnings there?  The Prime Minister has said it is coming; it has being paid by the employer but there is 10 per cent that employees will not get—the Government's own constituency. What are people going to get for it? They will get an investment in the AMP, an investment in the ramping of the share market and the property market, but no investment in the growth of Australia. It is just forcing up the value of existing companies. If the Minister thinks that is smart, he is stupid. That is where I started my speech and that is where I will finish it.

         —It is fairly unusual for the Opposition to take the opportunity to speak on the third reading of a Bill. But I have to do so, and I am delighted to see that at last the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) has come into the chamber because we required him to come in for the vote. The fact is that we have had this debate in the chamber for a number of hours and we have not seen the Treasurer in the House to take charge of this, his own, legislation. Furthermore, he did not bother to speak in the debate; nor did he bother to comment on remarks made by me and various other members of the House from both sides. It merely demonstrates yet again what we see in this House time and time again, which is a total unwillingness by members of this Government to face up to their responsibilities as parliamentarians to this House and all members of this House.

         It is simply not good enough for the Treasurer once again to leave the chamber during what is his legislation. How does he expect the people of Australia to regard this legislation? They know that it is of such fundamental importance that it will affect the lifestyles and the saving capacity—and in fact the very employment—of hundreds of thousands of Australian citizens who have no control over their destiny, who have no say in what happens to them under this legislation. This is simply a sordid deal between the Government and the ACTU.

         Throughout all the elements of this debate those words come through: a deal has been struck and it will be consummated in this Parliament. It is my belief and it is certainly the belief of the Opposition that when the legislation gets to the other place the Government will find the going far more difficult because it has failed during the inquiry of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation to demonstrate any case whatsoever which would support the very principles upon which it alleges this legislation should be based. For example, it has failed to demonstrate to the Senate and certainly to the House of Representatives why these proposals will not have a major cost in terms of employment in this country.

         At Question Time today we had evidence put forward to demonstrate absolutely that in the words of the Treasury alone in the next five years over 100,000 jobs will simply not exist because of the additional costs brought on employers as a result of this legislation. Clearly, one has to assume that these are mere bagatelles; they are not matters of great significance. Who is going to care? I can tell the Government who is going to care: the Australian people. I can tell the Government who is going to speak for them in this place; it will be members of the Liberal and National parties. It is we and we alone who stand up at this time to demonstrate as well as we can that compulsory superannuation legislation of this nature is fundamentally flawed. It will do nothing to overcome the real problems about which we have heard so much from all members in this debate tonight—the problems of a greying society and the problem that by the year 2020 we will have a ratio of 3:1 compared with the  current rate of 7:1.  These are  fundamental  issues.

         Where is the Treasurer? Why is he not here? Why is he not taking through this legislation? Why has he not spoken in this debate? We are now on the third reading of this legislation. I trust that at this late stage the Minister will take the opportunity to take his place at the dispatch box and explain to the House—as he endeavoured to do but failed to do after Question Time today—why the comments made by the Treasury officials at the Senate committee inquiry, in response to the very sensible questions put to them by the shadow Minister for

         It is simply not good enough to come up with a deal, put together by the Government and the ACTU, based on a range of propositions which, when they are tested, are found to be fundamentally flawed. These are important decisions. They are matters of great moment. I earnestly hope that we will not see a continuation of the arrogance of the Treasurer as we have in the last few hours, that he will enter this debate and he will answer the fundamental issues which have been put to him by me and by other speakers in this debate this evening.

        Since the introduction of the Bill on 2 April 1992, the Government has received a number of representations concerning various aspects of the Bill. In response to those representations the Government has decided to make amendments to the Bill. Some terms used in the Bill are also to be clarified.

         The first significant change will be to allow prepayments of superannuation contributions to be taken into account in determining, in certain cases, whether superannuation guarantee charge requirements have been met. Under the existing Bill, for the 1993-94 and subsequent years of income, contributions made within 28 days after the end of a contribution period—that is, any of the 12 months of the year—may be taken into account for that contribution period. However, contributions made prior to a contribution period cannot be taken into account in that period. The amendment will enable contributions paid prior to a particular contribution period to be taken into account for that period, provided the contribution is made within 12 months of the beginning of the period.

         The second important change is to introduce a further category of employee who is excluded from the superannuation guarantee arrangements. The category is to be set out in regulations and is to include those employees who are overseas executives of international corporations who come to Australia on a temporary basis to establish a branch of the company or to join an existing branch in a managerial or executive capacity. The effect of the amendment will be that superannuation contributions do not need to be made by an employer on behalf of these overseas executives.

         —As this has been a cognate debate, I would like to make a few observations about various aspects of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1992. Firstly, I was intrigued to notice that the SGL legislation does not require any levels of contribution for self-employed persons. This is a matter, among others, which I would have hoped the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) would have been able to explain to us: how it is possible to argue a case for a so-called universal scheme, but at the same time ignore the realities that many hundreds of thousands of people are self-employed and are as entitled as anybody else, therefore, to access the welfare and the pension system upon retirement. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to presume that the system should also encourage them to be in it, whether it be through the 23FC funds or, perhaps, to join the schemes which may already be on the marketplace.

         Nevertheless, as I have regrettably made my remarks in the third reading debate, the opportunity to seek this information is apparently not open to us. No doubt the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Johns) will do his best to answer what we all know is an extremely complex matter.

         The other matter I would like to refer to is the question of part time and casual employees. As I said in the second reading debate, the evidence is fairly clear: there will be those who will do worst out of a so-called compulsory superannuation system; in fact, some two million people fit that category, and most of them are women. Most of them, even under this legislation, are going to be in a situation where they may well be excluded because of the very low levels of their income.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The argument that the Government, presumably, has put up is that their exclusion is due to the fact that the administrative costs of handling such small amounts do not make their inclusion worthwhile. On that point, therefore, I have to draw attention to the Opposition's policy in relation to the provision of what we call retirement savings accounts. We like to think that the retirement savings account is one of the great initiatives of the last few years in terms of the Opposition's contribution to the debate on retirement income. They would work basically the same as bank accounts and be as simple as bank accounts. They would have an advantage in that a part time worker coming in and out of the work force would be able to make contributions when he is so able. The funds would remain there and they would go up with the normal effluxion of time and the accumulation of interest. The administrative charges would be extremely low, if at all; in fact, they would probably compare with the same charge rates currently applying to savings accounts with banks.

         In relation to overall employees, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the problem of the effect of this legislation. For example, Coles Myer, is the country's largest private employer with 135,000 employees and will certainly be required to fit the payroll category of $500,000 or more. Therefore by the year 2000 and subsequent years it would be in a position where it would be expected to fund at least 9 per cent. It is interesting to note that, of that significant number of employees, 32 per cent are regular casuals under the age of 21. Coles Myer had this to say:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Not only would there be a significant administration burden for both the company and funds if such employees are to receive employer funded occupational superannuation, but there would be no real gain for the individual in terms of retirement income.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, that fact is based on its assessment, which is correct, that the administrative costs of funding such a scheme would, in most cases, be well over 1 1/2 per cent of notional contributions. Consequently, whether one is referring to people in that category or, as I said, in relation to women—and we are talking about no less than two million non-working women in the work force—

         —One of the fundamental weaknesses of this legislation—and they are many, a myriad—is the reality that the Government has ignored the presence in the Australian community of over two million non-working women who have been denied access to the alleged benefits despite the fact that women not only live longer than men, but they are also particularly financially vulnerable in their retirement years in the event of early widowhood or divorce. That is, incidentally, an observation made by no less than the ACTU itself. Therefore, I am surprised, if not shocked, to see, since the ACTU has regarded itself, rightly or wrongly, as being the dynamo, the driving force, behind all of these legislative changes, that it has totally ignored the realities of the need for retirement income for over two million Australian women.

         Again, the Opposition has faced up to this problem. We have made a fundamental change in the whole structure of superannuation funding with the effect that we would permit people to have a tax deductibility of 25 per cent up to annual contributions of $6,000 a year. I might add that under this legislation the Government is offering only $4,000 a year. So there is a significantly greater advantage in our proposals than in the Government's.

         But, side by side with that, we are effectively saying to a married couple that, if they wish to finance the superannuation and retirement income of their spouse, that woman, or man as the case may be, would also be entitled to be funded up to $6,000 a year. So effectively the combined family contribution rate would be $12,000, to all of which the 25 per cent tax rebate would apply. That is an extremely generous package and it is far beyond the very narrow boundaries of this ridiculous piece of legislation that we are debating here tonight.

         I will not hold the House up any longer on this particular Bill save to say that the response which employers have made to clauses in this legislation—particularly in relation to their concern about whether they are in the half a million dollar or less category, where their funding rate will be 3 per cent in 1982-83 going up to 9 per cent in subsequent years after the year 2000, or in the payroll category of half a million or more where the rate would start off at 5 per cent and go up to 9 per cent in the year 2000 and beyond—has been unanimous. It is simply that this legislation will cost jobs at the very time when Australia, like most other developed countries, regrettably, appears to be going into a phase of our economic development where periods of unemployment in excess of 12 months may well be the norm. This, unfortunately, is a statistical fact.

         If one analyses the last 20 years, one will see that at one stage unemployment over three months was regarded as long term. Then it went to six months; then it went to nine months; and now it is out to 12 months. One can look at the reality of how long it took to work through the unemployed from the period of the 1983 recession; the answer is that it took nearly seven years. I wonder how many years it is going to take the million-odd people who have lost their jobs in the last 12 months or so in Australia to find jobs.

         I wonder how many of them are going to be told that one reason why they cannot find jobs is that they are too expensive to employ. Why are they too expensive to employ? It is because of the myriad of taxes and charges which are levied on big and small business alike. It is at this time that those charges should be removed. The Fightback package is directly aimed at doing precisely that, that is, removing seven fundamental taxes from the Australian taxation system and, above all, removing taxes on wages and taxes on employment. The sad fact about this legislation is that it is, indeed, an additional tax on employment.

He amazes me when he talks about what the Opposition has done in relation to women in the work force and, particularly, women in relation to superannuation. I spoke on the Superannuation Guarantee Administration Bill earlier tonight, but I will repeat it so that he will hear it because obviously he did not get it right. When the Opposition was last in office in 1983, the overall proportion of workers with any type of superannuation entitlements was only 39 per cent, with the rate being 50 per cent for male workers and a miserable 24 per cent for female employees. I remind the honourable member for Bradfield that today these figures have risen to 72 per cent for the work force as a whole with 80.6 per cent of male workers and 78.5 per cent of female workers. That is an increase from 24 per cent to 78.5 per cent of female workers, and that is a pretty fair effort in itself.

         This legislation before us tonight will further improve that because so many women, particularly, will benefit from the employer superannuation fund. The honourable member for Bradfield also needs to realise that in providing the superannuation obviously there will be a need to negotiate, through the industrial arena, ways of implementing the increase in the superannuation fund. Employers have failed, of course. They had been given the opportunity, under the superannuation provisions, under the award provisions, to respond in a positive way. This legislation is now necessary because they have failed to respond, and it is necessary now to force employers who have failed to provide sensible superannuation for their employees. So it has got to this stage for that simple reason.

Surely, the self-employed people have enough brains to provide for their own retirement through their own superannuation funds. What we are talking about here is providing superannuation for employees. That is the important part. If, of course, the self-employed people do not provide for their own superannuation or their own retirement, something will be need to be done with that, I do not doubt, in the longer term. But this particular legislation relates to employees. I think we need to clearly understand that.

         For many years, before this Government took the action it did in improving superannuation for so many people in the work force, there was the big incentive for self-employed people to go into superannuation funds, mainly as a tax concession. I think we all realise that. One of the fastest growing industries under the previous Liberal Government was the tax avoidance industry. We used to see all this money being channelled into superannuation funds purely for tax benefits. I think most self-employed people are smart enough to realise that, and I think the honourable member for Bradfield is putting them down somewhat by suggesting that they need to be included in this in any way. I wanted to correct a few misunderstandings by the honourable member for Bradfield, and I hope that we will get these amendments through quite comfortably.

        At the time I made that speech there was virtually no public awareness that the fiftieth anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea was only two years away.

         All honourable members will be aware that over the past few days the United States Secretary of Defense, Mr Cheney, and Secretary of Education, Mr Alexander, have been in Australia as official guests for the Coral Sea anniversary celebrations and ceremonies. In addition, a number of US Navy ships are paying goodwill visits to various Australian ports. However, I believe that it should be placed on record here that, as well as the substantial contribution made by both the Australian and US governments to our commemoration of the Battle of the Coral Sea, a significant contribution has been made by ordinary Australians—a number of whom have for many years put considerable personal effort into maintaining within this country an awareness of the importance to Australia of its American alliance.

         This afternoon at the Australian War Memorial, Secretary Alexander unveiled a new display in the `War in the Pacific' section, dedicated to the Battle of the Coral Sea. This display was a community initiative. Various individuals—both American and Australian—and organisations contributed approximately $100,000 towards its cost. I hasten to add that the War Memorial itself contributed an amount more than equal to that. Furthermore, notwithstanding the community support—notably through the Australian-American Association—that the project attracted, its successful completion owes a great deal to the enthusiastic support of the War Memorial Chairman, Dame Beryl Beaurepaire, and the Director, Brendon Kelson.

It graphically portrays, including through the use of military archival film taken at the time, the military tactics of the Japanese fleet—namely, to secure Port Moresby from the sea, to attack allied bases at Thursday Island, Cooktown and Townsville, and, at the least, to force Australia out of the war.

         It is now a well-documented part of history that the damage inflicted on the Japanese Navy in the Battle of the Coral Sea was a decisive factor in the United States Navy's victory in the Battle of Midway less than one month later. From that point on, Japan had no chance of winning the war. The battle indeed turned the tide. We owe much to the courage and skills of the American sailors in the Battle of the Coral Sea.

         It is particularly fitting that we should acknowledge the 543 Americans who lost their lives in that battle. This landmark display at the Australian War Memorial will serve to make future generations of Australians aware of how great was the peril of our country in those days referred to as Australia's darkest, and how important strong alliances are to our national security.

         —Over the last few days the Australian press has carried details of race riots in American cities, principally Los Angeles, following the decision of the jury in what has become known as the Rodney King case. This has led to a wide range of leading articles in Australian newspapers, some adverse journalistic comment about the inadequacy of the American jury system, and questions as to how, within the framework of the American legal process, a jury of laymen could make such a grievous error.

         While many of the propositions advanced in the editorials are soundly based, I advise our editorial writers, before they get too moralistic and start reflecting on the US judicial system and its impact on race relations, that they would do well to pause and consider why, over some years, many of those writers have not felt the same level of editorial erudition and moralising when it comes to our own judicial system.

         If laymen on a jury in the United States can in the light of the available evidence get it so wrong, to use the popular term, what do we say of a High Court composed of Australia's most distinguished lawyers when, in the light of all the available evidence to the contrary, they endorsed and accepted the doctrine of terras nullius? Terras nullius was the notion that some 200 years ago this island continent was unoccupied and nobody owned it by right of prior occupation. Because it was an empty place and unoccupied, its annexation was therefore legitimate.

         Not only was Australia occupied; scientific evidence suggests a continual occupation for some 60,000 years. As Aboriginal legends and religious belief make no reference to migration, there is no scientific evidence to contradict the Aboriginal belief that Australia as they knew it was the ultimate source of their origin. At the time the British, French, Dutch and Portuguese visited our shores, this island continent was divided by boundaries well known and understood by its own group of Aboriginal peoples and by their neighbours, and supported by religious and spiritual beliefs centred upon their occupation of their own land.

         There is no legal concept as perverse, myopic and riddled with the mores of the occupying colonial power as terras nullius. We may well ask, in the light of the enormous and ever-expanding body of research, how our distinguished judges got it wrong. Even now, compared with Canada, Mexico, the United States, New Zealand and even South Africa, Australia continues to refuse to legally recognise the prior occupation and possession of this land by its indigenous people.

         Australia, as a multicultural society, prides itself on its capacity to absorb people of mixed background, religion and origins. However, Australia in 1992 has yet to come to terms with the rights of its own indigenous people. The maintenance and continuation of the concept of terras nullius within our legal structure shames not only our judicial system but also our nation. It is a concept that should be rejected by this Parliament and by our High Court.

         The legal doctrine should attract at least some of the same attention of our editorial writers as the recent events in Los Angeles. Perhaps it is easier for journalists, as it is for the rest of us, to moralise about the event in the United States and to proffer advice rather than to face the reality of our own history. The sad and tragic fact of the history of the second settlement of Australia is that the genocide of and the denial of fundamental human rights to our indigenous people—the first Australians—not only has distorted and falsified our history, but some 200 years later has recorded them as the most deprived of all our citizens.

         If the process of reconciliation now being undertaken by this Parliament is to become at all relevant to Aboriginal Australia, it should begin by clearly rejecting the concept of terras nullius, and hopefully in so doing it will have the support not only of our editorial writers but also of our judiciary.

         —As I foreshadowed last night, I would have liked to take the adjournment debate tonight and every night this week to give the story of some of the carers of people with disabilities in my home State of South Australia. Unfortunately, time is not with me tonight and I have only one minute in which to speak. In that time I shall refer briefly to a letter I received from a couple in South Australia who live not in my electorate but in the area of Berri. I shall skip over some of the letter to get to the point of the story. The mother writes:

        We have 2 severely intellectually disabled boys. . . I am constantly exhausted from caring for the boys who have a mental age of 2.
       </para>
       <para>
        She describes how the boys, at the age of 17 or 18, wander from home and need constant care, their food cut up, toilet assistance and assistance in everything that needs to be done. She talks of her own tiredness. She finishes by saying:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        There has to come a breaking point. Either the Government has to recognize the plight of the intellectually disabled in regard to accommodation or parents end up in hospitals suffering total physical and emotional fatigue.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the story of many families in South Australia who have children with intellectual disabilities or head injuries. The present Government has not come to their aid. They are worse off than they were before. With the current philosophy of de-institutionalisation and normalisation, they are being forced into the community when there are no community services to assist them, and once again it comes back onto the families.

        (a) DEET commenced an intensive internal review of the  management of TAP which has led to the development of the TAP  Management Improvement Strategy (TAPMIS).  The internal review  was necessary because of the high level of deferred payments  carried into 1991/92, a continuing high level of demand for program assistance and problems with the management  information data base. During the review the Department  carried out an overhaul of the program planning, monitoring  and reporting arrangements.
