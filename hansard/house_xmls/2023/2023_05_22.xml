              <span class="HPS-Small">Apex Court of Pakistan Supreme Court SC (Aus Equivalent High Court) made it mandatory for the caretaker governments in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) provinces to hold State elections within 90 days of the dissolution of the assemblies. The caretaker governments and governors in these states are blatantly refusing the electoral processes to be conducted within the time allowed in the Pakistan constitution, in contempt of the orders of the SC. The caretaker governments are allegedly tasked by the ruling elite, to cause serious human rights violations including the assassination of the former Prime Minister Khan, in order to prepare grounds being civil unrest and anarchy, for the postponement of the State elections to an uncertain date. In pursuance of the SC orders, the President of Pakistan provided the election date as 30 April 2023 in Punjab, which is now repealed by the Election commission of Pakistan unconstitutionally and against SC orders to a date in October 2023 anticipating that the current Hon. Chief Justice of SC will retire in September 2023. In KPK the Governor provided a date of 30 May 2023 and later redacted, yet again against the constitution. Parliamentary democracy in the 5th largest country in the world housing over 231 million people is at high risk. </span>

They are reducing or clearing the HECS debt and going to financially support new students while on placement which is definitely a move in the right direction. But what about us, the current students? Those who are passionate about healthcare and struggling to survive, completing a minimum of 800 hours (1600 hours for those completing a double degree) of full time unpaid placement while being expected to maintain our studying. Each semester we are working full time including weekends / night duty and public holidays. Many students cannot afford to even complete placements due to the additional costs of transport, parking (so we don't have to walk kilometres in the dark), the rising cost of living and occasionally accommodation when we are unable to be placed close to our residence. We, students can already identify where the healthcare system is failing nurses and patients. We are compromising not only our own safety with the ridiculous travel commitments and working hours but also the safety of others including our patients. You beg for us to join the workforce, say you need us but we burning out, loosing hope and giving up before we even get there. </span>

I am writing to you because I have serious concerns about the Australian Government's decision to delay the release of the miracle drug, Trikafta, to 6-11 year old Australian children living with CF. In my son, Ralph's, case, gaining access to Trikafta may be a matter of life or death. Ralph's diagnosis is further complicated by Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) and Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD). These disorders significantly impact his ability to focus on the treatment required to manage CF (1.5 hours every morning and another 1.5 hours every night). As you can imagine, this is detrimental to Ralph's quality of life as it severely affects his schooling, social development and confidence. I feel as though I am watching my son's life force and spark for life slowly fading away before my eyes.</span>

This case of Julian Taylor shows this clearly. He came to Australia as a 4 year old, lived here 54 years, holds 4 degrees in Engineering, Accounting, Mathematics and Economics, worked as an engineer and a maths/physics teacher, has an Australian daughter and partner.

Many business visa applicants have made significant investment into Australian businesses and created many employment opportunities for local Australians during their provisional stage. However, after 28/10/2022, the processing time for their Permanent application has been significantly extended up to 35 months, with the Investor Stream does not even have a processing timeframe.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">We urge the Australian government to improve the visa pathway for parents of citizens and permanent residents.

Almost one-third of the population was born overseas, and half have at least one foreign-born parent. They have significantly contributed to the Australian workforce and driven innovation and growth. Allowing parents to stay in Australia longer will benefit their children, grandchildren, and the economy by avoiding expenditure on healthcare, education, and other services.</span>

Separation from loved ones can cause depression, anxiety, and stress, decreasing productivity and increasing healthcare costs. Improving the visa system for parents is crucial for the well-being of Australian families and the economy.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The push for the Voice in regards to the Aboriginal community has been admirable, but it's time to also acknowledge the vulnerability and torment of the transexual and transgender community who are arguably more oppressed and vilified by those with the inclination to do so. The trans community desperately needs a Voice, especially when you consider their significant issues with suicide and exposure to extreme bigotry which dwarfs all other oppressed groups within Australia. One only has to consider how amplified the bigotry experienced by being a transexual as an Aboriginal, for example, to realise the desperate need for a transexual/transgender Voice to Parliament. If you were to count the extended LGBTQ+ community, this encompasses a significant percentage of the population who encounter discrimination and sexuality based hatred on a daily basis. Unlike Aboriginal people, the LGBTQ+ community also suffer consistent alienation and abuse from their own families. It would be wrong to give one oppressed community a Voice without also then offering the transgender community a Voice to Parliament in the same fashion.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">A job's viability and pay rate are important determinants of whether a candidate applies for and accepts a position. In many job adverts, neither the rate of pay nor the compensation package is specified. 61% and 67% of respondents to studies conducted by LinkedIn and Glassdoor, respectively, indicated that compensation was the most essential aspect of a job description. There is a rising global push to make salary transparency not merely the new standard but also the law, according to a BBC article. In accordance with current regulations regarding pay secrecy, job advertisements, flexible work and fixed-term contracts, and gender equality, job advertisements must include the rate of pay or total compensation. I also believe it is misleading for advertisements to include superannuation in hourly, weekly, or annual rates. Retirement benefits should not be included in the compensation package or pay rate. Not including the rate of pay or remuneration in a job advertisement makes it very difficult for prospective employees to make informed decisions and decide whether they will go through the (at times) excruciating process of applying for jobs, which can include phone interviews, zoom interviews, assessments, group assessments, psychometric testing, and in-person interviews, only to find out that the job is not viable.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to consider amending the Fair Work Act to mandate that remuneration be published in job advertisements and that superannuation must be listed separately rather than being included in the rate of pay.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Establishing codes of conduct for parliamentarians and staff was a key recommendation of made by the Set the Standard Report. In February 2023, both Houses of Parliament endorsed draft Behaviour Codes for Australian Parliamentarians and for staff employed under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Members of P</span><span style="font-style:italic;">arliament (Staff) Act 1984, </span>as well as Behaviour Standards everyone who works in parliament, pending the establishment of the advisory and enforcement regime.

              <span class="HPS-Small">The draft codes endorsed by Parliament were developed the Joint Standing Committee on Parliamentary Standards (Committee). Both draft codes for parliamentarians and for staff underscore that ensuring Commonwealth parliamentary workplaces meet the highest standards of integrity, dignity, safety and mutual respect is a shared responsibility, and cover respect, diversity, prohibited behaviours (including bullying, harassment, sexual harassment, assault and all forms of discrimination) and complaints under the code (among other things). The development of the codes was informed by public hearings held in September and November 2022, as well as more than 40 submissions to the Committee. The draft codes, Committee's report, and submissions made to the Committee's inquiry are available on the Committee's website (https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Joint/Parliamentary_Standards)</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">One of the key recommendations of the Set the Standard Report also being progressed by the Government is to establish an Independent Parliamentary Standards Commission (IPSC) to investigate alleged breaches of the codes of conduct. The Set the Standard Report recommended that the IPSC should be able to receive complaints, conduct investigations, make recommendations on sanctions and apply some sanctions to parliamentarians where there has been a breach of the codes of conduct.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, the Government has put in place strong codes of conduct for ministers and ministerial staff.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to correspondence of 18 October 2021 to the former Treasurer, enclosing Petition EN2954, with eight signatures, calling for the reintroduction of COVID-19 supplement payments for people on Australian Government income support. This correspondence has now been referred to me as it falls under my responsibilities as the Minister for Emergency Management. I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As referenced by this Petition, a number of Australian Government COVID-19 measures for people on income support ended in March 2021, including the JobKeeper wage subsidy and social security measures such as the Coronavirus Supplement for recipients of the JobSeeker Payment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In reference to this Petition, I note that the Albanese Government continued a number of payments intended to support those affected by COVID-19 isolation requirements, including those on income support.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Crisis Payment for National Health Emergency (COVID-19) was a one-off payment granted to income support recipients in severe financial hardship who, due to COVID-19, were required to isolate or care for a person who was required to isolate. The amount paid was equal to one week of the person's maximum basic rate of income support. The payment commenced on 25 March 2020 and ended on 1 October 2022. Around 1.7 million grants were paid costing around $580 million over the period.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The COVID-19 Disaster Payment was announced on 3 June 2021 and activated in states and territories as lockdowns progressed. It was a lump sum payment for those who had lost work or income as a result of a COVID-19 lockdown. Payments were phased out once a state or territory achieved 80 per cent of the population aged 16 years or older fully vaccinated, then abolished. All jurisdictions have reached the 80 per cent threshold and the payment is no longer available. Over 2.3 million individuals were supported under this payment to a total of over $12.85 billion.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment (PLDP) was announced on 3 August 2020. The PLDP provided a lump sum payment to assist eligible workers when they were unable to attend work due to having to isolate, quarantine or care for someone who had to isolate or quarantine as required by their state or territory government. Following a unanimous decision by the National Cabinet on 30 September 2022 to end mandatory isolation requirements, the PLDP was ended on 14 October 2022. The PLDP supported over two million people to a total of over $2.3 billion.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The High-Risk Settings Pandemic Payment (HRSPP) replaced the PLDP on 15 October 2022, again, based on a unanimous decision by the National Cabinet. The HRSPP provided financial support for casual workers and those without leave entitlements in identified high risk settings, including aged care, disability care, aboriginal healthcare, hospital care and custodial settings. National Cabinet agreed the HRSPP would cease on 31 March 2023. As at 10 April 2023, over 44,000 claims in HRSPP have been paid to a total of over $32 million.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">From 1 April 2023, Aged Care Worker COVID-19 Leave Payment grants are available to support permanent or casual aged care workers for older Australians most at risk of severe illness. The grants help to further protect people living in residential aged care, or those receiving home care packages, by allowing staff who test positive to COVID-19 to stay home while unwell. Providers of Australian Government-funded residential aged care homes and approved home care packages are able to apply for reimbursement for payments made from 1 April 2023, every three months through the Department of Health and Aged Care. Thank you for bringing Petition EN2954 to my attention.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for the referral of petition number EN3036 of 18 October 2022 (originally referred by Mr O'Dowd to then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator the Hon Marise Payne) which calls on the then Government to introduce Magnitsky-style sanctions legislation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition requests that the Government immediately enact a Magnitsky-style Act. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Autonomous Sanctions (Magnitsky-style and Other Thematic Sanctions) Amendment Act 2021 </span>(which amended the <span style="font-style:italic;">Autonomous Sanctions Act </span>2011} was passed by Parliament on 2 December 2021 and commenced on 8 December 2021. Following this, the Government amended the Autonomous Sanctions Regulations 2011 to establish thematic sanctions regimes in relation to serious human rights violations and abuses, serious corruption and significant cyber incidents. The Autonomous Sanctions Amendment {Magnitsky-style and Other Thematic Sanctions) Regulations 2021 commenced on 21 December 2021.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note the petition calls for the enactment of standalone Magnitsky-style legislation. The amendments to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Autonomous Sanctions Act 2011 </span>and Autonomous Sanctions Regulations 2011 introduced Magnitsky-style sanctions into Australia's existing autonomous sanctions framework. Embedding the reforms in our existing autonomous sanctions framework avoided duplication and ensured consistency across sanctions regimes (including in regards to compliance and enforcement mechanisms and human rights safeguards}, making it simpler for businesses and other members of the community to comply with Australian sanctions laws.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I have made three tranches of thematic sanctions listings. The first tranche of sanctions on 13 individuals and two entities were made on 10 December 2022. Those sanctioned included seven Russian individuals involved in the attempted assassination of former opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Also sanctioned were two Iranian entities {Iran's Morality Police and the Basij Resistance Force) and six lraninan individuals, involved in the violent crackdown on protests following the death of Mahsa 'Jina' Amini and the continued oppression of the people of Iran.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The second tranche of sanctions on 16 Iranian individuals and one Iranian entity made on 1 February 2023 also focused on human rights abuses in Iran. Among those sanctioned were the Basij Cooperative Foundation, and senior law enforcement, political and military figures—including those within the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps {IRGC).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I imposed a third tranche of sanctions on a further 14 individuals and targeted financial sanctions on 14 Iranian entities responsible for egregious human rights abuses and violations in Iran. Among those subject to Magnitsky-style human rights sanctions are four members of the Morality Police who were responsible for the arrest, detention and ill- treatment of Mahsa 'Jina' Amini.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Sanctioned targets also include senior law enforcement, political and military figures, including within the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, involved in the violent crackdown on protests following the death of Ms Amini and the continued oppression of the people of Iran.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia also joined partners to impose targeted financial sanctions and travel bans on 13 Iranian individuals and targeted financial sanctions on one entity involved in the production and supply of drones to Russia. Iranian-made drones have been used by Russia to target Ukrainian civilians and civilian infrastructure.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is also currently undertaking a legislative review of Australia's autonomous sanctions framework. The review is an opportunity to consider legislative reforms to further support the operation of autonomous sanctions, informed by public consultation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Importantly, it will consider improvements to the framework to better support the Government's foreign policy objectives, as well as administrative and regulatory efficiencies to ensure sanctions compliance.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 18 October 2021 to former Senator the Hon Zed Seselja, former Minister for International Development and the Pacific, regarding petition EN3223 on accommodation standards for workers in the Seasonal Worker Programme and the Pacific Labour Mobility (PALM) scheme. As this matter falls within my portfolio responsibilities, your correspondence has been referred to me for reply.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is aware of the accommodation challenges facing the PALM Scheme, and the nation as a whole. PALM Approved Employers (AEs) are required under their Deed with the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, to arrange accommodation for PALM workers, in accordance with standards set by the program, and cannot recruit workers without having an approved accommodation plan. In the PALM Scheme, this accommodation must meet minimum program requirements, including for cleanliness, security, comfort, and safety. The Department are consulting on improvements to accommodation settings as part of their consultation for a new Deed and Guidelines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has also established an Accommodation Working Group to develop solutions for PALM accommodation issues. The working group membership includes PALM AEs and industry representatives, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, state and local government representatives, Pacific and community support organisations, and Commonwealth representatives from the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The working group will develop workable solutions to secure an adequate supply of suitable accommodation for PALM Scheme workers. The working group recently held its first meeting, with a forward agenda currently under development to guide future meetings.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">On 31 March 2022, the former Chair of the Standing Committee on Petitions, Mr Ken O'Dowd, referred Petition EN3946 to the f01mer Minister for Regional Communications, Senator the Hon Bridget McKenzie. This petition has been referred to me as this matter now falls under my responsibility as Minister for Communications. I sincerely apologise for the delay in responding. The petition from the previous Parliament was inadvertently marked as not needing a response during the change of government, and I unreservedly apologise for this oversight.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition has requested that the House of Representatives prioritise the delive1y of a reliable mobile phone service to Tarrawingee through a full-size Macrocell mobile phone tower or equivalent technology that provides reliable services to all residents of Tarrawingee and surrounds.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I understand the concerns raised in the petition and the need for regional communities, such as Tarrawingee, to have access to reliable mobile and internet services, particularly during emergencies.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I can advise that under Round 2 of the Regional Connectivity Program (RCP), Tarranwingee was selected as a location to receive a new Telstra macro cell mobile base station.

              <span class="HPS-Small">The RCP project will deliver improved handheld mobile coverage to Tarrawingee and the surrounding area, enabling improved mobile voice, wireless broadband and Internet of Things (IoT) network capability in a currently underserviced area. The project will create opportunities for economic growth in the town and broader Wangaratta Local Government Area, particularly to local Agriculture, Manufacturing and Tourism businesses. Additionally, the project will support better public safety, as well as delivering better access to health and education. It is anticipated the project will be completed in Q4 of 2024.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to increasing connectivity, bridging the digital divide, improving mobile coverage and protecting communities against natural disaster. To this end, the Government has committed $2.2 billion to regional connectivity in the 2022-23 Budget over the next five years. This includes over $1.1 billion of investment in regional areas, under the Government's NBN policy, to provide full-fibre access to more than 660,000 homes and business in the regions currently relying on copper wire.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, the Government has delivered $480 million to upgrade the NBN fixed wireless network by the end of 2024, which is also enabling improvements to NBN Sky Muster satellite services. This upgrade will provide access to higher speeds over an expanded NBN fixed wireless footprint or increased data limits and product inclusions on NBN Sky Muster satellite services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The upgrade will deliver improved services for around one million premises in regional and remote Australia and in peri-urban areas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of the $2.2 billion investment, the Government's Better Connectivity Plan for Regional and Rural Australia (the Plan) commits $656 million in further new measures to regional communications. This includes $400 million dedicated to boosting mobile coverage and resilience, $200 million for place-based connectivity solutions under two new rounds of the Regional Connectivity Program, $30 million for on-farm connectivity, $20 million for an independent audit of mobile coverage to better identify and target blackspots, and a $6 million boost in funding for the Regional Tech Hub, a platform serving as a trusted source of free and independent advice for regional Australians on technology.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing the petitioners' concerns to my attention and I trust this information is of assistance.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 27 September 2022 enclosing Petition EN4088, with 893 signatures, requesting that the Australian Government designate the United Russia Party as a terrorist organisation, ban members of the United Russia Party from entering Australia, freeze their assets in international jurisdictions and nominate the Ukrainian humanitarian aid organisation as a benefactor of such assets transfer.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For an organisation to be listed as a terrorist organisation, the organisation must satisfy the legislative criteria set out in Division 102 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Criminal Code Act 1995 </span>(Criminal Code), namely that the organisation must be either directly or indirectly involved in the doing of a terrorist act, or advocating the doing of a terrorist act. It is the Government's longstanding practice not to comment on whether an organisation is being, or has been, considered for listing.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you know, the Government has strongly condemned Russia's illegal and immoral, full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which remains a gross violation of international law. Australia's objective, along with our partners, is to empower Ukraine to resolve this conflict on its own terms.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For these reasons, the Australian Government has imposed targeted financial sanctions and travel bans on 981 persons and 108 entities, including members of the United Russia Party. Additionally, Australia has committed approximately AUD680 million in assistance to the Ukrainian Government and to Ukrainian people in need of humanitarian assistance. Since 23 February 2022, my Department has granted more than 10,000 visas to Ukrainians, with more :han 5,000 Ukrainians with these visas having since arrived in Australia.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 27 September 2022 regarding Petition EN4090 and 6 February 2023 regarding Petition EN4588 asking the House of Representatives to stop the Digital Identity Legislation and cease attempts to mandate Digital ID via myGov.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Government shares the petitioners' passion for ensuring that Australians have their privacy and security protected.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government's Digital ID system is a simple, safe and secure way for Australians to choose to verify their identity and prove who they are online.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Digital ID program has been underway since 2015 and is available to use today with over 10 million Australians already choosing to create a Digital ID through myGovlD.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These Digital IDs are being used along with over 1.5 million Australian businesses to access over 125 government services online. Digital ID improves access to services (particularly in remote areas) because it lets people apply for things like Tax File Numbers or Centrelink services entirely online, without travelling sometimes very long distances to a government shopfront.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Digital ID provides an optional way for people to access services without repeatedly providing their identity documents. This reduces the amount of data held by organisations on people using Digital ID, meaning that their data is safer from being hacked.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Digital ID system (the System) follows a 'privacy by design' approach, with strong privacy and consumer protections. This includes security features which undergo rigorous assessment and testing.·</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Providers within the System must be accredited under the Trusted Digital Identity Framework and meet strict requirements to protect users' privacy and security, and control against fraud.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This is important to safeguard the system with high privacy, consumer and governance standards and ensure the trust and confidence of Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the petitioners point out, I also understand that even with these protections in place, not everyone would want a Digital ID. It is important that Australians understand Digital ID is not mandatory. It is completely voluntary and based on consent.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australians can keep using government services the same way they do now—whether that's online, on the phone or in person at a government shopfront.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Government is committed to the success of Digital ID and the protections it offers to access government services online in a secure way, including safeguarding the data and personal information of Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I will continue to consult with the community on these important reforms, and I thank you for bringing these petitions to my attention. I trust that this response provides the signatories assurance in the Government's Digital ID Program.</span>
            </p>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government's approach to repatriations is driven by national security and safety considerations.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 28 November 2022 enclosing Petition EN4547, with 8,599 signatures, requesting that the Australian Government designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organisation under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Criminal Code Act 1995 </span>(Criminal Code).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For an organisation to be listed as a terrorist organisation, the organisation must satisfy the legislative criteria as set out in Division 102 of the Criminal Code. As an organ of a nation state, the IRGC is not the kind of entity that is covered by the terrorist organisation provisions in the Criminal Code.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you know, the Australian Government has strongly condemned the ongoing deadly and disproportionate attacks against protesters in Iran, following the tragic death of Mahsa (Jina) Amini. The Government regularly raises Iran's significant discrimination against women and human rights violations in both Tehran and Canberra, as well as in multilateral fora. Australia has a longstanding bilateral relationship with Iran, which allows us to have frank discussions with the Iranian Government.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This includes members of the IRGC. These sanctions encompass financial sanctions and travel bans on individuals, and financial sanctions on entities. Sanctions are one of the measures the Government employs to respond to human rights abuses and violations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has also worked with partners to remove Iran from the Commission for the Status of Women and co-sponsored and advocated for the successful Human Rights Council resolution for the establishment of an independent fact-finding mission to investigate human rights violations in Iran.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN4551 on make diesel cheaper than unleaded petrol. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In response to your request to make diesel cheaper than unleaded petrol, the Government is not currently considering a reduction in the fuel excise rate on diesel. The Government uses the revenue from the fuel excise collected from diesel to fund essential services that all Australians benefit from such as health, education, and defence.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The price of diesel in Australia has three main components: the international price of refined diesel, Australian Government taxes, and other costs of transporting and selling fuel (including a profit margin.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia currently has among the lowest retail diesel prices among all the OECD group of countries. However, the use of diesel in passenger cars both globally and in Australia is growing. While diesel is used as a motor vehicle fuel, it is also used in a number of industries including mining, rail and road transport, electricity generation and agriculture. The same supply and demand pressures have not generally occurred for petrol.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In its recent report, the ACCC has found that the key factors affecting diesel prices are reduced supplies of diesel from Russia, refinery strikes from France, combined with increased demand for heating in the northern hemisphere winter. Its most recent report can be found at: www.accc.gov.au/media-release/international-factors-kept-diesel-prices-siqnificantly-higher-than-petrol-prices.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you know, the Government has strongly condemned Russia's illegal and immoral, full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which remains a gross violation of international law. Australia's objective, along with our partners, is to empower Ukraine to resolve this conflict on its own terms.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For these reasons, the Government has imposed targeted financial sanctions and travel bans on 981 persons and 108 entities, including senior members of the Russian Government. Additionally, Australia has committed approximately AUD680 million in assistance to the Ukrainian Government and to Ukrainian people in need of humanitarian assistance. Since 23 February 2022, the Department of Home Affairs has granted more than 10,000 visas to Ukrainians, with more than 5,000 Ukrainians with these visas having since arrived in Australia.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Consistent with the Government's election commitment, foreign investment fees doubled from 29 July 2022. Such fees apply to all foreign investors (including temporary residents) under the definition provided in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975, </span>regardless of their visa type or location in Australia.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Foreign investment fees are an essential part of the foreign investment framework and support the cost of its administration. This helps to maintain community support for foreign investment in Australia, particular1y in the housing market.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The National Integrity Framework consists of a suite of policies developed in consultation with sports and other key stakeholders, relating to all integrity areas in sport, including Child Safeguarding. The Policies are currently under review, and we are seeking feedback from sports to ensure they are effective and fit-for-purpose across the sector.</span>
            </p>

              <span class="HPS-Small">While the remit of Sport Integrity Australia does not encompass addressing historical abuse in the sporting sector, the agency has identified the need to provide an avenue for those who have lived experience of abuse in sport, to share their story and be heard.

These referrals could include statutory agencies, such as law enforcement and child protection.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Historically, there have been barriers to sporting participants coming forward with their stories, for fear of victimisation or not being believed. Sport Integrity Australia now provides the safety and function, as well as education and awareness, for those with lived experience of abuse in sport to come forward and be heard.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN4636 on the diversity of Australian owned products within the food and grocery sector. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the Government notes the concerns raised in the petition, it does not have current plans to require food retailers and wholesalers to prominently display Australian owned products or provide special consideration for shelf space positions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Country of Origin Food Labelling Information Standard 2016 (Food Labelling Standard) requires most foods offered for retail sale to have information on the country where the food was grown, produced or made. Australian consumers can choose to buy Australian owned products by checking the label.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Food and Grocery Code of Conduct (the Code) exists to regulate the commercial dealings of retailers and wholesalers with their suppliers to ensure a minimum standard of conduct in the food retail industry. The Code does not seek to intervene in the commercial decisions of retailers or wholesalers regulated by the Code. The broad effectiveness of the Code is scheduled for review later this year.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government notes that any interventions in the commercial dealings of retailers and wholesalers need to balance a range of factors, including potential impacts on transparency, competition, and the cost of living for Australian consumers.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 6 March 2023 regarding petition EN4652 requesting consideration of more flexible for small rural aged care services such as the Allambi Elderly Peoples Home in Dimboola.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Ensuring that, wherever possible, aged care facilities have a registered nurse (RN) on site 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (24/7) by July 2023, is a key component of the Australian Government's plan to improve aged care.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This policy was a direct recommendation of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety (Royal Commission). The Royal Commission identified staffing levels (particularly RN staffing levels) are vital to the quality of residential care that older Australians receive and recommended a minimum care time responsibility (initially set at 200 minutes per resident per day) and a requirement to have an RN on-site and on duty 24/7 be introduced.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note that in line with the request of petition EN4652 there is some flexibility regarding the 24/7 RN responsibility for small rural and remote facilities such as the Allambi Elderly Peoples Home. As was announced in the October 2023 Budget, exemptions to the 24/7 RN responsibility are available to facilities in Modified Monash Model (MMM) 5-7 areas of 30 or less operation places that are able to demonstrate that they have appropriate alternative clinical arrangements in place for the times an RN is not on-site and on duty.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These exemption criteria are in place until 1 July 2024. The Department of Health and Aged Care is undertaking work to explore the feasibility of developing a model of aged care RN workforce shortages by region, and clinically appropriate alternative models of care to ensure safe and quality care is delivered when an RN is not available. This work, combined with information collected through providers' monthly 24/7 RN reporting, may be used to inform future exemption policy decisions and arrangements from 1 July 2024.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to this the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission (Commission) has indicated that in instances where providers cannot maintain an adequate number of sufficiently skilled staff due to external workforce challenges, it is expected they will have deployed strategies (including alternative clinical care arrangements) to ensure the care needs, and particularly the clinical care needs, of residents are met at all times.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">When engaging with a provider about their compliance with workforce-related responsibilities, including the 24/7 RN requirement, the Commission will consider the circumstances of the specific residential facility, and the steps the provider has taken to fulfil its responsibilities. This will include consideration of the efforts made to recruit and retain RN staff, and the clinical governance and alternative clinical care arrangements in place at a facility to ensure the clinical care needs of care recipients are met.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Where a provider demonstrates they are actively working to comply with their responsibilities, the regulatory response will be different from the action taken if a provider is unable to demonstrate a suitable response or deliberately avoids its obligations and may be placing consumers at risk of harm.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Commission will be releasing further information on their regulatory approach to workforce responsibilities, including the 24/7 RN responsibility shortly.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence regarding Petition EN4677 seeking to substitute the Pre- Employment Structured Clinical Interview (PESCI) and supervision for the Australian Medical Council's (AMC's) clinical examination as a pathway to general registration for international medical graduates {IMGs). I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Medical Board of Australia (MBA) is responsible for the regulation of the medical profession in Australia, including determining the requirements for registration. The MBA is an independent body established by complementary legislation enacted in each state and territory and neither I nor the Australian Government is able to intervene in its regulatory processes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The MBA contracts the AMC to deliver certain functions, including the assessment of IMGs, on its behalf. The AMC's clinical exam is one of two pathways available the IMG's seeking general registration on the MBA's standard pathway may use. IMGs may also seek to participate in a Workplace Based Assessment.·</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The aim of the AMC clinical exam is to assess an IMG's knowledge and skills to determine if they are equivalent to an Australian trained doctor. IMGs from all medical specialties are required to complete the AMC clinical exam to be granted general registration. The PESCI serves a different purpose. It is a structured interview designed to determine if a proposed employment offer (including support and supervision elements) is suitable for a</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The PESCI was developed to address the unique challenges presented in primary care and ensures IMGs can safely service the local community as they progress on their journey to become a specialist general practitioner. The PESCI and the AMC clinical exam are both distinct, critical assessment functions within the registration process and cannot be substituted.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the Government is unable to intervene in specific regulatory processes, there is currently work underway to identify opportunities to ease the workforce pressures faced by the Australian heath system.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In 2022 Australian Health Ministers established a Health Workforce Taskforce that will, in part, be responsible for developing and overseeing the implementation of a suite of short, medium, and long-term strategies that will ensure a sufficient and sustainable health workforce is in place to meet the healthcare needs of Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is working closely with state and territory governments and the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency on several measures to streamline and accelerate skills and qualification recognition while maintaining an appropriate level of safety and quality with the aim to improve the timeliness of registration processes that will help overseas trained health practitioners come to work in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, National Cabinet has commissioned an independent review of the regulatory settings relating to health practitioner registration and qualification recognition for overseas trained health professionals and international students who have studied in Australia. The review is currently underway and is being led by Ms Robyn Kurk AO. A report will be delivered to National Cabinet in July 2023.

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 6 March 2023, in relation to Petition EN4680 on early childhood education and care (ECEC) providers charging fees when children are absent due to illness.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government understands the cost-of-living pressures families are facing, and has committed to reducing the cost of ECEC to support working families to get ahead. That is why from July 2023, the Government will increase the Child Care Subsidy (CCS) rate for around 96 per cent of Australian families using ECEC earning less than $530,000—around 1.2 million families.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the CCS when a child is absent from a session of care they would normally attend, their family can get CCS for up to 42 days per child per financial year (52 days in 2022-23, due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic). These absences can be taken for any reason, including when children are sick, without the need for families to provide documentation. Where families have used all their standard absences, they may be able to access additional absences for a reason defined in the Family Assistance Law and where evidence is provided.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the Government plays an important role in assisting families with the cost of ECEC, fee charging practices are commercial decisions made by ECEC providers and are not prescribed under the Family Assistance Law. However, the Department of Education closely monitors ECEC fees to ensure the Government's investments are passed on to families. Further, the Government has directed the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to hold an inquiry into ECEC prices. The ACCC will deliver its interim report to the Government by 30 June 2023 and a final report by 31 December 2023.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has also tasked the Productivity Commission to undertake a comprehensive inquiry into Australia's ECEC system. The inquiry will make recommendations to support affordable, accessible, equitable and high-quality ECEC, with the final report provided to the Government by 30 June 2024.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman,</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 6 March enclosing a petition (EN4681) regarding the question of Palestinian statehood.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Government's approach is guided by the principle of advancing the cause of peace and progress toward a just and enduring two-state solution. We believe the conflict is a matter that must be resolved through negotiations between the parties, and that viewing the conflict from just one perspective will not achieve peace and any lasting solution to the Middle East conflict cannot be at the expense of either Palestinians or Israelis.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Government is taking steps consistent with these overarching principles. We have reaffirmed Australia's previous longstanding and bipartisan position that Jerusalem is a final status issue that should be resolved through peace negotiations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In recognition of the vital work the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) undertakes, the Albanese Government has doubled its funding to the organisation from $10 million to $20 million this financial year. UNRWA is the only organisation that has the mandate and central role to provide relief and social services to Palestinian refugees in the region. We will continue Australia's long-term support of UNRWA until there is a just and sustainable solution to the refugee situation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are also rebalancing Australia's position in international forums. The Albanese Government has shifted five votes related to Israel and the Palestinian Territories in the UN General Assembly's main committees, including on the operations of UNRWA, Palestinian refugees' properties, Israeli settlements, and the right of the Palestinian people to self- determination.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia does not support unilateral actions that reduce the prospects for peace, inflame tensions and prevent Israelis and Palestinians from the full enjoyment of their fundamental human rights, a view the Australian Government expressed at the Human Rights Council on 6 March.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Settlements are an obstacle to peace. At Senate Estimates on 16 February 2022, I associated Australia with the joint statement made by the Foreign Ministers of France, Germany, Italy, the United States, and the United Kingdom on the Israeli government's announcement that it is advancing nearly 10,000 settlement units and intends to begin a process to normalise nine outposts previously deemed illegal under Israeli law.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Government's approach is guided by the principle of advancing the cause of peace and progress toward a just and enduring two-state solution.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence and ongoing interest in the matter. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 6 March 2023 regarding petition number EN4688.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to supporting effective COVID-19 testing to limit the spread and ensure that those most at risk of severe disease, including people with complex underlying health conditions and the immunocompromised, have fast access to care and treatments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Access to COVID-19 PCR tests funded under the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) has not changed throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. A request (referral) from a medical or nurse practitioner has always been a requirement for MBS funded COVID-19 tests (like all other MBS funded pathology tests). A request for a pathology test, including a COVID-19 test, can be made through a telehealth consultation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A clinician cannot get authority to issue a prescription for antivirals without a result. In order to expedite treatment with antivirals, a telehealth consultation is an alternative approach to ensure that the patient can provide a positive rapid antigen test (RAT) and receive the appropriate prescription without delay. If the treating practitioner determines an in-person consultation and_ traditional pathology test is necessary, a written request for the associated pathology service must be provided.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">During the pandemic, COVID-19 PCR testing without the need for a request has been conducted by states and territories. The National Partnership on COVID-19 Response has provided states and territories with funding for PCR testing on a 50:50 cost shared basis. This Partnership ceased on 31 December 2022. In accordance with the testing strategy outlined in the National COVID-19 Health Management Plan (National Plan) for 2023, from 1 January 2023, the new National Partnership for Priority Populations for Testing and Vaccination provides funding to states and territories on a 50:50 cost-shared basis to target PCR testing to those most at risk of severe COVID-19 and death, including the</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">-immunocompromised. Under both the previous and the new National Partnership arrangements, people do not need a referral to access a PCR test through a state and territory testing clinic.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In recent months some state and territory governments have wound "back these COVID-19 testing sites and have prioritised free PCR testing for vulnerable persons who are at risk for severe COVID-19 disease and who are eligible for access to antiviral treatments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The National Plan outlines the current Government health supports to manage COVID-19 over 2023. The National Plan reflects a consistent approach across Australia, agreed by National Cabinet on 30 September 2022, to transition the COVID-19 response with a priority to minimise the incidence of death and severe illness, particularly focusing on those most at risk. The National Plan is available to view on the Department of Health and Aged Care's website at www.health.gov.au by searching for 'National COVID-19 Health Management Plan for 2023'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Medicare does not cover medical supplies. For example, Medicare does not fund bandages or medicines. Medicare provides rebates for clinical services provided by medical practitioners such as the COVID-19 PCR diagnostic tests provided by pathologists (who are medical specialist doctors) within an Australian laboratory accredited by the National Association of Testing Authorities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government continues to ensure the availability of RATs for vulnerable groups including Australia's First Nations people and Commonwealth supported residential aged care homes. Since May 2022, the Government has deployed more than 73.2 million RATs from the National Medical Stockpile.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 6 March 2023 enclosing Petition EN4701, with 11 signatures, related to disaster relief funding for the local government area (LGA) of Cabonne in NSW.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">State and territory governments have primary responsibility for responding to disasters and providing immediate assistance to impacted communities. The Australian Government supports the states with the costs of providing relief and recovery assistance to communities through the jointly-funded Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements (DRFA).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the DRFA, jurisdictions determine the type and level of assistance to make available following a disaster. Importantly jurisdictions are not bound by the DRFA, and can make available whatever assistance they deem necessary, regardless of whether it is eligible for cost sharing under the DRFA. This recognises that states and territories are best placed to identify the type and level of assistance to make available following a disaster, in accordance with their responsibility for disaster management.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In recognition of the devastating impacts of the flooding commencing on 4 August 2022 in Southern and Central West NSW and the flooding commencing on 14 September 2022 across NSW, a wide range of assistance has been made available under the DRFA. Cabonne is a declared LGA for both events and accordingly, residents are able to access assistance that has been offered.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The National Quality Framework for Drug and Alcohol Treatment Services (National Quality Framework) was published by the Department of Health and Aged Care on 2 December 2019, following endorsement by all governments through the Ministerial Drug and Alcohol Forum. The National Quality Framework sets a nationally consistent quality benchmark for all providers of drug and alcohol treatment services and includes strong clinical governance requirements and a list of acceptable accreditation standards for drug and alcohol specialist treatment service providers to meet.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">All providers of drug and alcohol treatment services must comply with the National Quality Framework.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 6 March 2023 enclosing Petition EN4711, with six signatures, concerning China's application to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The current priority for CPTPP Parties is to advance the accession process for the United Kingdom. UK accession negotiations reached a significant milestone on 31 March 2023, with the announcement of substantial conclusion. However further work continues to finalise this process. CPTPP members are focused on maintaining a strong accession precedent, which is in all our interests.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">With respect to future accessions, Australia will work with the CPTPP membership to consider applications on a consensus basis, in accordance with the accession guidelines. It is vital that we maintain the high standards of the CPTPP with any acceding economy. An economy that seeks to accede to the CPTPP must demonstrate that it can meet, implement and adhere to the rules and standards of the Agreement and have a demonstrated track record of complying with trade commitments.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As Australia is a signatory to the international drug conventions, the Australian cannabis and cannabis product laws align with the controls outlined by the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Access by the public to medicinal cannabis products is controlled in Australia through a classification process known as 'scheduling'. Medicines and chemicals are classified into schedules in the legislative instrument known as the Poisons Standard according to the level of regulatory control over the availability of the medicine or chemical required to protect public health and safety. Under scheduling, the overwhelming majority of medicinal cannabis products are prescription only medicines, thus requiring prescription by an Australian registered medical practitioner.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While there are two medicinal cannabis products which have received regulatory approval by the TGA, the majority of patient access to medicinal cannabis products in Australia is permitted through the Special Access Scheme (SAS) and Authorised Prescriber (AP) scheme. Access to unapproved products require specific approvals by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and qualified prescribers to determine the clinical appropriateness for prescribing medicinal cannabis products. The TGA will not approve prescription of medicinal cannabis products under unapproved medicines access pathways if there are safety concerns such as if the doses of the products or the nominated patient is inappropriate for the particular product.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To improve transparency and data accessibility, the TGA also publishes on its website de-identified data on SAS approvals and notifications and AP approvals specific to unapproved medicinal cannabis products.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 6 March 2023 regarding petition number EN4716, which proposed changes to sick leave.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Fair Work Act 2009 </span>(the Act) does not specify what type of evidence of personal/carer's leave needs to be given by an employee, only that the evidence must satisfy a reasonable person. Depending on the circumstances, reasonable evidence may include alternatives to a medical certificate from a doctor, such as a leave certificate from a pharmacy or a statutory declaration. Further information about providing evidence for sick leave can be found on the website of the Fair Work Ombudsman: www.fairwork.gov.au/leave/sick-and-carers-leave/paid-sick-and-carers- leave/notice-and-medical-certificates.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">With respect to the request that the annual sick leave entitlement be increased from 10 days to 12 days, nothing in the Act prevents an employer and employees negotiating a workplace agreement that has conditions that go above the safety net established by the National Employment Standards, including for example to provide for greater amounts of sick leave and quicker accrual or crediting of sick leave. Employers and employees can also negotiate about the type of medical evidence required to support sick leave, the frequency with which it is required, and payment for medical examinations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">With respect to the request that sick leave be paid into a collective pool for employees that they can access throughout their career, I can advise that the Australian Government has committed to consulting with state and territory governments, unions and industry to develop, where it is practical, portable entitlement schemes for Australians in insecure work. The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations is currently undertaking planning to progress these consultations which will inform any subsequent policy.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 6 March 2023 regarding petition EN4744, requesting the Australian Government to reverse the $0.50 indexation of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) concessional card co-payment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to easing cost-of-living pressures and ensuring that all Australians are able to access high quality health care, including prescription medicines, through the PBS. The PBS is a key component of Medicare, providing significant direct assistance—$14.7 billion in 2021-22—to make medicines affordable for Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Medicines supplied under the PBS are subject to a patient contribution, known as a co-payment. The co-payment is the amount the patient pays towards the cost of their PBS medicines and assists in its sustainability. While many PBS medicines cost significantly more than the patient contribution, the co-payment for 2023 that applies to Commonwealth concessional entitlement cardholders is $7.30.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under legislation, the amount is automatically indexed on an annual basis, in line with the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The CPI increase for 2023 for the concessional co-payment was $0.50, which equates to an additional $18.00 for full priced prescriptions before the PBS Safety Net threshold is reached, beyond which concessional patients receive free PBS medicines for the balance of the calendar year.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The concessional co-payment remains less than one quarter of the general co-payment amount of $30.00 paid by Australians who do not hold a concession card. Pharmacists also have the option to discount the patient co-payment further by up to $1.00, which means that many concessional patients will pay no more than $6.30 for the cost of a PBS medicine in 2023.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government understands that for some patients and families who need a lot of medicines each year, the cost can be significant. The PBS Safety Net scheme protects patients and their families from incurring excessive costs in relation to the supply of medicines. The concessional safety net threshold in 2023 is $262.80.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government reduced the PBS Safety Net thresholds in 2022 and as an ongoing benefit of this, the concessional safety net amount is now the lowest it has been since 2006.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A concession card holder can reach the PBS Safety Net threshold after 36 prescriptions and become eligible to receive PBS medicines free for the balance of the calendar year (plus any applicable premiums that may apply).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises that there are general patients who are often on low to middle incomes that may not meet the requirements to be a concession cardholder. These general patients were paying a significantly higher price for medicines than concessional patients. That is why on 1 January 2023, for the first time in 75 years, the general patient co-payment was reduced to $30.00, down from $42.50 in 2022.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government does not have any further amendments to the co-payment or PBS Safety Net threshold for concessional or general patients to announce at this time.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 20 March 2023 concerning petition number EN4756 about the revised requirements for the importation of dogs and cats into Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Rabies is a terrible disease; it kills about 60,000 people around the world every year, so it is essential that we keep Australia rabies-free.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has an important role in assessing and managing the biosecurity risks associated with the import of a range of goods from overseas. Regular reviews are undertaken, and risk analyses may be conducted, in response to new information about biosecurity risks, or to an import permit application.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note that the petition includes 2 requests relating to the department's recent review of the rabies virus risk in imported dogs, cats and canine semen from approved countries. Addressing the first request to <span style="font-style:italic;">'Pause the implementation of the revised import requirements for domesticated animal (dog/cats) until such time as the department can prove that they have the mechanisms in place from foreign government to properly and timely support the ide</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ntification of pets', </span>I am able to advise that the department has been engaging with trading partners since the draft review was released in October 2022. This has resulted in bilaterally agreed country specific identity declarations or use of the model certification by countries representing 85 per cent of imports.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The department will continue the implementation and continues working closely with trading partners to ensure the biosecurity risks associated with rabies are managed. Since the last policy review in 2013, there has been growing commercialisation of the companion animal trade.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Many countries, including Australia, have reported increases in fraudulent certification for cat and dog imports.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Addressing the second request to <span style="font-style:italic;">'Recognise all existing P</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ost Entry Quarantine (PEQ) bookings made under the previous incumbent import conditions at the time the import permits were issued, and ... the validity of the RNATT testing window of 24 months, and the incumbent 10 days PEQ stay.for all pets entering Aust</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ralia', </span>I can advise that all existing PEQ bookings remain in place and are not subject to change as a result of the new policy. In addition, the department decided not to vary existing import permits that were valid when the new policy was finalised. This means that individuals who had an approved import permit for a cat or a dog prior to the release of the final policy review may import their animal into Australia subject to the import conditions outlined in their permit, including the acceptance of an RNATT with 24 month validity and requirement of a minimum 10-day post-entry quarantine period.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Transitional arrangements have also been agreed for managing applications submitted prior to 1 March 2023 that had not yet been finalised, providing options for people to import their cats and dogs to Australia whilst balancing the biosecurity risks with the need for fairness and equity.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for raising this matter with me and for the valuable work undertaken by the Committee.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 20 March 2023 regarding petition EN4759 in relation to rail freight electrification.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has set ambitious emission reduction targets for which strong action will be required across all transport modes. Our net zero task for transport will be undertaken in a planned and coordinated way to ensure we can take up economic and productivity opportunities, while carefully managing the transition to new energy sources for our transport sector.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A Net Zero Unit has been established in the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts to identify how the infrastructure portfolio can work across government and with industry to help achieve net zero and improve the resilience of our transport networks and supply chains.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's ambition is to embrace opportunities for sustainable growth in the rail industry, growing jobs, expanding our manufacturing base and delivering a cleaner environment. The National Rail Action Plan (NRAP) outlines a commitment between Australian governments and industry to boost rail safety and productivity. NRAP has three priority areas; addressing skills and labour shortages, harmonising rules and standards across jurisdictions, and advancing interoperability of freight and passenger rail.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Given the rail sector's low relative emission rates, increases in productivity will have flow on sustainability effects as it supports the increased competitiveness of rail.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, under NRAP the Rail Industry Safety and Standards Board has developed national standards for energy storage and emissions from diesel powered passenger trains, with the aim of creating an environmentally cleaner rail industry.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing the petition to my attention. I trust this information will be of assistance to the Committee.</span>

Australia, with France, will also jointly manufacture 155mm NATO-standard ammunition. This assistance makes a meaningful contribution to Ukraine's defence, empowering Ukraine to resolve this conflict on its own terms.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 20 March 2023 regarding petition number EN4775 on banning companies convicted of carrying out illegal gain-of-function research.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note that the petition refers to public comments about Pzifer intentionally mutating viruses in order to develop tailored vaccines. I can reassure you that Australia's framework for the regulation and oversight of life sciences research, including gain-of-function research, is comprehensive. In some areas Australia's regulatory framework is more extensive than in other countries. For example, unlike Canada and the USA, Australia has specific legislation for laboratory-based research with genetically-modified organisms and the Gene Technology Regulator certifies facilities undertaking such research. Australia's approach to health security has also been recognised internationally for its capabilities to prevent, detect and prepare for biosecurity and biosafety risks.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's framework for the regulation and oversight of life sciences research includes a combination of Commonwealth and state/territory legislation, national standards and guidance, as well as local institutional governance and practices. Management of research integrity in Australia relies on a system of self-regulation by research institutions (including universities) within this national framework.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There are additional controls for, and oversight of, research involving infectious agents and research involving genetically modified organisms including requirement for licences, monitoring and reporting to government bodies for.some research. Ethics and safety approvals (including biosafety and biosecurity) from government bodies and/or institutional committees that encompass consideration of the risks and benefits of the research may also apply.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The legislative controls include provisions for action on any contravention of the legislation. The application of this framework to potential gain-of-function research is outlined in Figure 4 on page 23 of the National Health and Medical Research Council's Gain-of-Function Research Review Report (March 2022) available at www.nhmrc.gov.au/about- us/publications/gain-function-research-review-report.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further details on the elements of the framework, relevant legislation and responsible agencies, and institutional controls are provided in Table 5 (starting on page 24 of the report). The relevant figure and table are also attached.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 20 March 2023 on behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions regarding petition number EN4778 to restrict energy drink sales for persons under 16 years of age.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Caffeine is a mild stimulant, and is found in many natural sources, such as tea leaves, coffee beans, and cocoa, but can also be added to processed foods, such as cola drinks, sports supplements and energy drinks.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code (Code) restricts how much caffeine can be added to energy drinks and cola-type soft drinks. Currently, the Code (Standard 2.6.4) specifies that a formulated caffeinated beverage (an energy drink) must contain no more than 320mg/L of total caffeine, from any source. For reference, this concentration is similar to the amount of caffeine in a cup of instant coffee. Standard 2.6.4 also outlines the labelling requirements for energy drinks, this includes the requirement for products to carry a statement to the effect that the food is not recommended for children, pregnant or lactating women and individuals sensitive to caffeine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Code includes labelling requirements for other foods containing added caffeine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Foods containing added caffeine must have a statement on the label that the product contains caffeine. Foods containing guarana (a South American plant with high levels of natural caffeine) must also be labelled as containing caffeine. This is to help people avoid caffeine either for themselves or their children.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There is no recognised health-based guidance, such as an Acceptable Daily Intake level for caffeine. A Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) working group found evidence for increased anxiety levels in children at intakes of about 3 mg of caffeine per kilogram of bodyweight per day. This amount for children aged 9-13 corresponds to a caffeine intake of 120 mg per day (approximately two cans of cola).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While research undertaken by FSANZ has confirmed that caffeine intakes in the general population remain at appropriate levels, it is recognised that the food consumption data used for this dietary intake assessment came from the 2011-12 Australian National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey and may not reflect current consumption patterns.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The next national nutrition survey is currently underway which will inform a new assessments of caffeine intakes in the -population.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">FSANZ is currently reviewing (through Proposal P1056) the permissions for caffeine in sports foods and general foods. This review is considering the risk caffeine poses to sensitive sub-populations such as children. This work includes several public consultation periods, the first of these closed on 13 February 2023.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">FSANZ is currently considering these submissions which will help inform the final regulatory recommendations for caffeine. Any regulatory recommendations, including proposed drafting for the Code, will be provided in the second round of consultation to be released later this year.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 20 March 2023, concerning Petition EN4783 relating to the cancellation of the Cashless Debit Card (CDC) in the Ceduna region.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you are aware, the Australian Government has delivered on their election commitment to abolish the CDC across Australia. This commitment was implemented through the <span style="font-style:italic;">Social</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Security (Administration) Amendment (Repeal of Cashless Debit Card and Other Meas</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ures) Act 2022, </span>which ceased the compulsory CDC in the regions of Ceduna, East Kimberley, Goldfields, and Bundaberg and Hervey Bay region.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The evidence on the CDC program was not conclusive. The last evaluation of the program reported both positive and negative findings, and the Australian National Audit Office found that the program did not demonstrate that it met its objectives.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Since early October 2022, former CDC participants in Ceduna, East Kimberley, Goldfields and Bundaberg and Hervey Bay regions have been able to opt out of the CDC program, or volunteer should they feel this option more appropriate for their circumstances.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 6 March 2023, those who have volunteered and current CDC participants in the Northern Territory and Cape York and Doomadgee region transferred to enhanced Income Management (IM).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Enhanced IM utilises a contemporary card (known as the SmartCard), which preserves the financial functionality that participants are familiar with through the CDC. Under enhanced IM, participants retain their current physical card until they receive their SmartCard. However, IM program rules apply, such as restricting purchases of alcohol, gambling, tobacco products or pornography.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to consulting on the future of the IM program with a wide range of stakeholders, including First Nations leaders, women's groups, service providers, communities, people receiving welfare payments, and state and territory governments on the future of IM across Australia. IM and enhanced IM will remain in place until this consultation is complete.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">During my consultations in the Ceduna region in June 2022, the importance of continuing support services, access to supports for crisis and capacity building, as well as pathways from welfare to employment and economic independence were discussed. As a result of this feedback, on 24 September 2022, I announced the Government will provide up to $17 million for community-led and designed initiatives to support employment opportunities and economic independence in former CDC regions. Successful initiatives will commence from June 2022 and be delivered through to 2024-25, with additional funding and extension of existing support services and the Local Partner program to 30 June 2024.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government, through the Department of Health and Aged Care, will also deliver $49.9 million for additional alcohol and other drug treatment services and support in the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay, Ceduna, East Kimberley and Goldfields regions. These services will be co-designed with the local community to ensure the supports meet local needs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to continue consultations with First Nations communities, affected communities and individuals about what the future of IM looks like for them. Consultations are covering what support is required, as well as co-designing strategies with communities to address long-term challenges including drug and alcohol misuse and problem gambling.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In this regard, my department has developed Local Services Plans to identify service gaps, improve services and address social issues in former CDC locations. My department utilised feedback from consultations with service providers and various stakeholders in the development of these Plans. The Local Services Plans are now available on the department's website at www.dss.gov.au. Further, I have announced funding of $16 million to address the issues identified in these plans. More information on the announcement is available to view at www.ministers.dss.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I will continue working with communities to support services and investment to address concerns about anti-social behaviour or other issues in communities. This includes working with communities about what is the best way forward and what types of intervention could reduce social harms.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for writing. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 20 March 2023 regarding the Sealing Roads in the Dandenong Ranges and Surrounds (Sealing Roads) projects, and providing me with a copy of the petition you presented to the House of Representatives, concerning recent funding reductions to these projects (EN4785).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note the concerns raised by the community around the condition of unsealed roads across the Cardinia Shire and Yarra Ranges and acknowledge the effect these conditions have on residents.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The 2022-23 October Federal Budget both honoured the Australian Government's election commitments and made necessary adjustments to some existing infrastructure projects to ensure the Infrastructure Investment Program (IIP) can be delivered in a sustainable way.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you are aware, the Commonwealth's commitment towards the Sealing Roads project has been reduced with uncommitted funding being returned to the Budget. The Department of Infrastructure, Transp01i, Regional Development, Communications and the Alis is working closely with both Councils to ensure that all works currently under construction or contracted will be delivered.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to investing in infrastructure projects that support Victoria's growing cities and regions, which are underpinned by strong supporting evidence and demonstrated value for money. The Australian Government is working closely with the Victorian Government to ensure the investment in road transport infrastructure is sustainable and does not exacerbate market capacity issues.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

The Petitions Committee is always interested to see the diversity of matters submitted to the House by petitioners. Petitions can relate to a general policy area such as action on climate change or can be more specific, such as the listing of a particular medicine under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. In all cases, petitions must make a request of the House on a matter on which the House has the power to act. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">That this bill be now read a second time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is an affirmation of Australian values—values that respect the equality of Australians from all races, beliefs and backgrounds; the dignity of people with disabilities; the right to freedom of speech; our shared fundamental human dignity that the ideology of Nazism stands against. Nazism today stands against Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, people with disabilities, Jewish Australians, LGBTI Australians and any Australian with a different political view than their own. This bill affirms our values as Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It honours the sacrifices made by Australians made during the Second World War, an entire generation of Australians under the leadership of Robert Menzies, Arthur Fadden, John Curtin and Ben Chifley that stood together to oppose Nazism. Most Australians have a story of an ancestor or ancestors who stood for freedom when it truly mattered. I think of my grandfather, a good man whose ambition was nothing more than to raise a family and run a hardware store. He signed up to defend Australia and stand against Hitler's sick racial ideology and the ideology of imperial Japan. My grandfather paid a terrible price for those convictions, enduring the worst deprivations of the Changi prisoner-of-war camp and the horrific Thai-Burma Railway. Such was the cost for standing against evil. It was a cost paid by nearly 40,000 Australians who made the supreme sacrifice in World War II, as well as a million Australians who served, the families they loved and a generation whose sacrifice was nothing less than complete. With this bill we honour their memory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I had hoped, and the Leader of the Opposition had hoped, when we worked together on drafting this bill, that it could be another affirming moment of our shared commitment to our great Australian values—values of respect, acceptance and good-heartedness and a fierce determination to stand against an ideology of genocide and death. It's the thing we do most days in this parliament. I'm proud of the work I've done with the member for Wentworth and the member for Macnamara, co-chairing the Parliamentary Friends of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance. But sadly on this bill we've had only politics. The government blocked debate on this matter in this House almost two months ago. The government recommended through the Senate committee process that an identical bill be voted down, and the government has offered no alternative bill or process. Despite saying two months ago that the government was working on a bill to this effect, where is this bill today?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the depths of my being I oppose hate speech, racism and anti-Semitism. Because these things are so despicable, we should never throw around accusations about them lightly. It's one of the reasons the Jewish community so strongly opposes casual references to the Holocaust, because you can't be casual about the greatest crime in human history. Yet two months ago the Attorney-General accused the opposition leader, a man who has been our Home Affairs minister and our Minister for Defence, of giving encouragement to neo-Nazis. He accused a man who is not antisemitic of being an antisemite. He accused a party that is not antisemitic of being antisemitic. The Attorney-General should've known better. We were assured then by the Leader of the House, who I believe spoke genuinely, that the government would do something. Instead, two months later we have nothing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is more than an affirmation of who we are, though affirmations like this are sometimes needed. This bill is more than that. This bill will make Australians safer. The director-general of ASIO, Mike Burgess, warned in his latest annual threat assessment about the increase in grievance based violent extremism and an increase in the radicalisation of young Australians. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As a nation, we need to reflect on why some teenagers are hanging Nazi flags and portraits of the Christchurch killer on their bedroom walls, and why others are sharing beheading videos. And just as importantly, we must reflect on what we can do about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ASIO backed these words up with a submission to the Senate committee on this bill. They said the Criminal Code Amendment (Prohibition of Nazi Symbols) Bill would assist law enforcement in early intervention. Let me read from the committee's report:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) explained that Nazi symbols play a significant role among nationalist and racist violent extremist groups, both by signalling ideology and in-group belonging, as well as provoking or intimidating ideological opponents. ASIO further explained that symbols are:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… an effective propaganda tool because they are easy to remember and understand. They can transcend language, cultural, and ethnic divides; creating, distributing, and understanding them is not limited to a select few or one cultural or language group.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report also noted that ASIO contended that symbols served to promote cohesion among some nationalist and racist extremist groups, and provoke their opponents:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Nationalist and Racist Violent Extremists adopt specific imagery and terminology to signal their ideology, build in-group belonging between adherents, and provoke or intimidate ideological opponents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ASIO made it very clear in its submission to the committee:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">ASIO is aware that nationalist and racist groups use hate speech and extremist insignia in their recruitment and profile raising. Globally, there can be links between hate speech and hate motivated crimes, including terrorism. The possession of extremist material has featured in many prosecutions of terrorist offences. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Symbols matter. The Sydney Jewish Museum, quoting British novelist Dion Fortune, made the observation:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">"Symbols are to the mind what tools are to the hand". We must deny these extremists access to such symbols—symbols they use to create fear, spread hate and capture new recruits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Don't think that this is not happening here, right now. Our country is dealing with this today. Look at the front page of this week's <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Jewish News</span>, where small groups of radicals, not the mainstream in any way, are seeking to conflate the work that I, Mark Liebler and other prominent Jewish Australians have done on the Voice with their anti-Semitic tropes. These small evil groups will seek to exploit our legitimate debate we have on any issue when they see an opening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe this bill has a part to play in our work to keep all Australians safe. Let me turn to what this bill will do. This bill introduces an amendment to the criminal code relating to the prohibition of Nazi symbols. This bill does not make the display of Nazi symbols and the use of explicit Nazi actions, such as the Nazi salute, illegal. A Nazi symbol is a symbol or action commonly associated with the Nazi party and would include the Nazi swastika, Nazi salute, Nazi uniforms, and other types of symbols identified in the ECAJ anti-Semitism report. It would be an offence to display such a symbol without reasonable excuse. The penalty is 100 penalty units or 12 months in imprisonment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To avoid doubt, the display of a swastika in connection to Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism does not constitute the display of a Nazi symbol. It should be noted that, in the same way the Nazis looted the belongings of millions, they also misappropriated the legitimate symbols from these faiths. Nothing we seek to do is about perpetuating this misappropriation. And to ensure this prohibition doesn't interfere with the vital work of teaching young people about the evils of the past, there are limitations and carve-outs in terms of genuine educational, scientific and artistic purposes such as films and documentaries, and it doesn't apply to journalism or where symbols are displayed for another purpose in the public interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to recognise the work undertaken by state governments already. In 2022, New South Wales unanimously passed the Crimes Amendment (Prohibition on Display of Nazi Symbols) Act 2022. In Victoria, the Summary Offences Amendment (Nazi Symbol Prohibition) Act 2022 makes it an offence to intentionally display in public the Nazi swastika. I note that Tasmania is examining how a ban on Nazi salutes can be incorporated into the Police Offences Amendment (Nazi Symbol Prohibition) Bill 2023 before that parliament. I also recognise that Queensland and South Australia have foreshadowed protections against the display of Nazi symbols.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no moral ambiguity when it comes to Nazi displays, demonstrations and actions. This bill will ensure there will be no legal ambiguity when it comes to Nazi displays, demonstrations and actions either. Nazism is not just another political viewpoint; it's an evil, an evil whose fundamental tenet is the racial superiority of one group of people over another. Churchill called the ideology of Nazism 'the perverted science'. But it was not a myth without consequence. Six million Jews were murdered, a figure that represented two-thirds of the Jewish population of Europe in its name. It also resulted in the murder of 1.6 million Polish citizens, 5.7 million Soviet citizens, three million Soviet prisoners of war, 312,000 Serbs, 220,000 Roma, 250,000 people with intellectual disabilities living in institutions, 70,000 so-called 'asocial', 1,900 Jehovah's Witnesses, and thousands and thousands of homosexuals and political prisoners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was industrial-scale murder the likes of which the world has never seen. It was an ideology of hate that experimented on children, buried people alive, and set furnaces ablaze with the bodies of millions of men, women and children. Every one of them had a name. Every one of them was loved. Every one of them carried within them the essence of human dignity. Every one of them had dreams and aspirations which, in their totality, could brighten the night sky. I have met Holocaust survivors who have withstood unimaginable night terrors and witnessed the unimaginable. I honour them all and those who fought against Hitler and his crimes. I believe there is broad community and political support for this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Citizenship is a moral responsibility; it's a call to participate, to play our part and do our duty not only to our country, but to each other. In March, when we first sought to have this bill debated, I spoke of Katie Popp, a German Australian Catholic who, in a moment of choosing, saved my family in the 1930s. Katie's decision not to turn a blind eye, not to be a bystander because of the risk to herself but to risk all for what is right, is an example that lives through time. It's an example that her generation has left to us. That is what this bill is all about, and I commend the bill to this House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">That this bill be now read a second time.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister is 'annoyed.'</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition leader has 'had enough.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's all very well. How about doing something about it then?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition did have nine years, but finally the major parties are listening after years of advocacy from crossbench members for Clark, Mayo, and more recently the member for Curtin and myself and others. Communities want gambling advertising around sport to STOP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And I mean, stop dead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A recent three-year study from La Trobe University for the Victorian Responsible Gambling Foundation found that 78 per cent of the 50,000 respondents felt they should be able to watch TV sport with no gambling ads, 87 per cent said teenagers are exposed to too much gambling advertising.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have two of those teenagers, and it's for them, and others in our communities across Australia, that I speak today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is why I am introducing this bill. It is a direct reflection of community sentiment and I thank all of those from within my community of Goldstein and from around the country who have contacted me in support of this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill would place an outright ban on gambling advertising on our screens; including broadcast television, pay TV and their respective streaming services, and on radio.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will be followed by the findings of the House of Reps committee inquiry into online gambling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope that this bill, together with the inquiry's forthcoming recommendations under the formidable leadership of the member for Dunkley, can put an end to gambling ads on TV, on radio and online.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The online space is a complex web of algorithms that targets people based on their age, demographic and browsing habits, with gambling ads specifically geared at teenaged boys and young men, but increasingly attempting to draw in young women as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recent moves by platforms like TikTok to adopt subtle gambling promotions to target young people must be dealt with by the government after the inquiry reports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to broadcast, like big tobacco, the gambling industry, making millions off the young, the poor and the desperate in our communities, will resist.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But with gambling ads at saturation levels and invading the minds of our young people in ever more insidious ways, to the extent that multis are now of more interest than the games themselves, we must act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The gambling ad spend in Australia rose from $89.7 million annually in 2011 to $287.2 million in 2021—a 320 per cent increase and grew further to $310 million by last year. TV ads accounted for more than half of the spend, with about 346,000 television ads on free to air alone; that's an average of 948 per day or 39.5 per hour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Aware of the latest crossbench push on this, the opposition has recently suggested banning gambling ads during sporting events and one hour either side. The evidence shows that this will not fix the problem. In fact, recent policy interventions to restrict the timing and proximity of gambling ads around broadcast sport has only pushed gambling into other programming—including programming that appeals to children like comedy shows and Marvel movies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Communications and Media Authority has itself concluded that an effect of restricting gambling ads during live sport after rule changes came into effect in 2018-19 was simply an increase in gambling ads during non-sport programs—especially between six and 10.30 pm when children and teenagers are watching.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only that; the total volume of gambling spots increased by no less than 50 per cent between 2016-17, before the rule changes, and 2018-19 once the new regulations came into effect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Research from Deakin University in 2018 found that young people are highly aware of gambling marketing. 'When we have dinner,' one said, 'the TV is usually on and usually between the news and stuff they do have ads like Sportsbet.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When asked what should be done about gambling, young people across multiple studies have called on governments and sporting organisations to take greater responsibility for protecting young people from gambling marketing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In one study, three quarters of young people agreed that sporting codes should do more to prevent young people from being exposed to advertising for gambling on sport.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are failing these children if we do not act. I have had youth football officials in my electorate of Goldstein tell me directly that they know the boys in their junior teams are actively betting on gambling apps on their phones.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also know this is happening because I hear my teenaged son and his friends talking about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We cannot say we didn't know. And we cannot hide from the community concern about this. I have had an avalanche of positive reaction from across the country to this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The conclusion is obvious: nothing short of a complete ban on gambling advertising will work and meet the increasing concerns of parents and sports fans alike.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill seeks to replicate the approach taken to banning tobacco advertising in 1976.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After all, gambling is also a public health issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The social cost of gambling in Victoria alone has been estimated at $7 billion a year. Family and relationship problems were the highest cost, followed by emotional and psychological issues, including distress, depression, suicide and violence. Financial harms were only the third-highest cost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can change this—after all it hasn't always been this way. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amazingly, considering how pervasive it is now, sports betting (other than horse racing) wasn't legal in Australia until 1983, via the TAB, and non-government sports betting—such as Sportsbet—wasn't legal until 1993.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, just 30 years later, Australians are the biggest gambling losers worldwide.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of this has happened well inside my own lifetime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1983 I was a schoolgirl living in Perth where my father—a former 100-gamer for Essendon in the VFL—was coaching Subiaco in the WAFL.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I had grown up around football in Tasmania, where my father coached North Launceston to eight straight grand finals, winning five.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of my weeknights as a kid were spent eating curried sausages made by the female volunteers, including the legendary Yvonne Morton, in the clubrooms while Dad was training, my weekends sitting on the bonnet of the car on the boundary at what was then York Park, now UTAS Stadium, jumping off to toot the horn when the red and black kicked a goal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a different time to be sure. And we can't turn back the clock to the days when football was about community, not business and money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we can remind ourselves that sport is about fun, health, participation and people and its net benefit to society should be positive. That's why we must end gambling ads, and properly tax the gambling industry's betting profits to offset potential revenue loss to sport.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand the argument that gambling ads underpin modern sport's economics in Australia—but that's an addiction that as a society we must break.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because the price we are paying is a generation of young sport lovers who think they aren't part of the gang if they don't bet, who know more about the intricacies of 'multis' than they do about the finer points of the game they are watching.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The price we are paying is in the evidence—that 18-to-24-year-old men are the fastest-growing cohort of problem gamblers; the first cohort to have been exposed to saturation gambling ads as kids.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's no longer time to hold 'em. It's time to fold 'em. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend this bill to the House, and I strongly urge the government to listen to the community concern and to recognise the concern across this chamber and to allow this bill to be debated.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I acknowledge the first anniversary of the election of the Albanese Labor government. We've spent the first 12 months of this government cleaning up the mess we inherited and working hard to deliver stronger foundations for a better future for all Australians. Twelve months ago Australia turned away from the coalition's mess and mismanagement and instead chose a government with a positive plan to grow the economy, create new jobs, boost renewable energy and invest in skills and training. It was also on this day that I was elected to represent my local community as the member for Cunningham. Every day since I have been proud to be a member of this Labor government, which governs for all Australians, not just its mates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is much more to do. Australia faces many challenges, and our government has been upfront in discussing those with the public. Meanwhile the government has used its first year to address many of these challenges by—and this is a very long list—reviving Medicare and making medicines cheaper; making child care more affordable; acting to reduce carbon emissions and make energy cheaper; driving the transformation to renewable power; funding 20,000 new university places, as well as 180,000 fee-free TAFE places; having a 15 per cent pay rise for workers in the aged-care sector; establishing the $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund to ensure that Australia is a country that makes things; taking the sting out of energy prices and ensuring bill relief of up to $500 for eligible families and $650 for small businesses; supporting an increase in the minimum wage; allocating over $16 billion in renewable energy infrastructure through Rewiring the Nation; investing $200 million in 400 community batteries across the country, including in Warrawong in my electorate; strengthening our international relationships; and restoring the federal budget. Each of those initiatives points to a better future for Australia, and all were needed after nearly 10 lost years of coalition government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Illawarra community and economy will benefit from our government's initiatives. Of particular importance to me is the way in which the Illawarra will benefit from the Albanese government's determination to rebuild and grow Australia's manufacturing base. Alongside growing sectors of our local economy, such as services, education, tourism and renewables, our manufacturers have a strong future. That future is based on recognised strengths in steel, mining and heavy industry, combined with our deepwater port, great education and training facilities, skilled workers, and large and small businesses. All of these attributes are also feeding our thriving renewable energy industry, whether that be battery technology, green and cheap hydrogen production or planning for offshore wind. In the Illawarra we have firms like Sicona Battery Technologies, Green Gravity, EcoJoule and Hysata all working to make the Illawarra a renewable energy powerhouse. At the national level is Labor's $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund, which will drive economic development in our regions and outer suburbs, boost our sovereign capability, diversify the economy and help create secure jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During its first year, the Albanese government has invested in the Illawarra to ensure we have the right skills to support future sustainable local economic growth. The University of Wollongong has received funding for 936 new places to train more teachers, nurses and engineers, as well as $10 million for its Energy Futures Skills Centre. Wollongong TAFE has received $2.5 million for its Renewable Energy Training facility. We all know that renewable energy has a major role in our futures. That is why the federal government has invested in local hydrogen related projects, such as $9 million to support Hysata to develop new facilities to deliver low-cost hydrogen in Port Kembla, and $800,000 for an ATCO Australia feasibility study on hydrogen technologies and storage. And let's not forget the $1.6 billion energy savings plan for households and businesses to access energy upgrades to improve their energy use and save on costs, which includes specific support for social housing. In Cunningham we are lucky to have great Australians like Saul Griffith and his amazing Rewiring Australia team working on the ground in our community and with government to make electrification a reality regardless of income or postcode.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The election of the Albanese Labor government one year ago was a turning point for Australia, a turning point towards a positive community and a sustainable economic future.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAMILTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:31</span>):  It gives me no pleasure to rise in response to this motion, which I assume is part 2 of the previous statement from the government about how it's been a good 10 months. I remember that when that statement was made I asked, 'For who?' A good 12 months? I'll ask again, 'For who?' This is a great self-congratulatory motion moved by Labor for Labor on Labor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I don't think the people of Australia are going to be too keen to be listening in to this particular one about how great things are going. Certainly not in my patch, where we have great charities like Protea Place and Hope Horizons that, for the first time ever, have had to cancel fundraising functions because there's a lack of tickets able to be sold. There's just not enough money in the economy floating around. Places like Base Services, that do such a good job helping homeless people into jobs, have got the largest demand they've ever had, and at the same time they're getting the least community support because the economy isn't there to support them. We've seen recently that business insolvency across the nation has doubled across the last 12 months. It has not been a great 12 months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This speech deserves some interrogation because it's not just self-congratulatory and it's not just tone deaf; it is misleading to talk about what the economy was that this government inherited. The lowest unemployment rate in 50 years. Welfare dependency at its lowest levels in 30 years. Tax rates for small businesses were at the lowest rate in 50 years. Eleven million Australians had reduced taxes across that term of government, in which two million new jobs were created. That's to put some facts on the table there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at what we have here. 'Responsible cost-of-living relief' is the description for this budget. There is $185 billion of additional spending. No, you don't get to use the word 'responsible'. That's a stimulus budget; that's what that is. That's fuel on the fire; that's what that budget is. Cost-of-living relief? Not if you're a double income household trying to get ahead. A young couple buying a house, getting a mortgage and putting kids through school—this is not a good package for you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Part (3)(b), that this budget creates more opportunities for Australia, is completely misleading. The budget confirms 175,000 Australians will lose their jobs. That's not opportunity. That is opportunity being stripped from Australians. Let's be really clear about what this budget does say and what this budget does for Australia. It reduces opportunities for Australians—175,000 jobs taken away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Part (3)(c) states that this budget builds a more secure economy into the future. Goodness me! When we have seen the instant impact of price caps stripping away investment in the gas sector, at a time when we have an energy price crisis, the insecurity this brings to Australia's future energy supply cannot be described in enough detail. I do not have enough time left to go into this, but the price caps we've seen confirmed in this budget will have the same impact that price caps have had on every economy they've been imposed on. They will drive up prices. That is what they have always done and that is what they will always do. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous speaker talked about being upfront. Let's go through the broken promises we've seen for the last good 12 months. Cuts to your electricity bill by $275? No, that's broken. Cheaper mortgages? No, that's broken. There are no changes to super or lower inflation. There'll be no industry-wide bargaining: 'It's not part of our policy.' There are three promises, all broken. The promise that every aged-care home would have a nurse onsite at all times by July this year? No. These are broken promises. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The idea that this government has been upfront across the last 12 months—we saw recently a great example of what we have seen for the last 12 months. We've had a Treasurer caught out by the ABC—of all people—for deliberately misleading Australians on the size of the debt. You know it's bad when even the ABC don't trust Labor. That's a pretty bad state of affairs. You've lost your base there, guys. This is the government we have. As much as it troubles me to take away the glorious backslapping and self-congratulatory indulgence and that slight whiff of hubris about this motion, it has not been a great 12 months for the people of Australia. It has been a very difficult time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've been listening. We are out there, on the ground, listening to what Australians are saying. And they are not supportive of this sort of motion. </span>

The room was awash with red and with celebration. As I looked around, I saw many happy, familiar faces who had helped join the campaign to win the seat of Pearce in Western Australia. I had become the first Labor candidate to win the seat of Pearce since its creation in 1990. As I held my hands aloft I felt relieved, I felt excited and I felt a deep sense of pride that I was to become the federal member for Pearce and a member of the Albanese Labor government. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">A large swing towards Labor carried across Western Australia in a sign that change was well overdue. The Western Australian and Australian community had voted and said, 'It's time for Labor to govern for the people again.' I recall the election night like it was yesterday, and as we mark one year in government I am proud to say that the Albanese Labor government has not wasted a day since being elected. We have spent the first 12 months working very hard to deliver stronger foundations for a better future for all Australians. Led by a prime minister of strength, integrity and heart, our government puts Australians first. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have passed more than 80 bills, bills that provide real cost-of-living relief for Australian families, bills that shape a better future because that is what Australians deserve. We are strengthening Medicare and saving Australians time and money at the Australian pharmacy with the introduction of 60-day dispensing. We have made medicines and access to GPs and health care cheaper by tripling the bulk-billing incentive for GPs that will benefit millions of Australians. We have already made medicines cheaper under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. For the first time in 75 years the maximum cost of general scripts has gone down. The maximum general co-payment has been reduced from $42.50 to $30 since 1 January. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal budget 2023-24 is responsible, practical and carefully collaborated to alleviate inflationary pressures. Under the 2023 budget we are expanding access to financial support by raising the age cut-off for the parenting payment single from eight to 14 years. We have legislated cheaper child care that starts in July this year. We are getting wages moving again, with pay rises for millions of Australians. We are giving a record 15 per cent pay rise to aged-care workers across Australia and restoring dignity in aged care. We are supporting businesses by introducing a new instant asset write-off to support small businesses. Around 90,000 small businesses in Western Australia that meet the definition of an electricity small customer will receive quarterly bill relief of $640 automatically from 1 July 2023. We are investing $1.6 billion in Australian businesses and households, including social housing to empower them to take control of energy use. This will ensure homes and businesses are cheaper to run and more comfortable. We are protecting our precious environment and threatened species. The Albanese Labor government will legislate a national net zero authority to ensure the workers, industries and communities that have powered Australia for generations can seize the opportunities of Australia's net zero transformation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our 2023 budget helps restore Australia's economy from the mess we inherited from the coalition, who left us with a debt of $1 trillion under the Liberal National Party. Those opposite also left Australia with an economy defined by a decade of stagnant wages, flatlining productivity, weak business investment, skills shortages and energy policy chaos. In contrast, in a memorable and productive year, the Albanese Labor government has made robust progress, passing legislation that puts Australian families and the economy at the forefront of decision-making. We know there is much more to do. We have made a good start and we know that to deliver long-lasting positive change we have to continue our focus and our hard work, and we are absolutely committed to doing so.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:41</span>):  Thank you for the opportunity to speak. I do not agree with the premise that is being put to the parliament. I feel sorry for the children up in the public gallery because they're the ones who are ultimately going to pay for Labor's reckless debt and reckless policies. The member for Pearce mentioned $1 trillion worth of debt. Labor should stop misleading the House. The ABC fact checked this, and it is nowhere near $1 trillion worth of debt. So the Labor dirt unit should take that out of their talking points forthwith because it is actually misleading the parliament of Australia, and to continue to say it is an absolute lie. It is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Pearce asked what we did when we were in government. Well, during the pandemic, we saved potentially 60,000 lives with the policies and the actions that we took, and 1.1 million jobs were created at the same time. Indeed 700,000 jobs were saved through JobKeeper. Those opposite wanted to pay people to get a jab. The debt would have been even higher had those opposite been listened to. Since Labor came to office—and it has been 12 sorry months—power prices have increased. That is a fact. Interest rates have increased. That is a fact. Unemployment has increased. That is a fact. The cost of living has increased. That is a fact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm glad that the minister for regional development is sitting opposite because she might try to explain, as the member for Cunningham, who moved this motion, ought to as well, to their regional electorates—or the periurban parts of their electorate, in the member for Cunningham's instance—why there is no new money in the budget for the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program, and why the Stronger Communities Program has just been stripped, taken away, removed from those hardworking volunteer organisations which look to that money, which relied on that money, which otherwise, in some instances, could not continue to operate but for the assistance under that very successful program which was first put in place after lobbying by the member for Parkes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More than that, when you look at the Mobile Black Spot Program in New South Wales—those opposite go on about colour coded spreadsheets. I see the member for Eden-Monaro nodding. Well, Labor has colour coded spreadsheets too. The trouble is they're all red, for Labor, because under that recent program announcement, which was called, and was part of, the Mobile Black Spot Program funding, every single allocation, for every single mobile phone tower—you know what?—went to a Labor electorate. How is that fair? I know that, when the member for Eden-Monaro was elected—and good on her; I stood beside her at some press conferences before, indeed, she even ran as the member, when she was a mayor, and a good mayor, I will admit—and came into parliament, she absolutely complained about the funding that didn't go to her electorate, which was beset by fires. I acknowledge the fact that she worked hard for her community. But how can she and other members of the ALP justify every single Mobile Black Spot Program funding grant going to a Labor electorate? It's not fair. It's not right. It cannot be justified in any way, shape or form.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we talk about Mobile Black Spot Program funding being part of the national emergency plan, and it is. How is it that the National Emergency Management Agency staff have been cut from the regions? How is this so when, if you believe those opposite, the next disaster is just around the corner? We live in Australia, and that's probably right. Luckily, there haven't been any fires of the magnitude that happened during that Black Summer of bushfires. I appreciate that last year the floods were terrible and the Lismore situation was particularly disastrous. But then you get members opposite who take away funding from flood infrastructure—and by 'flood infrastructure' I mean increasing the Wyangala Dam wall just by 10 metres. Yes, it's a big ask, but what do we get from Labor? Well, we get, from the state water minister, 'Well, we're going to just make better escape routes for the people of Forbes.' How insulting! And there is no funding for dams or water infrastructure from those opposite.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:47</span>):  Yesterday marked one year of an Albanese Labor government. We promised the Australian people that after a wasted decade we wouldn't waste a single day, and we haven't. It's been a year of hard work, determination and dedication towards fulfilling the promises we made. Our focus has been on providing stability, confidence and security, delivering the positive, lasting change that Australians voted for. I'm proud of what we've achieved so far. We know there's still more to do, but we've laid solid foundations now to build a better future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the first 12 months, we've made essential services more affordable for every Australian by making child care and medicines cheaper, ensuring that families can access the support they need. Additionally, we have provided 180,000 fee-free TAFE places, empowering individuals with skills for a prosperous future. We've also delivered 20,000 new university places, including 967 at the University of Newcastle, rapidly expanding opportunities for students in higher education. Recognising the invaluable contributions of our aged-care workers, we have funded a well-deserved 15 per cent pay rise for them. Our commitment to combating family and domestic violence is evident through record investment in women's safety and the introduction of 10 days paid domestic violence leave, providing support for survivors to rebuild their lives. We have made substantial progress in advancing a Voice to Parliament, which will empower First Nations people, address injustices and create change that will deliver a better future. Foreign minister Penny Wong's extensive diplomatic efforts, visiting 32 countries including all Pacific Islands Forum members, demonstrate our commitment to restoring international relations. To ensure a transparent and accountable government, we have successfully delivered a National Anti-Corruption Commission, which will begin operations on 1 July. Additionally, we have implemented measures to promote fair wages and conditions, such as 'same job, same pay', minimum work standards for gig workers, and criminalising wage theft.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our unwavering commitment to addressing climate change and fostering sustainable energy practices is reflected in $16 billion of investment in renewable energy infrastructure. We have passed the safeguard mechanism to reduce emissions from major emitters and initiated the New Energy Apprenticeships program, providing financial support for individuals pursuing careers in renewable energy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also achieved a lot for our environment. We've committed to protecting 30 per cent of our land and 30 per cent of our oceans by 2030. We've legislated a path to net zero. We've approved double the number of renewable energy projects. We've set a target of zero for new extinctions. We're cleaning up and restoring our urban rivers and waterways. And we're doubling our funding to national parks. We've also started rewriting Australia's environmental laws with our Nature Positive Plan, including establishing an Australian Environment Protection Agency. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recognising the importance of a strong manufacturing sector, we've established the $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund, supporting local industries and promoting a vibrant economy. We're also developing a new Australian Cyber Security Strategy to protect our nation from cyber threats and secure our digital infrastructure. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Newcastle, we've committed $100 million to a renewable energy precinct at the port of Newcastle and a further $82 million for green hydrogen. We're reopening the GP Access After Hours clinic at the Calvary Mater Hospital next week, and we have kept the Kaden Centre's doors open so they can continue their innovative exercise oncology program. High-speed rail is back on track. Funding is flowing to the University of Newcastle for a New Energy Skills Hub, and our local schools are finally getting the funding they need for important projects. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These accomplishments are testament to the Albanese Labor government's commitment to serving the Australian people and delivering the positive, lasting change the Australian people voted for. We're 12 months in. There is more to be done. But we are not taking this opportunity to build a better future for granted. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:51</span>):  In the last few weeks I've had a little bit more time to watch children's movies with my kids, like <span style="font-style:italic;">Finding </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Nemo</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Jungle Book 2</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Lightyear</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Puss in Boots</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Super Mario</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Bros. Movie</span>. My repertoire of children's movies is expanding fast. But in watching those films I've seen no greater fiction, no greater flight of fancy, than the motion from those opposite. In the Australian vernacular, they're simply dreaming. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me state for the record the unmistakable fact. One year ago, the coalition government left this country in good shape. Despite having faced the greatest financial challenge in almost a century, with the global pandemic, the greatest geopolitical shift since the end of the Cold War and global pressure on energy costs and supply chains, Australia was in a strong position to meet the challenges of this decade. At the end of the coalition government, we left our successors with a country more strong and more resilient than when we inherited it, with almost two million new jobs created, youth unemployment halved from 16 per cent to 8.3 per cent, taxes heading down and a legislated plan for tax cuts that will end the scourge of bracket creep.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We provided the lowest small business tax rates in 50 years; a $120 billion infrastructure pipeline; trade deals with the UK, India and ASEAN; record numbers of apprentices in training; a plan for net zero emissions by 2050 through technology, not taxes; record investments in Medicare, hospitals, schools and aged care; and 2,900 new and amended medicine listings on the PBS from 2013. We started the most significant rebuild of Australia's defences in our lifetime. We strengthened the agreements and partnerships needed to keep Australia strong, whether it was AUKUS, the Quad, Five Eyes or our partnership with ASEAN.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion claims the Albanese government is providing cost-of-living relief and a plan for the future. It's fiction. It's the same old Labor tactic: if you're failing, claim you're succeeding. If you're increasing taxes, claim you're providing cost-of-living support. If the public don't know what you're doing, just assert you have a plan. This is a budget without a plan—no plan to reduce expenditure, no plan for inflation, no plan for productivity. This is a budget built on bracket creep and sneakily taking more tax from Australians after they get their inflation recovery pay rise. This is a budget that will give a tax hike to 10 million Australians who earn under $126,000. It's a budget with a new tax on truckies, new franking credits and super taxes that hit retirees and pensioners. It's a budget that, based on its own estimates, increases unemployment by 175,000. It's a budget that is spending $185 billion more and fuelling Labor's inflation fire. It's a budget that ignores what's happening in communities around Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I chose to go to the back bench last month I went to railway stations, shopping strips and shopping centres and spoke to mums, dads and small-business owners. Our shops are being hit with electricity and gas price increases and declining trade. Consumers are being very cautious around discretionary expenditure. Butchers told me about increasing power bills and fewer customers buying less red meat and choosing less expensive cuts. Chemists told me that customers are getting their prescriptions and that's it. The homewares shop owner showed me her bank statement with $125 in it. She said she was only hanging on for Mother's Day. I went away from those shopping centres and community catch-ups realising there is one economic certainty this year, and that is that shops will close. Households are hurting, but it's small businesses and their employees that are suffering. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through it all Labor has not kept its promises. Electricity bills are going up by $500 in this budget, despite the Prime Minister promising 97 times to cut power bills by $275. Labor promises power bills will be $1,200 a year in 2024-25. Based on forecasts in the budget, they'll now be higher—at $2,000. The Prime Minister said that, if you make a promise and commitment, you have to stick to it. He promised cheaper mortgages, lower inflation, no industrywide bargaining and no change to super—promises discarded by the Treasurer with a PhD in politics. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My greatest concern is that the government has no plan to tackle inflation. Inflation is a cancer to the economic health of families. Inflation hurts the purchasing power of singles, families and retirees. Inflation corrodes savings, particularly those saving for a house or retirement. It eats away at retirement savings. Inflation is the economic hamster wheel speeding up. More and more is required simply to keep up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition spoke of a new working poor. I don't want to see Australians heading down the American path where mums and dads work harder and harder in more jobs and longer hours and still don't get ahead, where homeownership slips more and more out of sight, and where families live in fear of big, unexpected rent increases.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget is a failure. It's a budget built on bracket creep and on the deficits and red ink of Australian families.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(2) calls on the Government to lift people out of poverty by raising JobSeeker above the poverty line, wiping student debt, and taking urgent action to address the housing and rental crisis.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear constantly from the government that this budget was about making hard choices and about showing restraint, but that narrative is not universal—it does not apply to everyone. This budget applies the rule and expectation of restraint and hard choices to working people but an entirely different set of rules and expectations to the mega wealthy and multinational corporations. When working- and middle-class Australians ask for the government to have their back, the government immediately employs the narrative of restraint, which is completely disconnected from the reality that people are facing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government tells us that it can't lift JobSeeker or youth allowance above the poverty line to $88 a day because it needs to tackle inflation and it has to be fiscally responsible, but the reality is that inflation is being driven by price gouging and corporate profiteering, and not by the incomes of workers and the lowest-paid people in our country. The reality is that 69 per cent of additional inflation in Australia has been caused by excess corporate profits, while labour costs account for just 18 per cent. The reality is that people across this country are struggling to put food on the table or a safe roof over the heads of their children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government acknowledges that, yes, there is a housing crisis and, yes, most people on income support are spending more than 80 per cent of their payments on rent, but the most this government can do is propose a measly $8 a week increase in Commonwealth rent assistance. The reality is that in my electorate of Brisbane 53.5 per cent of people rent their homes, and rents have increased by 23.5 per cent in the past 12 months alone. When the average rent has increased by $135 a week in my electorate, $8 per week won't even cover six per cent of that increase. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With this budget the government tells us that the student debt system works perfectly fine and that there are no issues with the fact that student debts will be indexed at 7.1 per cent this year, which equates to an increase of about $2,840 on a HECS debt of $40,000. The reality is that this government will reap more money from increasing the debt burden of thousands of students this year than it will from taxing the profits of oil and gas companies. In this budget, the government tells us that they must curb the growth of the NDIS. The reality is that too many disabled people are not able to get the support they need to live a good life. The reality is that this government is more willing to hand over $41 billion of subsidies to the fossil fuel industry and $9,000 in tax cuts for the wealthy this year than it is to support those in our country who most need it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has made it clear with this budget that they are uninterested in standing up for the needs of the average Australian. I hear constantly from people out there in the community that our economic system is broken—that it is not functioning for the benefit of working people but rather is being rigged in favour of those with the wealth and power to buy favourable policy outcomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is a better way forward. Three hundred and sixty-six days ago, our campaign in Brisbane made history. We fought the election on a platform that offered transformative change to that broken system and to put power back in the hands of people. We can create a better future for all of us, and we should not just accept the crumbs that we are being offered. This starts with banning corporate donations and ending fossil fuel subsidies, and taxing the superprofits of banks, the mining sector and the energy giants that are rorting us, to pay for the things that benefit us all: getting dental and mental health into Medicare; raising JobSeeker, youth allowance and the age pension to $88 per day; directly investing in building public and genuinely affordable housing; and making all education truly free—no debts, no fears. All of these would make a meaningful difference to the lives and livelihoods of people across my electorate, but more so, as well, to the entire country. We will fight every day in this place for transformative change. When we win, we fight for you.</span>

                  <a href="DZY" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:01</span>):  The cost of living certainly is a very serious issue. We, as a Labor government, hit the ground running, and we're committed to the promises that we made, to ensure that we lift that burden of the cost of living. You would have seen actions in this last Albanese Labor government budget by the Treasurer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government understands that the rising cost of living is having a serious impact on Australian lives. Australians elected us, as a government, to take responsibility, to listen to their voices and to deliver. And that's exactly what we're doing. That's why we delivered, in the budget that was announced a couple of weeks ago, $14.6 billion towards the cost of living—$14.6 billion to help people and to ease the burden of the cost of living. This package was in the 2023-24 budget two-and-a-bit weeks ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The largest area of government spending in the budget is social security and welfare, and the reason for that is to assist those people who are doing it toughest. More than one-third—that's 36.6 per cent—of the government's spending is support for the aged, families with children, people with disabilities, veterans, carers and the unemployed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And, I'm pleased to say, it does not stop there. We're delivering cheaper child care. We're delivering cheaper medicines. We're expanding paid parental leave. And we're building more affordable homes—including through the National Housing Accord, which people in this place should support. We're increasing the minimum rate of Commonwealth rent assistance by 15 per cent; it's the biggest increase in over three decades—the biggest increase in 30 years. And we're increasing the base rate for eligible recipients of JobSeeker, Austudy, youth allowance and other working-age payments. These are all levers that have been put into the budget to assist people. We're also providing electricity bill rebates to more than five million households and one million small businesses, in partnership with state and territory governments. We're tripling the bulk-billing incentives to support 11.6 million eligible Australians, including children, pensioners and other concession card holders, to access a GP with no out-of-pocket cost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw a government for 10 years neglect all these areas. We're acting. We're acting fast and we're doing it methodically, in a way that will assist people and, at the same time, not hurt the economy. We're not wasting any more opportunities with confused priorities, as we've seen in the last decade through the former coalition government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Addressing the cost of living is more than just putting money in people's pockets. It's about sustainability and responsibility. It's also about responsibly enforcing policies and mechanisms to strengthen and ease the pressure, not just for today but also for tomorrow. It's not just momentarily but well into the future. This budget was the foundation for exactly that. This is what we promised and this is what we have delivered. That is why this Albanese government will continue to work towards a better Australia for every Australian, to ensure that no-one is left behind, delivering on the promises that we made in the pre-election commitments and to ensure that we ease that burden of cost of living. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The energy price release plan, up to $3 billion of electricity bill relief through the Energy Bill Relief Fund, is to take pressure off households and small businesses. In partnership with the state and territory governments, this will benefit more than five million people across eligible households and one million eligible small businesses. Retail electricity price increases in 2023-24, because of the direct impact of the policies of the Albanese government, are expected to be around 25 percentage points lower, and retail gas price increases around 16 percentage points smaller than expected prior to the government's energy interventions. This government is also making it easier for households and small businesses to access energy saving and upgrades through financing options for households and new tax breaks for small and medium-sized businesses. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">JobSeeker has been an issue for a long time. We know that people on JobStart find it hard to live on it. That's why there is $4.9 billion to increase the base rate of several working aged student incomes—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:07</span>):  We all know that the biggest pressure on the cost of living right now is housing. This requires urgent practical action. But how much direct funding has the Labor government committed to tackle this housing crisis? Precisely zero. They found plenty of direct money for the stage 3 tax cuts, for submarines—almost a trillion dollars—yet no direct funding for the housing crisis. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not a novel or radical idea for governments to directly fund and provide public housing. All over the world today there are housing commissions and housing bodies building significant numbers of quality, well-designed houses to meet the needs of their communities. We've had successful housing programs too, right here in Australia, in the past. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's a little history lesson. During and post-World War II, Australia was in the midst of a terrible housing crisis. Construction had slowed due to the diversion of materials and labour to the war effort. In that case, the Australian government, a Labor government at the time, wanted to tackle the scale of the housing crisis, so they established the Commonwealth Housing Commission in 1943 in the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement in 1945. That was an agreement with the states to establish and operate public housing funded by the Commonwealth through cheap loans. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Housing Commission promoted housing as a right for all Australians and had a very clear directive—that it provide as many homes as possible for as many people as possible in the shortest time possible. And it worked. At the peak of this public housing bill, in the late sixties, around 80,000 homes were built over a five-year period. That's when the population was half of what it is right now. So, in today's terms, the Commonwealth contribution to these homes was $8 billion. That's almost four times what this government is proposing today, if the fund makes any money at all. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Central to the workability of the traditional model of public housing—in operation all over the world and still existing, to a degree, in some schemes here in Australia—is government ownership of those houses. They're public assets. They generate a return in the form of rent, set at 25 per cent of the tenant's income, and accrue value in and of themselves. They quite literally pay for themselves over time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the many irrational elements of Labor's proposed Housing Australia Future Fund is the complex and contorted arrangement to subsidise the private market and private providers through the private for-profit system. The government has no equity in these homes, so not only does the bill not stack up in terms of the scale and the urgency of the housing crisis we are currently experiencing, it doesn't stack up in a financial sense for the government. What could possibly be the reason for this government's reluctance to simply build public homes and retain them as public assets for years to come? One explanation could be that it might stop house prices and rents from climbing at the absurd rate that they have been for so many years now. This slowing down of the housing market is exactly what we do need to tackle the crisis, but it could put a real dent in the bottom lines of the big banks and the property developers who fill the government's coffers come election time. When it comes to building publicly owned nuclear submarines Labor can easily find half a trillion dollars of direct investment. But, on the other hand, when it comes to building publicly owned, genuine, affordable homes for people who need them Labor cannot find a cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Call me old-fashioned, but when people are sleeping in cars and tents across the country, when we have a shortfall of 640,000 affordable homes, when thousands of people are at risk of eviction because their rent has spiked, I really feel that the government should just build houses, not gamble money on the market and possibly use the returns to subsidise private providers to maybe deliver some slightly less expensive housing for a small number of people. Just build houses. Just build beautifully designed, sustainable, affordable public homes for everyone who needs them. We've done it before in this country. The government should just build houses.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians were hopeful that the 2023 budget would deliver much-needed support in difficult economic conditions. Following a year of rampant inflation, a record number of consecutive interest rate rises and an ever-increasing cost of living, Australian families, small-business owners and retirees were hoping that the government would address the day-to-day living pressures they faced. This was an opportunity to ease the burden that was exacerbated by Labor's first budget, in October last year, when they did nothing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, on 9 May hardworking Australian families—our vital middle class—were left bitterly disappointed. This budget utterly failed on multiple fronts. If you're a first home buyer saving whatever you can to secure a home, this budget does nothing to help you reach that goal. If you're a renter, this budget does nothing to address the increasing cost pressures that are increasing your weekly rents. If you're a small-business owner, this budget does nothing to ease the rapidly rising cost of doing business, and equally, this budget does nothing to address the issue of finding staff for your business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget is clearly not a budget that is fair to all Australians. Instead, it reinforces the mistakes made in Labor's first budget, making it clear they have no plan to help Australians with the cost-of-living crisis. They have shown little fiscal restraint, with spending to increase by $185 billion, which will just place further pressure on Australian families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following so much build-up and hope, unsurprisingly Australians received a typical big-spending, big-taxing Labor budget. It confirmed that, under Labor, there will be no growth in real wages this year. The cost of living will continue to rise. Gas and electricity bills will continue to rise. As to unemployment, in a time when businesses across my electorate are struggling to find staff, the budget papers say that unemployment is going to rise. That is extraordinary. Inflation will remain stubbornly high, and Australians will continue to face higher taxes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fiscal pressures will continue to pile on from there. Despite the Prime Minister promising Australians some 97 times during the election campaign that he would reduce your power bill by $275, even their Energy Price Relief Plan for your electricity bills shows that they will continue to rise, and not by a small margin either. Electricity bills will go up by almost $500 through the time frame of this budget, and I know that in Queensland they're going to rise by some 20 per cent from 1 July. It's a far cry from a reduction of $275. All of these costs will continue to rise, and the consequence for everyday Australians is that their money will buy less each and every day. This budget has no plan to bring down inflation, which is impacting all Australians. We see through this budget that the Labor government have removed their priority to fight inflation at a time when inflation has been above seven per cent for three consecutive quarters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was in stark contrast to the coalition's last budget, where we cut the fuel excise in half; delivered a one-off $250 cost-of-living payment to six million Australians; introduced the low- and middle-income tax offset; helped to make the dream of homeownership a reality through HomeBuilder, the First Home Super Saver scheme and the Home Guarantee Scheme; and removed the cap on the instant asset write-off for small business. It's a coalition government that has shown the way forward. Much as those opposite deride our time in government, I'm proud of our record and the support we have provided over successive years to make our economy one of the strongest in the world, a foundation which those opposite can now build on but an opportunity which they haven't taken advantage of. I commend this motion to the House. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GOSLING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:17</span>):  Deputy Speaker Freelander, it is fantastic to see you this beautiful Monday morning in our nation's capital. I know those opposite are in opposition and they haven't got much to crow about. We're trying to fix up the state in which they left our national economy, and I'm immensely proud of the budget that we handed down on 9 May, which is delivering responsible cost-of-living relief for Australians and in particular for Australian families, who are doing it tough. Taking pressure off those families is our top priority.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget provides cost-of-living relief that is affordable. It prioritises those who are most in need, including by providing energy bill relief to over five million households and one million small businesses. I'll be speaking upstairs later on on the small business support, but that's huge for small business. It also helps 170,000 households save on energy bills by financing energy-saving home upgrades. The budget cuts the cost of medicines by up to half for at least six million Australians. It supports 57,000 single parents around our nation by expanding eligibility for the single parenting payment. That's huge support for those who need that support from our government, and we're giving it to them. It responsibly increases the base rate for eligible recipients of JobSeeker and other payments—1.1 million Australians. It increases the Commonwealth rent assistance for 1.1 million households. It encourages investment in more housing, including tax breaks to boost investment in build-to-rent projects. It delivers a 15 per cent pay rise on award wages for aged-care workers. It's getting wages moving again across the board. That, again, helps families to balance their own budgets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We promised the Australian people that, after a wasted decade by those opposite, we would get on with the job of taking pressure off household budgets, and I'm proud to say that this is exactly what this budget does. I note that the honourable member opposite's motion lectures the government about the need to balance the budget. That's exactly what it did, strengthening our fiscal position, with a budget surplus now forecast in 2022-23; and delivering lower deficits and debt compared to recent budgets. Labor is on track to deliver the first surplus in 15 years. Those opposite had nine years in office to achieve this. Those opposite talk a big game when it comes to fiscal management, which is supposed to be one of their supposed strengths, but not once did they achieve in nine long years what this government has already achieved in its first year in office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also proud that in this budget we're strengthening Medicare, which is the foundation of Australia's primary healthcare system. The budget invests an historic $5.7 billion to strengthen Medicare. It makes it cheaper and easier to see a doctor, by tripling bulk-billing incentives, with immediate benefits for more than 11 million Australians. That is huge. It funds more medical urgent care clinics, including in my electorate up in Darwin and Palmerston, and after-hours primary care. This will see immediate benefits for many Territorians. When we improve primary health care for Australians we'll see fewer Australians getting into acute care and needing to be hospitalised. The budget also invests $17.3 million in the current financial year and $17.7 million in 2023-24 to maintain the National Critical Care and Trauma Response Centre, at the Royal Darwin Hospital and the Darwin International Airport, to make sure it's in a state of readiness to respond to major health incidents in Australia and the region. The NCCTRC is something that we can all be incredibly proud of. I'm proud that our government continues to back its important work. We're also providing $9.8 million for increased quarantine capacity at the Centre for National Resilience in Howard Springs, which kept the nation safe during the pandemic. This is a great budget.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:22</span>):  We've heard it all before: no changes to superannuation, no changes to franking credits, no changes to unrealised gains, no changes to capital gains, no changes to negative gearing—no changes to tax. That is not what happened. We saw now Prime Minister Anthony Albanese make commitments like this in the election campaign, and the people of Australia have been misled. Why is it so? Because this government wants to spend $185 billion in additional expenditure over the forwards in the most recent budget. That $185 billion has to be paid for.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As much as I'm reluctant to quote Campbell Newman, the former Premier of Queensland, I will on this one. He said just last week, 'We see the RBA have their foot on the brake when it comes to the economy and inflation.' They want inflation down, as we all do. We want interest rates under control, as we all do. But this government, this Treasurer and this Prime Minister have their foot on the accelerator, and you can't have both. You cannot have both. With inflation running at seven per cent, the cost of living is completely out of control. We saw reports in the media just this morning. The humble loaf of bread—not the executive loaf; not the fancy loaf, Deputy Speaker Freelander, and I'm sure you're a humble-loaf-of-bread individual—</span>

                  </a>  It's up between 50 and 70 per cent. The humble loaf of bread is the basis of what many Australians feed their kids with. The price has gone up because inflation is out of control, and this government is adding fuel to the fire.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we want to see is simpler and fairer taxes, not higher ones. We want to see the government control their expenditure, and we want to see that monetary and fiscal policy actually lines up. But what have we seen? We see two new board members for the RBA, and what's their background? ACTU. I'm not sure what that adds in terms of monetary policy, but I don't know that it's all that strong. We will continue to see these types of changes from this government because they simply cannot help themselves. They are not interested in what those hardworking taxpayers are doing out there. They are the ones that are getting it in the neck. I don't care whether you call them middle Australia or anyone else; it is every individual that is out there working hard, paying taxes that has to pay for the largesse of this federal government. In my electorate alone the loss of the low-income tax offset has impacted 51,000 people. That is an enormous number of individuals.</span>

                  </a>  I hear the interjections. We actually kept paying it because they needed the money, and they need the money right now. They need it right now because their power bills are up, their gas bills are up, their mortgages are up, their interest rates are up. They simply can't pay the fundamentals of what it costs to live in this country, because they don't have enough disposable income. Yet this government wants to take more. They want to take more.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we go back to what happens with me locally, we put out a survey, Hinkler's biggest survey. Eighty-six per cent of respondents were worried about changes on their superannuation savings and the taxation that might affect them. As I have said, 51,000 have lost up to $1,500 in the low-income tax offset. Guess what? The 2021 census says the median weekly income in my electorate is $576. If a loaf of bread is up by 70 per cent, that's a big chunk of your $576. Eighty-eight per cent of respondents to the survey are under pressure on their budget. Eighty-five per cent want affordable and reliable electricity, and 73 per cent, would you believe, are supportive of new nuclear energy, just as an aside. But we have so many people right now who can't pay their rent, can't pay their bills and can't buy the basics, just food.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what do we see from this Labor government? We see an acceleration of expenditure, $185 billion in the most recent budget. We will look to see what the RBA does at the next interest rate change. They are struggling with their mortgages, those who have them, if they can find a home. What is the proposed solution from those opposite? They're going to bring in another 1.5 million people to this country, 400,000 in just one year. Where will they live? Right now the average construction rate in this country is around 200,000 homes a year. Sometimes it's lower; sometimes it's higher. But they are all struggling. They can't find enough tradies. They are struggling with supply; they simply can't build for demand. It is supply that will fix these challenges, and I urge those opposite to help them.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:27</span>):  I rise in response to the ill-founded criticism of the 2023 federal budget by those opposite, who clearly are having a difficult time accepting the fact that the Albanese Labor government has achieved, in merely a year, more positive and productive legislation to support all Australians than the opposition could manage in a decade of power. We have passed more than 80 pieces of legislation, including bills that are effective and absolutely help ease cost-of-living pressures. We have spent the first 12 months since the Australian people voted for a positive change working hard to deliver stronger foundations for a better future for all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Families in my electorate of Pearce in Western Australia welcome the many measures that provide cost-of-living relief. Without doubt we are governing in challenging times, facing many global pressures, as are many other governments right around the world. Domestically, growth is expected to slow as inflation and interest rates affect consumer spending. However, the federal budget 2023 is carefully calibrated to alleviate inflationary pressures. We have delivered a responsible and practical budget in response to the local and global financial conditions that we find ourselves in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have committed a $2.2 billion package of measures to strengthen Medicare to make health care more accessible and affordable. We are making medicines cheaper and easier to access, a welcome move for all Australians who rely on medications. That means a family with three scripts a month can now save around $300 to $400 a year, cutting the cost of medicine by up to half for at least six million Australians. We are also making it easier for Australians to see a doctor when they need to by improving after hours access to primary care, something which is a priority, as my community of Pearce can attest. Out-of-pocket health costs are being further reduced by tripling bulk billing incentives for GPs, enabling easier and cheaper access to health care for millions of Australians. We have committed $11.3 billion over four years to fund the outcome of the Fair Work Commission's record 15 per cent pay rise for 250,000 aged-care workers across the country from 1 July 2023. Aged-care workers deserve this action just as those they care for deserve dignity.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also extending the financial safety net for thousands of single parents by expanding access to financial support. The COVID pandemic was not an easy time for our economy. It drove a fall of output of close to seven per cent in a single quarter. That is equivalent to the closure of an entire construction, manufacturing or finance sector overnight. We are continuing our fiscally responsible governance as we work to recover from the pandemic and the effects of global instability. In response we have delivered a sensible and practical budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We experienced the largest energy shock since the oil crisis of the 1970s; as a direct result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine we saw increases in global energy prices of over 55 per cent. As a government we have had to respond appropriately. We are providing relief to over five million households and one million small businesses, and we are powering tomorrow with investments in renewables, industry and skills and technology. Under the Albanese Labor government's energy price relief plan, every household in Western Australia will receive a $400 electricity credit with targeted electricity support totalling $826 for those households in most need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2023 budget supports pensioners and parents. We are responsibly increasing the base rate for JobSeeker and other payments for 1.1 million people. We have handed down a budget that delivers responsible cost-of-living relief and invests in the drivers of economic growth without adding to inflation. We will continue to work incredibly hard to support our local communities and all Australians.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300147" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VIOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:32</span>):  When Labor handed down its budget two weeks ago, Australians were hopeful. They were hopeful that it would ease the cost-of-living crisis that leaves them with very little at the end of each week, with rising mortgages, energy bills and grocery bills. They were hopeful it would rein in spending to bring down inflation and ease the cost of living. Instead they got a typical Labor high-taxing, high-spending budget. This budget confirms the cost of living will continue to rise, gas and electricity prices will continue to skyrocket, unemployment will rise and inflation will remain stubbornly high. Real wages are also going backwards. It also confirmed that 10 million Australians will face a tax hike this year and around 175,000 are projected to lose their jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Small businesses are doing it tough. I have been out in my electorate, like many members of parliament, talking to small businesses. They are struggling. Revenues are down, costs are up and it is putting pressure on them. Unfortunately—they don't want to do this, but one of the key variable costs they can control is wages; they can't control fixed costs like rent and energy—they are having to reduce people's hours and let people go. That's a devastating impact of the economic challenges that we face at the moment. Australians are doing it tough. The number of businesses that have gone into insolvency has almost doubled in the past year. The typical Australian family is $25,000 worse off compared to a year ago. Lifeline reports 80 per cent of its calls now relate to cost-of-living pressures. That's why the coalition is committed to restoring the number of Medicare subsidised psychological sessions from 10 to 20.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's simple. The only way to ease the cost-of-living crisis and bring down inflation is to rein in government spending, but this budget failed to do so. It fails hardworking Australians, when they need a plan to address inflation and the cost-of-living crisis. This government has made inflation worse. Since coming to power, they've increased government discretionary spending by $44 billion—and that's just the on-budget spending, not to mention the off-budget spending of over $45 billion. We know through Chris Richardson, a well-respected economist, that every $6 billion in net government spending requires at least a 0.25 per cent increase in interest rates to balance out that inflationary pressure. So we know that this government's decisions are driving inflation and are forcing the RBA to continue to increase interest rates, punishing all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, the only area where Labor has reined in spending seems to be my community of Casey, where almost all of our road infrastructure projects have been axed or are considered for cuts, including $100 million for community programs for sealing the roads—which this government agreed to when in opposition—and the Wellington Road duplication. And now the Canterbury Road and Killara Road upgrades are under review. Despite this, the government has still found $2.2 billion to redirect to Daniel Andrews's Suburban Rail Loop. Residents in my community deserve to get home safer and sooner, and they want to see these projects delivered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The question for all Australians really is: are you better off today than you were a year ago? Think of how hard Labor has made things after just one year. The Prime Minister may have promised to reduce your power bills by $275—including 30 times after the Russian invasion of Ukraine—but he's yet to deliver on that promise. Our power bills have only gone up, and they will continue to go up. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite benefited from the nine years of strong economic management by the coalition. The books they inherited had the lowest unemployment rate in almost 50 years, with almost two million jobs created over nine years. When we left office, interest rates were at historic lows and unemployment was 3.9 per cent. This low level of unemployment was one of the key drivers of the budget improvement announced earlier this month. I urge this government to start to make decisions to reduce inflation and take pressure off, allowing the RBA to get inflation back to the two to three per cent target. That's the way all Australians can benefit.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300129" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:37</span>):  Another sitting week begins in earnest. On a Monday, out of the gates, we have private members' business. I've got to say I'm just a little bit more chipper than usual, and that is for two reasons in particular. The first reason is, after all, it has now been a year and a day since last year's election, which was when the good people of Spence elected me to this place for the first time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second reason is that a week ago from tomorrow the Treasurer got up in this place and delivered his second budget address. It was a budget that works towards easing many of the pressures faced by Australians and that does so in a responsible way, one that addresses many shortcomings of nine years of a Liberal-National government. It is a budget that benefits many people in Spence, across the state of South Australia and, for that matter, across the entirety of Australia. It does so in a measured and targeted way. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd scarcely think that the member for Forde's intention behind moving his motion today was to provide a platform for members on our side of the chamber, like the member for Solomon and the member for Pearce, to spend our time giving him an informative recap of the budget address. I'm sure he was alert and taking notes on the night, but I am certainly happy to oblige the member for Forde, and I'm sure more of my colleagues are just as eager to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Going by the wording of the motion, it is clear to see that the member for Forde wants a budget that shows fiscal restraint, has simpler and fairer taxes, makes the lives of small businesses and families easier and, at the same time, does not add to inflation. The member for Forde certainly drives a hard bargain. If the budget does all of these things save for one, it turns into a pumpkin and is forever an abject failure in his eyes. It's much like the bus in the movie <span style="font-style:italic;">Speed</span>—if the bus goes above 50 miles an hour it will explode; if it goes below 50 miles an hour it will also explode. This is coupled with a few more elements which I cannot wait to touch on later, but I was raised to eat my vegetables before I could tuck in to my dessert.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Forde's motion also alludes to the first budget delivered by the Albanese Labor government. The member for Forde even goes so far as to say our government 'abandoned all goals of balancing the budget'. He's been a member of this place since the 43rd Parliament. It was almost as if he'd sleepwalked through the budgets delivered under the Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments. In this context, it is even more fitting to refer to it as the ATM government!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Forde's motion also notes that government spending increased in Labor's first budget. Let's examine the ATM government's record in contrast and see whether the member's motion demonstrates naivety or whether he is just cravenly partisan. The economic record the member champions is one that saw expenditure continue to rise with each successive Liberal-National budget—a record that saw debt balloon out prior to the first pandemic budget. I'm isolating that period for my comparison just to be as fair as I possibly can, because unless you're Senator Antic—and perhaps a few others, too—I doubt those opposite believe there were any plans or policies in place regarding the COVID-19 pandemic between the 2014-15 and 2018-19 budgets. I think we can all remember a time when net debt sitting at around 10 per cent of GDP was a core aspect of a debt and deficit disaster, according to those opposite and sections of the media. I must say: as the years drag on, those opposite have gone a bit quiet. I wonder why that might be!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, this budget has forecast a modest surplus in the 2022-23 fiscal year, with an underlying cash balance of 4.2 billion. As the Treasurer noted, we aren't to call it a surplus until it has materialised—not just been forecasted. The Albanese government is one that shows not just fiscal restraint but also the restraint to not sell 'back in black' coffee mugs either; I wonder if they'll put them back up for sale after July!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As many of us know, those opposite have, for a very long time, propagated a myth. It's their oldest myth—blue man, good economic managers; red man, bad. Sometimes they drink their own Kool-Aid! Cognitive dissonance can be a scary thing—truly frightening, indeed. I pray the member for Forde has not fallen victim to it. If so, I hope he listens to our side of the chamber in this debate and puts himself on the road to recovery. Get better soon!</span>

He's no Keanu Reeves but we'll give him his due! It's a good thing Labor's not driving the bus on the road. The only road that Labor is paving at the moment is the road to failure, because it has put a hold on all infrastructure programs and projects for 90 days while it reviews them. Indeed, on Saturday I drove to Sydney and for four hours I drove at the speed limit, of course—100 kilometres an hour. It took me four hours to get to Sydney, and then I turned on the intersection through Newtown, through Grayndler. Then it took me, would you believe, an hour and 20 minutes to travel just 7.1 kilometres.</span>

                  </a>  You can believe it, because that's exactly what happened. I was there to go and watch the Inner West Magpies—the club that you're patron of, Member for Watson! They didn't quite win, just like the people of Australia didn't quite win when the budget was handed down a fortnight ago—not a week ago but a fortnight ago. It was the softest sell of a budget that I've experienced in the time I've been here—that's more than 12 years, more than 12 budgets. Why would that be? Because they had nothing to sell—only more despair and more misery. We're putting a hold on local roads and community infrastructure; there's no new money for that in the budget. The money for the Stronger Communities Program—slashed, gone.</span>

When times got tough we didn't put a restriction on the amount that small businesses could go and fund. Indeed, for the tradie who wanted to get a ute for his business we enabled them to buy that complete ute, not a spare tyre. That's all you get under this mob, and that's a fact.</span>

Ninety-seven times we heard the Prime Minister utter the words, 'Well, there's going to be a $275 power cut.' Where is that power cut? Don't worry about the little asterisk, the little disclaimer: 'Oh, it'll be in five years from now.' I call rubbish, because people out there aren't saying, 'My power bills are going down.' They are saying that they are going up, because they indeed are. You look at the interest rates—up, up, up, up. They're just increasing. Unemployment has gone up. Indeed, when we were—</span>

That's the premise that we were given: 60,000 lives were going to be lost within weeks or months, and we put the action in place to ensure that we protected not only people's lives but their livelihoods. That's what we did. At the same time, through JobKeeper, we protected hundreds of thousands of jobs and hundreds of thousands of small businesses. We kept their doors open because of the policies that we put in place. What did we hear that those opposite wanted to do? They wanted to pay people to get jabs. They go on about the debt and mislead the parliament about a trillion dollars worth of debt. They would have made the debt even higher, and it's already gone up.

They're going to have Canberra decisions made for local projects made around the regions, and that is a disgrace. National Emergency Management Agency staff have already been cut from the regions. That's an absolute fact. There's no localism. There's hardly any money. The veterans wellness centres have all been taken out of coalition seats—such as in Wagga Wagga, where we have all three arms of the military—and gone to Labor seats. Under the Mobile Black Spot Program, all the grants made in New South Wales have been to Labor seats. They talk about colour coded spreadsheets. The only colour on Labor spreadsheets is red—red for Labor and red for debt. This is the true Labor that we get. What a miserable 12 months! What a miserable lot you are!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="298800" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MASCARENHAS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:47</span>):  One year and one day ago, Australians voted to change the country, and they did that by changing the government. I thank the member for Riverina for talking about the pandemic and bringing that up, because Western Australians know who held up the bargain of looking after the public, and the truth is that was Premier Mark McGowan. Australia knows what leadership looks like in a crisis, and they saw that, often, from state premiers. The truth is that we brought up the pandemic and there was this question: 'Well, who was responsible for the saving of lives?' I'll say that there is some work that the federal government did, but there were also some decisions that were made by the federal government that absolutely made that harder, which included not ordering enough vaccinations or getting the vaccination rollout right. I'll highlight some of the things that were said: 'I don't hold a hose.' 'It's not my job.' But there were two things that were his job, which related to ordering enough vaccinations and getting the rollout right, and I'm going to say that those opposite didn't get it right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll also take this opportunity to highlight that the former Prime Minister sided with Clive Palmer and was prepared to open up Western Australia, which was at the forefront of making sure that our economy was ticking. Some of the surplus that was handed down in this budget related to royalties from the resource sector, and that happened because what the Labor Party understands is that, when you get health outcomes right, you get economic benefits, so, if you get the health of your citizens right, you get good economic outcomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I feel so privileged to stand here before the House and talk to this motion, one year and one day after the Albanese Labor government and I were elected. The people of Swan put their faith and trust in me, and that's why I was elected as the first woman to be the member for Swan in its 101-year history. We're getting on with delivering what we promised to Australians. I've had multiple conversations with constituents in my community, and they were relieved to see the adults back in charge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk about promises in politics, we should think back to the choice that Australians had at the 2022 election. I and Labor presented a series of policies to build the foundation for a better future. They included strengthening Medicare. Labor built Medicare and we will always protect it. They also included cheaper child care. The Labor Party understands the importance of access to work, and child care is a part of this—and a part of that's because of the number of women that we have in our caucus. The policies included cheaper medicines because, again, we understand the importance of the health of our communities. They included action on climate change. On our side, we accept the science of climate change, and it makes it so much easier to act when we're all on the same page. They included the National Reconstruction Fund. We want to see more things made here in Australia, and we saw, during the pandemic, what happened with broken-down supply chains. We're also in the process of implementing the aged care royal commission recommendations, because we want to restore dignity for our most experienced Australians. We've introduced domestic violence leave, because we want to lower the hurdles for people escaping those relationships. We've expanded paid parental leave and made it more flexible. We also put in a submission to raise the minimum wage, because our lowest-paid workers deserved a decent pay increase. And of course there is the First Nations Voice to Parliament and the future referendum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In comparison, what was the choice that the Liberals presented to my community? 'I don't hold a hose,' and, 'It's not my job'—no plan; no vision; just disunity, delay and division.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I say to the member for Forde that the budget we delivered on 9 May lives up to what Australians voted for a year ago. I will say that I know that families are doing it tough, and that, for families in my electorate, we're delivering responsible and targeted cost-of-living measures. It's a delicate calibration and we don't want to feed the inflation dragon. There's so much more work that we need to do, but the thing I'd say is that the federal Labor government does not want to waste a day.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="281513" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs McINTOSH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:52</span>):  Along with the member for Riverina, I, too, call 'Rubbish!' Labor's recent budget is typical: big spending, big taxing, with no substance at all—nothing to address inflation, nothing to address the cost-of-living crisis impacting Australians and nothing to address the infrastructure pressures that are faced by communities like mine right across Australia and, in particular, in Western Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prime Minister John Howard, a great Prime Minister, calls my community of Lindsay in Western Sydney 'a microcosm of Australia', because it's got families, it's got retired people, it's got lots and lots of small businesses and it's got a very strong community spirit. It is for these reasons and the aspiration driving my community that we are at the epicentre of the cost-of-living crisis, and it's why we should all be worried that, if the Howard battler of the past becomes the new Albanese abandoned of today, our whole country is in deep trouble.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians listened intently to the budget in the hope that it promised cost-of-living relief and that that would be delivered. It wasn't. As the Leader of the Opposition made clear, many millions of Australians had every right to be disappointed with this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the coalition's budget reply, the opposition leader identified five key omissions by Labor. Ten million Australians face a tax hike this year, and around 175,000 are projected to lose their jobs. This Labor government is spending an additional $185 billion, but millions of middle-income Australians will not receive a cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Amidst the housing and rental crisis, migration will increase by 1.5 million people over five years, and we know that 60 per cent of new migrants go into places like Western Sydney. It is extraordinary, when this is the case, that the Labor government has cut infrastructure spending.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And, of course, power bills are going to go up, not down as promised. The government's policies will cause inflation to stay higher for longer, putting pressure on interest rates. It's the working poor of Western Sydney, working families—they're struggling on two incomes; they're just trying to get ahead for their families—that are hurting most right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A local homelessness and housing organisation has told me that food insecurity is on the rise, and that most of the people coming through the doors to collect food hampers of groceries aren't people sleeping rough; they are pensioners, retirees and families with parents, both on incomes. They are small-business owners. The decision about whether to pay the rent or mortgage or use electricity against putting food on the table is, in fact, very real.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Local cafe owners who have been struggling to find staff are now struggling to make ends meet. Speaking to local businesses, there are a number at threat of closing right now. They tell me they can't absorb all the increased costs of supply chain shortages and they are now left wondering how much people will pay for a coffee when the cafe needs to pass on the costs to keep their doors open.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the shadow assistant minister for mental health and suicide prevention, it was clear to me that there was one glaring omission from the recent budget—that is, a plan to address the mental health crisis. In last week's budget in reply speech, the opposition leader, the Hon. Peter Dutton, prioritised the mental health of Australians by announcing that a returned coalition government would reinstate the full 20 Medicare subsidised psychology sessions, which Labor had cut to 10, on a permanent basis. It is extraordinary that the Labor government will not join us in reinstating these mental health sessions when Australians need them most.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you to the Leader of the Opposition for acting on the calls of the millions of people who suffer from mental health issues and the mental health sector who have been calling upon the Albanese government to return the 20 sessions in full that the previous coalition government first introduced. We need these sessions now more than ever. The pandemic, multiple disasters, now a cost-of-living crisis: the Albanese government needs to listen to Australians, particularly those suffering mental health issues. Australians need and deserve a government that has a plan to address the mental health and cost-of-living crisis facing Australians right now.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Watson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Minister for the Arts and Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:57</span>):  Before the next item on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> is called on, I thought I might give members a bit of information as to how the debate for the referendum bill will proceed. Obviously, it being a referendum bill, it's the sort of legislation that the government won't be referring to the Federation Chamber; it will be, properly, here in the main chamber for as many people who want to be able to speak to it, and that will happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The procedure for referenda is one that most members won't have dealt with before—some will, but most won't. When we get to the third reading, whether a division is called or not, a division will happen automatically. Even if, on one side, there are only a few people voting, every name gets taken down. That's required because of the constitutional provision for an absolute majority on a referendum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The normal pairing arrangements and everything that happens between the whips will still apply for amendments in the second reading vote, but the third reading vote is different. I will try to make sure that members get plenty of notice as to when that third reading vote is so that when people are scheduling different aspects of their lives, they know when that will be. But I want to basically give the undertaking to the House the intention of the government is that the third reading vote will not happen until next week, that this week we'll try to get through as many of the speeches as we possibly can.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once it is returned to the Senate, if the Senate returns any messages, messages from the Senate again require the same absolute majority as a third reading. So when we come back after the short break after this sitting fortnight, if the message from the Senate is that it's carried in the same form as the House, then there's nothing for us to vote on. If there is a message that requires a vote, then that vote will also be one where there's an automatic division regardless of whether or not one's called for. I just thought that sort of information might be helpful for members.</span>

Normally, we would have more of the appropriations debate in the main chamber, but because we have the referendum debate happening, the appropriations debate will be happily principally in the Federation Chamber. We will have had two speakers speak in the main chamber. The Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition have both spoken on it. But under this resolution, it will then go to the Federation Chamber. Each day we'll be listing legislation where there are very few people wanting to speak with the intention that people then get their appropriation speeches down in the Federation Chamber each day. As most members would be aware, the same rules apply to the appropriations debate as apply to the address-in-reply, which is there is no relevance rule. That's a fairly free-ranging debate. That will happen in the Federation Chamber this week and next week. In accordance with the motion, on Tuesday 13 June, we will have the second reading vote here in the House. Then it will go back to the Federation Chamber for the section where we go portfolio by portfolio through the different expenditures and appropriations with the relevant ministers present.

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr KHALIL:</span>
                    </a>  by leave—The committee's report supports the measures in National Security Legislation Amendment (Comprehensive Review and Other Measures No. 2) Bill 2023. The bill implements 10 recommendations of the 2020 Comprehensive Review of the Legal Framework of the National Intelligence Community—known as the Richardson review, after Dennis Richardson, the author—that relate to the Attorney-General's portfolio. The bill also proposes two amendments to the Intelligence Services Act 2001.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The recommendations of the Richardson review implemented by the bill would seek to improve or modernise various legal provisions in order to ensure the national intelligence community can continue to undertake its important work effectively and with appropriate accountability in the current environment in 2023 and into the future. The amendments include removing the ability for the Attorney-General to delegate critical powers related to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, ASIO, as well as restricting the ability to confer powers related to ASIO to another minister, except in exceptional circumstances: providing defences to ASIO offices to certain criminal offences under the criminal code relating to tampering or interfering with telecommunications and carrier facilities; enabling ASIO to use record and disclose spent convictions information under the Crimes Act for the purposes of performing its functions; streamlining and clarifying the oversight of intelligence agencies by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and the Commonwealth Ombudsman, including the requirement for the IGIS to publish public interest disclosure and complaints information in its annual report; and other reforms to the Freedom of Information Act, Archives Act and the Administrative Appeal Tribunal for intelligence agencies and the IGIS to improve clarity and transparency. These amendments are all based on recommendations made by the Richardson review, accepted by government, and developed by the responsible agencies. The evidence provided to the committee has established that these amendments will deliver the improvements and safeguards outlined by the Attorney-General when the bill was introduced and in the bill's explanatory material.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee does make one recommendation in its report regarding the creation of defences under the Criminal Code for ASIO officers when utilising some of that agency's most covert and intrusive capabilities. In evidence to the committee it became clear that the application of the defences may be wider than originally envisaged, in extending to a broadly defined category of 'ASIO affiliates'. Accordingly, the committee has recommended that the explanatory memorandum for the bill be amended to acknowledge this fact, and that future review of the home affairs minister's guidelines to ASIO consider the need for appropriate safeguards over such people and the defences that may be applicable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill contains two further proposed amendments. The bill would amend the intelligence services act 2001 to change the constitution and the quorum of the intelligence and security committee. It would also amend the requirements for directions from the foreign minister to the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) regarding activities relating to the capabilities, intentions or activities of people or organisations outside Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments were considered and supported by the committee's report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Classified evidence provided by ASIS and the IGIS gave the committee confidence that the proposed amendments regarding ministerial directions to ASIS were required for the proper exercise of ministerial responsibility over its most sensitive operations. The committee thanks both ASIS and the IGIS for their forthright cooperation with the committee in this review. This committee is unique in the parliament in its ability to receive highly classified and sensitive information to aid its deliberations, and the cooperation of the intelligence community in that regard helps ensure the appropriate rigour to the committee's considerations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed changes to the composition of the PJCIS, the intelligence and security committee, increase its membership by two, to 13 members, and its quorum from six to seven members, which will allow for increased flexibility and an increased membership on the committee to engage in its important work. I note that there is a dissenting report from the opposition, which is somewhat disappointing given this has been a very strongly collegiate and bipartisan committee. I would say that the collegiality has continued, although the bipartisanship on this particular report has not, and we have in good faith engaged and done our best to reach a consensus. Unfortunately, on this occasion we haven't. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would not like to pre-empt the deputy chair's statement on the dissenting report, but I would simply like to say very clearly—and this is important for the record—that the changes that are proposed in the amendments and the recommendations in the committee's report do not change the appointment process or the key requirement that the government of the day hold a majority on the committee. In other words, the powers to appoint any member of this parliament to that committee exist currently and have nothing to do with these particular changes. These changes that are recommended are to increase the number of the committee and also change the composition of the committee, with respect to the requirement for a certain number of members of the House and Senate as a minimum threshold. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the committee I would like to thank those who participated in the bill review by providing a high-quality level of evidence within a very short time frame to assist our deliberations. I would like to thank the Deputy Speaker—sorry; I mean the deputy chair of the committee. I would like to thank you, too, Deputy Speaker Vasta, but certainly I thank the deputy chair and other members of the committee for all the hard work that they've put in during the course of this particular review and in the short time frame we had to deliberate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend this report to the House.</span>

The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security is widely recognised as the most important and functional committee of the parliament and has played a key role in supporting successive federal governments to protect the national security of Australia. Its members, past and present, have prided themselves on working together constructively in a bipartisan way in the national interest.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the outset, the opposition affirms all of the 10 recommendations contained within the comprehensive review which are the subject of this inquiry. The opposition agrees with those recommendations, as it does with the changes sought by the government with respect to amending part 2 of the Intelligence Services Act, that is, in relation to clarifying the current uncertainty relating to the level of detail required in the ministerial direction issued under section 6(1)(e) of the Intelligence Services Act. The sole point of contention between the government and opposition members of the committee arises out of the government's unilateral proposal to change the member composition and quorum requirements of the committee. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is with considerable regret that the opposition feels compelled to provide a dissenting report in this inquiry. Opposition members note that this is the first time in 17 years that the committee has not reached a consensus on its recommendations, and it is the first time that I have risen in this place to speak on a report the subject of the inquiry. I've always tried, on behalf of opposition members, to allow the Australian public to consider that when this committee speaks it speaks with the voice of both the government and the opposition. But on this occasion I have to rise. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee is peculiar in nature from all other committees of the parliament in that it receives classified briefings from security agencies. Classified information is shared with members of the committee up to the most classified level—namely, top secret. Just like relevant ministers who operate in this sphere, members of the committee are not required to possess any security clearances whatsoever. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the proposed amendments, schedule 1 part 3 of the bill would amend the Intelligence Services Act to provide that the committee is to consist of 13 members, comprised of at least two government senators, two government members of the House of Representatives, two non-government senators and two non-government members of the House of Representatives. The remaining five members could be drawn from either chamber. It also raises the quorum requirements from six to seven. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the great concerns I have, in relation to this inquiry, is the manner in which it is being conducted by the government. This inquiry has been irregular, it has been rushed and it has been contrary to the good conduct of a national security inquiry of this importance. On 29 March 2023, the Attorney-General referred the bill to the committee for inquiry and report. The committee was asked to report less than one month later. No justification was provided for this extremely short time frame. This unreasonably short time line for the inquiry meant stakeholders were given just five business days to provide submissions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Such a short time frame is disrespectful to stakeholders and, otherwise, unacceptable when it involves the examination of important amendments to national security legislation. Such inordinate pressure regarding legislation that is not so time sensitive is inexcusable and is most certainly contrary to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Set the standard: Report on the independent review into commonwealth parliamentary workplaces</span>. It has to be remembered that these time frames impact not just on members in this place but, importantly, on the secretariat that supports us members—as, of course, it does to stakeholders. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Stakeholders' and the committee's work is hindered by the undue haste in which this inquiry is being conducted. In fact, the Law Council, in their submission, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Law Council has been unable to consider all aspects of the Bill in detail because of the limited time for consultation, nor has it had the opportunity to adequately consult with its membership on the proposed reforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similar complaints were made in other submissions and correspondence received by the committee. In its written submission, the Attorney-General's Department claimed the amendment to section 28(2) of the Intelligence Services Act:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… is intended to allow for greater flexibility in determining PJCIS membership while retaining the requirement for representation of both the Senate and House of Representatives, and Government and non-Government members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">None of the other written submissions included any reference to the changes to the composition of this committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In oral evidence given on 11 April, when asked about the risks involved in increasing the number of people on the committee and the risk of classified information being leaked, the Director-General of Security said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">'Need to know' is a sound principle. And, yes, the more people know something, the risk increases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to a question on notice, the Attorney-General's Department conceded that it did not consult with or advise any non-government parliamentarians on the proposed changes to the membership and composition of the committee. It also conceded that these measures were a recommendation of the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No appropriate justification has been provided to the committee by the Attorney-General as to the compression of relevant time frames in the conduct of this inquiry. The committee relies heavily upon well-researched, considered, meaningful submissions made by stakeholders in order to do its important work. If the committee is to properly perform its statutory role of oversight of intelligence agencies and relevant legislation, it must be afforded appropriate time frames in which to conduct its own work—unless exceptional circumstances apply, and that is not the case here. The government has tacked on these proposed reforms to a bill, the contents of which are not time sensitive. The former and current governments have been working their way through the comprehensive review's 203 recommendations since December 2019.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no evidence that supports the assertion by the Attorney-General's Department that the proposed changes to the composition of the committee would lead to greater oversight and accountability of Australia's intelligence and security agencies. Simply adding a further two members to the committee would not lead to any greater parliamentary oversight—indeed, the opposite may be the case. To allow more members on the committee could result in a perverse outcome. Sharing the responsibility between more members could result in a reduction in the knowledge base of individual members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, it's important to note that the proposed amendments to section 28(2) of the Intelligence Services Act could result in the government enjoying an overwhelming majority of nine positions on the committee, with the non-government numbers being limited to just four positions. It is entirely possible, under this strict wording of the legislation, that the opposition could be cut out altogether and those four non-government positions could be handed to the crossbench. This is unacceptable to the opposition. Such an outcome would not only significantly weaken the utility of the committee's oversight responsibilities; it would almost certainly impact upon the bipartisan nature and good standing of this committee. It could also create a corporate knowledge gap for relevant members of the opposition who may be called to serve on the committee after a change of government. Politics goes in cycles, and those opposite should always remember that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition accepts the government of the day should retain a majority on the committee, as currently required by section 28(3). We have no quibble with that. The opposition considers that the only members who should sit on the committee should be parties of government. That has been the case since this committee was established in 1988, with one exception. That is by convention. Yes, the legislation enables, effectively, the Prime Minister of the day to appoint crossbenchers, but by convention that has not been the case, with only one exception. The addition of two more members to the committee increases the risk of classified material being leaked either intentionally or inadvertently, as the Director-General of Security stated in his oral evidence. Axiomatically, the fewer people who know a secret, the less chance that secret has of falling into the wrong hands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition is greatly concerned that the government's decision to increase the number of members of the committee is as a result of some deal done between the government and the crossbench, and the Prime Minister intends to appoint at least one member of the crossbench as one of the two additional members of the committee. The success of the committee over the years is in part as a result of it being comprised of members of the parties of government, which have a stake in ensuring that national security legislation is effective, workable, consistent and appropriate to the risks faced, no matter what party is in government. This is important because with only one exception, as I've said, at all times members on this committee have been members of parties of government. The addition of a member of the crossbench risks undermining the trust and confidence built up on the committee over successive parliaments and rendering it simply like any other committee of the parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the history of bipartisanship on the committee, if government believed these changes were necessary and urgent, they could have approached this inquiry very differently, including by consulting with and seeking the support of the opposition. Instead, by unilaterally proposing changes to the committee as part of a rushed inquiry, the government has given the impression that a political deal has been done with the crossbench to fundamentally alter the composition and therefore the culture of this committee. The proof will be in the pudding as to what happens over the next couple of months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition also opposes the proposed changes to the committee composition, which could see a significant underrepresentation of one chamber or the other. The opposition is concerned that the proposed changes to the composition of the committee are a result of internal politics within the government. Membership on the committee is a sought-after prize for many members of parliament. After the May 2022 election, the government was not able to resolve who its members of the committee would be for at least three months. Despite the committee being widely recognised as the most important committee of the parliament, it was not capable of being reconvened until 6 September 2022. The committee's important work should never be held hostage to any party's internal machinations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed amendments to section 28(2) of the Intelligence Services Act were not recommended by Mr Richardson in the comprehensive review. If these amendments were considered necessary or appropriate, one wonders why they were not included in the most detailed examination of the intelligence and security framework since the Hope royal commissions of the seventies and eighties. Indeed, on the evidence of the Attorney-General's Department, the proposed amendments to the composition of the committee were not recommended by any stakeholder. The proposed changes to section 28(2) of the Intelligence Services Act emanate from the government itself, entirely devoid of any consultation with the parliament or stakeholders outside of the executive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition has not sought to block the proposed amendments to section 28(2) of the Intelligence Services Act for opposition's sake. Rather, it has always sought to be constructive in its approach to the reform of important national security legislation, which is why the opposition provided various alternatives for the government to consider other than the one it landed on. The fact that the government handed down its response to this recommendation on the same day that the report was provided suggests that, on the government's response, it had well and truly made its mind up. This government knew where it was going. The same day the report was handed down, the government provided its response. This was a fait accompli, decided and determined lock, stock and barrel by the Attorney-General before this matter even went to the committee. It is a disgrace. I use those terms very carefully, because it is with no joy that I rise in this place for the first time in 17 years that the PJCIS has not handed down a bipartisan report.</span>

                    </a>  by leave—I had the great honour of being the deputy chair of this committee. I thank the chair, Senator Green, and my fellow committee members, including, in this House, the members for Newcastle; Cowper; Calare; Dunkley; Blair; and Robertson; and Senators Liddle, who's here behind me; Bragg; Cox; Stewart; and White. I thank all who took the time to prepare submissions and appear as witnesses. I especially thank those witnesses who were prepared to publicly raise their concerns about the model. To do so took moral courage. They were not afflicted by subconscious racism or bedwetting or the odious slur 'Judas betrayal'. They are our fellow Australians, many of whom have worked tirelessly for years in support of the cause of reconciliation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are better than this. If such attacks on motive and personality are normalised we will be a more divided nation, no matter the referendum result. From our boardrooms to our lounge rooms, we know that well-meaning Australians will hold views that do not align with the press releases of their corporate employers, their professional associations or their sporting codes or with the views of their family, their friends and their political party. That is how a confident democracy works—to be a contrarian, to stand up for what you believe in when all around you seem of a different view, is the true measure of character and courage. It is one of the most Australian things that you can do. This includes members of my party, such as my friends the members for Bass and Berowra, and it includes a young man who stood up at my party's Victorian state council on the weekend to back the Voice. These are also people of character and courage, and I'm proud to call them friends. So when we see that this committee did not agree, that too is how a confident democracy works. Our views are reflected in the majority report, two dissenting reports and two additional comments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition does not support the proposal as presently drafted, but it is also right that Australians will have the final say. In having their say, their vote may hinge on the aspiration of equality of citizenship. Australia is not perfect—we know that—but our democracy is older and more stable than just about all others. Many sought to downplay this aspiration by pointing to constitutional relics like section 25 or inequality of voting in the Senate. This form of deductive reasoning is erroneous. Examples of imperfection should not be used to justify others. In having their say, their vote may hinge on whether a new national institution can address obvious Indigenous disadvantage or whether a new body will be captured by bureaucratic inertia. And in having their say, the vote of Australians may hinge on whether the wording contains unacceptable constitutional risk. And that was the focus of this committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk of risk it must be assessed with one eye on severity and the other on likelihood, because both matter. It is why we treat risk for aircraft maintenance more seriously than we do for fixing a pushbike. Small risks that might have catastrophic consequences should not be ignored. We should be just as careful when considering a change to our Constitution, our founding and permanent democratic document. The committee heard evidence from the government's own legal experts that, if the proposed amendments are made and if the twin duties to consult and consider are found, this will make governance unworkable. Even those experts who sought to downplay the likelihood of this happening cannot be sure of whether that would occur, so even a low risk is a risk that we should take seriously.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's an old saying that if you ask two lawyers to look at a problem you are bound to get at least three opinions. This is more than just a dig at my former profession. Rather, it points to something inherent in legal problems—namely, that reasonable minds can and do frequently disagree with each other. We heard evidence and received submissions from over 100 lawyers. Opinions differed greatly. Lined up on both sides of the argument were eminent legal minds. We do not doubt that the conflicting opinions of all of these lawyers are sincerely held. However, the fact is that some have to be wrong. Only a future High Court will get to decide who it is. The government members of the committee believe that they can say which legal opinions are right and which are wrong. We on this side believe that it is a trap to only listen to the advice that you want to hear.</span>

We looked for options that would eliminate or reduce risk in a way that is consistent with the intent of this proposal. None of those options would prevent the Voice from making representations to the parliament or the executive. They would do no more than eliminate the risk of making government unworkable.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:30</span>):  by leave—This legislation seeks to insert a new chapter in Australia's Constitution. It is part of starting a new chapter in Australia's history. The new chapter in the Constitution includes, solely, proposed section 129, which recognises First Nations people, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, as the First Peoples of this country; which establishes the Voice and the right to make representations; and which gives the parliament ultimate power over the way that Voice will be structured and will operate, and the way its representations will be made and what will be done with them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Noel Pearson said to the committee during the inquiry with respect to section 129:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These are beautiful words. The proposed provision will adorn the Constitution. I've listened to many submissions, I've read all of them and I've listened to people present, and I haven't found a really compelling reason to change the words that the government has introduced into the House. I think children of the future will look back on these words and really be proud of the Constitution. I think this is a good provision. It has a real sense of history. It honours Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It's a safe provision. It's a provision that meets the needs of Australia and the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No matter what those on the other side of the chamber may say, those words, those positive words from Mr Pearson, accurately summarise the absolutely overwhelming majority of submissions to the committee inquiry and evidence the committee received.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's been talk—it's in the dissenting report—about this process somehow being rushed and this legislation being rushed. It is difficult to identify a prereferendum process since Federation that can hold a candle to the processes that have led us to this point on the proposal. No referendum has been preceded by more debate or more engagement by parliamentarians, legal experts and community members than this one. There was an expert panel on the recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Constitution established in 2010 which conducted community consultation and produced a report in 2012. There was the 2015 report of the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. There was the First Nations constitutional dialogues conducted by the Referendum Council in 2016 and 2017 to discuss options for constitutional reform led by Aboriginal peoples. There was the First Nations Constitutional Convention at Uluru held by the Referendum Council in 2017 to ratify the decision-making of the constitutional dialogues. There was the final report of the Referendum Council in June 2017 which endorsed the Uluru Statement from the Heart and called for voice, treaty and truth. There was the 2018 report of the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. There was the codesign interim report in 2020 and final report in 2021.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And then the Labor Party, this government, went to the 2022 federal election with a clear commitment to hold a referendum in this term of parliament. The Australian people elected a government committed to holding a referendum. The draft constitutional amendment was announced by the Prime Minister in July 2022. That draft text was subject to robust scrutiny and testing from the Referendum Working Group, the Constitutional Expert Group and other legal experts. As a result of that process, the government made changes to the draft text, including to put beyond doubt the broad scope of the parliament's power to make laws relating to the Voice. And then we had the joint committee process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We completed our inquiry on 12 May 2023. There were hundreds of submissions, thousands of comments and scores of people who gave evidence. The joint select committee made a single recommendation—that the bill be passed without amendment. The evidence we heard during that committee process—from Canberra to Orange, Cairns, Perth and back to Canberra—was powerful and moving. It was from people who were engaged in the Uluru dialogue and the process that led to the Statement from the Heart. It was evidence about the importance of constitutional recognition and about the importance of being able to have a consultative role in the development of policies that impact directly on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It was evidence about Australia's history, why we are where we are now and why this is so important. Aunty Pat Anderson told the committee:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">What they asked for was a voice to Canberra, not a Canberra voice. What we heard in the dialogues was that—and this is why reserved seats and designated parliamentary seats weren't prominent—people don't want to be politicians. In the dialogues they said they did not want to be politicians. They don't belong to political parties. They don't want to be going to Canberra to be politicians. They want to serve their community. They want to live in their communities and serve their mobs and their families. They're extraordinary men and women. They've lived their whole lives in their communities helping their own mobs. … They have no intention of leaving their communities. That's at the heart of the Uluru Statement from the Heart and the Voice to Parliament. It is about getting grassroots voices amplified and feeding into Canberra, representing the views and voices of their communities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is about people and this country. It is about Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. It is also an amendment to our Constitution, which means that we did hear from a range of constitutional experts. It is sophistry to say that, when you have an overwhelming majority of legal experts of one opinion, the outlying opinion of just a few people somehow can balance that. It can't and it doesn't. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The idea of legal risk was addressed fairly during this committee inquiry. Bret Walker SC, who appears in the High Court more than any barrister in Australia, told the committee that the idea of the Voice 'somehow jamming the courts from here to kingdom come as a result of this enactment, is really too silly for words'. The dissenting report from the Liberal members of this committee tried to rely on evidence of former High Court judges and chief justices to say that even they acknowledge there is some risk. It takes it out of the context of what those witnesses' evidence was, which is that this is a sound proposal that will benefit our community and will not lead to the sorts of fantastical outcomes that those on the other side have proposed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Solicitor-General said the proposal to enshrine a Voice in the Constitution is not only compatible with Australia's system of representative and responsible government but would enhance that system. Why are people so concerned about enhancing our system and instead pay tribute in the dissenting report to, let's face it, the white men who drafted Australia's Constitution—</span>

There's no mention of the fact that First Nations people were left out of the Constitution. That's what we're here to address.

After hearing all of the evidence in the inquiry that I was a part of, there is only one reasonable conclusion open to the committee: the draft provision is constitutionally sound and should be supported in its present form. Listening to communities instead of saying, 'We know better,' leads to better laws, policies and outcomes, making a practical difference on the ground in areas like health, education and housing. Having a moment where all of us, Indigenous and non-Indigenous people, can be proud of ourselves as a country is what the Voice will help to deliver. Thank you.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="261393" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:42</span>):  by leave—I'd like to thank all committee members for their work on this inquiry. I support the committee's recommendation that the bill be passed unamended. I was very grateful that the inquiry came to Orange in the Central West of New South Wales to hear evidence. That evidence included some very powerful testimony from Deputy Mayor Gerald Power, Councillor Jeff Whitton, Jamie Newman, Alisha Agland, Annette Steel, Roy Ah-See, Kim Whiteley, Helen and Sharon Riley, and Dinawan Dyirribang, or Bill Allen Jr. I think that evidence made a very significant contribution to the inquiry, and I wish to thank them for it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst, as we've heard today, the committee did hear some differing legal opinion, I found the evidence that the proposed words are legally sound to be highly persuasive. I thought that evidence was very clear, very strong, very consistent and very robust. As the member for Dunkley has pointed out, Bret Walker SC told the committee that the suggestion that the High Court could be bogged down in an endless procession of court challenges is 'too silly for words' and 'nonsense'. It wasn't just Bret Walker SC saying this. Other evidence supporting the constitutional soundness of the bill and the proposed words included former High Court Chief Justice Robert French, former High Court Justice Kenneth Hayne, Professor Anne Twomey, Professor George Williams and Dr Shireen Morris. They are some of the biggest rock stars in the constitutional law world, and they could hardly be described as flag-waving barricade-storming radicals. They were joined by the likes of the New South Wales Bar Association, the University of Sydney Law School, Adelaide Law School, the Law Council of Australia, major firms like Gilbert + Tobin and a whole host of others who believe that the words as proposed are sound. The Solicitor-General agrees with that conclusion as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think this committee also served a very useful purpose in exposing some of the baseless fearmongering and outlandish statements that have been made and have accompanied some of the commentary with respect to the Voice. For example, the evidence clearly showed that it is ridiculous to suggest that the Voice, if it was to pass, could or would imperil Anzac Day, federal budgets or nuclear submarine contracts. I think those suggestions are as arrantly ridiculous as they are insulting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I conclude my remarks today with some words from Gerald Power, the deputy mayor of Orange, who gave this evidence to the committee. He said this about the Voice, and why it needs to be in the Constitution:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">What it is, simply, is that we need a voice. The 1967 referendum said: these are small steps. At the age of 61, I never thought that we would even come to this. I thought I'd be dead. I thought my son would have to pick it up. My mother died and my ancestors died without having a voice in the Constitution, and that lack of a voice is simply because we were never identified as humans. Why is it so important to have it in the Constitution? It is because it needs to be in there. It needs to at least acknowledge that there were humans here and that these are the oldest humans on the face of the planet—continuous, ongoing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I again wish to thank all members of the committee, in particular Senator Green for doing an excellent job in chairing, and also the secretariat, who worked very hard in a very short period of time. I will expand on my remarks when I have my opportunity to speak on the bill. I commend the recommendation of the committee to the parliament, and I also urge Australia to get behind the Voice.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dickson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:47</span>):  This year Australians will head to the polls. They won't be voting for a future government, as important as that is, but they will be voting as to whether they should change or preserve our Constitution, our nation's rule book. It's one of the most important decisions Australians will make in their lifetime. If Australians vote for change, then our nation, our democracy and their lives will be fundamentally altered—and, in this case, not for the better. Changing our Constitution to enshrine a voice will take our country backwards, not forwards. The Voice is regressive, not progressive, and it should be very clear to Australians by now that the Prime Minister is dividing our country, not uniting us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Constitution came into effect in 1901. During the 1890s our forefathers pored over the details of other constitutions to draft our own. They were methodical, they were meticulous and they used their minds, and, to their eternal credit and foresight, they produced a document which has created the greatest country in the world. Our forefathers weren't perfect—no human can be—but it speaks volumes that they got so much right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 122 years, just eight of 44 referendums to change our Constitution have been successful; that's 18 per cent of all changes proposed. Of those eight changes, seven were delivered under Liberal leaders. Our Constitution has given us laws, liberties, protections and privileges which have forged the modern nation which we love and cherish today. Australians who have come from or visited other parts of the world—indeed, any of us who watch the international news—appreciate just how lucky we are not by chance but by design. Nowhere else in the world is there a success story like ours, one of Indigenous heritage, of British inheritance and of migration and multicultural success—three threads woven together brilliantly and harmoniously. Our nation works and our democratic system works. By and large Australians are pleased with their Constitution, which has served them well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Constitution is not something to be toyed with lightly, yet that's exactly what this Prime Minister is doing. Whenever we've made a change to the Constitution in the past, there's been a convention. People have come together to thrash out the proposal and examine the pros and cons. They've done so in the same spirit and with the same care as our forefathers who drafted the Constitution. Yet for this Voice, there's been no constitutional convention—quite deliberately. Instead, we have had a 4½ day committee, a kangaroo court led by a government that never wanted to entertain changes to its proposed bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister refuses to provide even the most basic of detail on the Voice model. The proposition is that he wants you to vote on Saturday and come Monday he'll spend six months working out the detail. Details should come before the vote, not the vote before the details. The process is without precedent. Australians deserve the details so that they can make an informed decision. Now, what's most curious about this referendum is the government prefers Australians to be incurious. When Australians have raised reasonable and legitimate concerns about the Voice model, the government dismisses them as a scare campaign, as nonsense, as noise and misinformation. The government wants you to vote for the Voice on a vibe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, the Prime Minister has characterised this referendum as being about two principles: recognition and consultation. Let me address each in turn. Both of the major parties support seeing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians recognised in the Constitution. I suspect an overwhelming majority of Australians feel the same way. But the Prime Minister's being tricky here. He's seeking to conflate two separate issues: (1) constitutional recognition and (2) enshrining the Voice in the Constitution. He wants to leverage the overwhelming public support for constitutional recognition to piggyback his poorly defined, untested and risk ridden Canberra Voice model. And isn't it telling that in the 'yes' campaign's first video, the advertisement mentions recognition, but it fails to mention the Voice even once.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the Prime Minister's principle of consultation, he has said that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should have their say in the decisions and policies that affect their lives. Here, too, he is being misleading because they already do. There are hundreds of bodies across the nation which represent Indigenous views and are made up of Indigenous Australians, and rightly so. The National Indigenous Australians Agency website and corporate plan says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We … ensure Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have a say in the decisions that affect them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Moreover, our federal parliament today has record levels of Indigenous representation. The eight senators and three members of the House of Representatives constitute 4.8 per cent of parliament overall. That's a larger representation compared to the 3.2 per cent of our population who identify as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islanders, and it's a wonderful thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, every parliamentarian, Indigenous or otherwise, represents their constituents—Indigenous or otherwise. And consultation is not the issue. Listening to communities at the local level is the issue. The Prime Minister calls this referendum a modest request, but there's nothing modest about the change being proposed. Since 1901, power has been carefully balanced between three institutions: the parliament, which makes and changes laws; the government and Public Service, which put the laws into action; and the courts, which interpret the laws. A Voice will be a new institution. There's no comparable constitutional body in any other country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the referendum is successful, amendments will not be made to existing chapters of the Constitution; rather, a new chapter will be inserted. Now that should set off alarm bells in the mind of every Australian. At the very least, it calls into question the purely advisory nature of the Voice and the way in which the High Court may interpret the body's authority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A Voice would be the most radical and consequential change to the way our democracy operates in our nation's history. Furthermore, if a Voice is embedded in the Constitution, the parliament can't change the Voice or pass laws to override it. The parliament cannot out legislate the Constitution. If Australians have buyers remorse, the Voice comes with a no-returns policy. It's here to stay, yet this institution hasn't even been road tested. It hasn't been legislated, as has been the case in South Australia. The Albanese government has this option available and open to them today. We would have seen how it worked and rectified any issues. Naturally, as all Australians instinctively know, you wouldn't buy a house without inspecting it and you wouldn't purchase a car without test-driving it, yet the government wants you to vote on a voice not knowing what it is or what it can do. The approach is a reckless roll of the dice. The Prime Minister might be seeking his moment in history, but that shouldn't be at the expense of our country's future or our democracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The most problematic aspect of this bill is the words which would be inserted in the Constitution in placitum (ii) of the proposed new section 129, namely that the Voice will have extraordinary constitutional powers to 'make representations to the parliament and the executive government of the Commonwealth on matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples'. If there's any sign that the words in placitum (ii) are controversial and ambiguous, it's that they have divided the legal community and our very best constitutional minds, especially on the inclusion of 'executive government'. In substance, this clause establishes a constitutional guarantee: the Voice would be able to make representations about any matter—for example, on the economy, defence, national security, foreign affairs, infrastructure, health, education and more besides. No issue would be beyond the scope of representations made by the Voice. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The late David Jackson AM, KC, one of Australia's pre-eminent constitutional lawyers, said that any attempt to limit the Voice's power to make representations would be invalid. Within placitum (iii), the words 'subject to this Constitution' mean that the High Court will determine the powers, functions and remit of the Voice, not the parliament. Of course, the broad remit of the Voice is deliberate by design. The referendum working group's Megan Davis has said that the parliament can't 'shut the Voice up' and that it should have a 'self-determined scope'. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here are three plausible examples of representations based on the advice of Megan Davis and of many lawyers. Say, for example, the government is planning to expand a defence base. The Voice may make a representation to stop that building work from proceeding because it will take place on lands with a strong Indigenous connection. Or say the government is finalising its budget priorities. The Voice may make a representation to question funding allocations, holding up the process. Or say the government is amending the Australian Curriculum. The Voice may make a representation seeking that a particular version of Australian history be taught in classrooms. Such representations would not operate in a policy vacuum. They would affect all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What about Public Service departments and agencies having to consider the Voice's representations? Well, the government's constitutional expert group and the Solicitor-General haven't ruled out. In fact, experts are torn on that matter as well. Indeed, under the Voice Design Principles, federal departments, agencies and this parliament would write to the Voice to seek representations when developing policies and laws. The House deals with about 200 bills each year. How on earth, practically, will the Voice be able to handle that workload? This is exactly the idea of a constitutional convention—to thrash out these difficulties, to have a better understanding of the import. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most importantly, if the Voice is displeased with the way in which it has been consulted or with a decision made, it can appeal to the courts. As many legal experts have acknowledged, the Voice could grind our system to a halt from the resulting years of litigation, and the High Court—not the parliament—will make the final judgement on a disputed matter. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the triumphs of Australia is that we have an egalitarian society. We're all equal before the law, and all have the same liberties, whether you're an Indigenous Australian, you're Australian born or you have come from around the world and become an Australian citizen. It wasn't always this way, but we course-corrected. After the Second World War, Liberal prime ministers Robert Menzies and Harold Holt began dismantling the White Australia policy, and in 1967 Harold Holt oversaw the successful referendum where Australians voted overwhelmingly to amend the Constitution to include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the census and allow the Commonwealth to make laws for them. It was another great step towards equality, which finally came in 1984 when voting became compulsory for Indigenous Australians. But this referendum on the Voice will undermine our equality of citizenship. It's an overcorrection. The Voice will embed new procedural rights in our Constitution—rights which are conferred only on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice. It will have an Orwellian effect, where all Australians are equal but some Australians are more equal than others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the Voice is embedded in our Constitution, there will be little to rejoice—for, when we sing the second line of our national anthem, 'For we are one and free,' instead of being one, we will be divided, in spirit and in law. The great progress of the 20th century's civil rights movements was the push to eradicate difference—to judge each other on the content of our character, not the colour of our skin. The Voice, as proposed by the Prime Minister, promotes difference. And it's, sadly, a symptom of the madness of identity politics which has infected the 21st century. The Voice will re-racialise our nation. At a time when we need to unite the country, this Prime Minister's proposal will permanently divide us by race.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, the Liberal Party supports constitutional recognition, but we do not support enshrining in our Constitution a divisive, disrupting and democracy-altering Canberra based Voice. We all yearn for practical outcomes which will improve the lives of Indigenous Australians. No leader, no party and no Australian occupies the moral high ground on this matter. We all want to see these improvements, especially in remote communities where so many are living unimaginable lives. And there is a way to achieve these improvements under our approach, which unites the nation. We support establishing a ground-up model of local and regional bodies, as recommended by Professor Calma and Professor Langton, with the voices of Indigenous elders, leaders and members of the community at these levels, who can offer the best solutions because they're living among the problems. And they will do a far better job than academics and capital-city elites who are more focused on power-grabs than on reversing the tyranny of dispossession. We need a bottom-up approach, not another top-down one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to what local Indigenous communities need, Labor believes that Canberra knows best. We believe that local communities know best. That's why the government I lead will reinstate the cashless debit card in communities who seek to have it, because, since the government abolished it without explanation, we've seen a rapid rise in domestic and other violence in the heart of those communities. It's why we'll provide additional Australian Federal Police support in Alice Springs, just as locals have been begging.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister said that this referendum is not just about the heart but is also about the head, yet every argument put forward by the government has been based on emotion, not reason. The government has been incapable of moderation or compromise. It's been naive and incautious about the consequences of this risky, divisive, unknown and permanent change to our Constitution. And Australians will be asked to vote on a constitutional change that has not been fully scrutinised and is fundamentally uncertain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal Party does not consider that the proposal in this bill should be adopted, but we will not stand in the way of the Australian people having their say. After all, the outcome of this referendum is not any political party's choice; it's not the choice of the Referendum Working Group; it's not the choice of the corporate entities or sporting codes who have nailed their colours to this mast; it's not the choice of the celebrities and social media influencers who will be rolled out in this campaign. Rather, it is the choice of the Australian people. It's every Australian's choice. And, given the democracy-altering implications of this choice, I simply encourage all Australians to be guided by their heads. I thank the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="8GH" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BURNEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Indigenous Australians</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:03</span>):  We have just heard, in one speech, every bit of disinformation and misinformation and every scare campaign that exists in this debate. I am very pleased that politicians can step out of this, after this debate on the alteration bill, because the one thing I agreed with, in terms of the Leader of the Opposition, is that this is not a decision or a plaything of politicians. It is a decision of the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Almost 56 years ago today Australians voted in the 1967 referendum. It was a major turning point in the Australian story, a unifying moment, one that appealed to Australians' innate sense of fairness. In 2023 Australians will again vote in the referendum, one based on hope: hope for a better future, hope built on the aspirations of Indigenous Australians embodied in the Uluru Statement from the Heart. In 2023 it is time for recognition. It is time for an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice to the Parliament, because Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have not enjoyed the same opportunities as so many other Australians. In fact, Indigenous Australians have been left behind. There is an almost nine-year gap in life expectancy and a gap in infant mortality, and our young people are robbed of their potential, languishing behind bars in a justice system that has let them down. It isn't good enough. Something has to change and change for the better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Later this year we will get the chance to do something better, because constitutional recognition through a voice to the parliament is about giving Indigenous Australians a say in matters that affect them. It means delivering structural change that empowers Indigenous communities. It means getting better advice so that we get better policies and better outcomes. Let me be clear. The disadvantages experienced by Indigenous Australians are not the fault of any single individual today, but it is all about responsibility to strive for a more reconciled future, a better future that recognises First Nations people's rightful place in this country, a better future that genuinely listens to the needs and aspirations of Indigenous Australians, which brings me to the Uluru Statement from the Heart.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Almost six years ago today, Indigenous Australians from right across the country gathered at Uluru to deliver a statement from the heart in a historic First Nations consensus on a way forward. The statement was supported by over 250 delegates following consultation with 1,200 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who were involved in the referendum council lead-up Uluru dialogues. To Megan Davis, Noel Pearson and Pat Anderson: thank you for your leadership during this pivotal time. This great endeavour has not been rushed into. No shortcuts have been taken. It has been a grassroots movement, the culmination of years of discussion, consultation and hard work by so many. At its heart the Uluru statement is about listening, listening to the advice from on the ground in communities, because listening is a prerequisite for policies that work, good policy that makes a practical difference, policy like the Indigenous-led health clinics delivering dialysis or treatment for rheumatic heart disease where people live, improving health outcomes and saving whole families from endless travel; policy like the Indigenous Rangers program, which has reduced unemployment rates, given young people a sense of purpose and boosted the protection of our unique natural environment. Making a practical difference—that's what recognition through the Voice is about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After the Prime Minister's speech at Garma, Senator Patrick Dodson and I appointed a group of First Nations representatives to guide government through the referendum, working and engagement groups. I can honestly say that in all my years in public life I have never seen people come together with such singularity and purpose, with so much wisdom and experience, and such determination to make a practical difference for the next generation. I also give a special thanks to the expert legal group for their expertise and intellectual rigour. I also want to thank my good friend the special envoy, Senator Dodson, a true fighter. Pat, I want you to know we're all thinking of you at the moment. I acknowledge, too, the leadership, dedication and diligence of the Attorney-General.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Referendum Working Group not only guided government on the constitutional amendment question; they also guided government on the design principles of the Voice. Those principles are that the Voice will give independent advice to the parliament and the government; be chosen by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people based on the wishes of local communities; be representative of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities; be gender balanced and include youth and, of course, people from the Torres Strait; be empowering, community led, inclusive, respectful and culturally informed; be accountable and transparent; work alongside existing organisations and traditional structures; not have a program delivery function; and not have a veto power over this parliament. I reiterate: it'll be a Voice that will ensure women's voices are heard, because it will be gender balanced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the event of a successful referendum, there will be a process involving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, the parliament and the broader public to settle the Voice design, including links with regions. Legislation to establish a Voice will then go through the normal parliamentary processes to ensure thorough scrutiny. Everyone agrees that the Voice needs to be connected to the grassroots communities. It's why regional voices that can plug into the national Voice are so important and why investments set by the former Liberal government for regional arrangements remain in the budget. The referendum will work to link the national Voice in at the regional level in a way that works for local communities and will make sure there is the process of talking with local First Nations people first. We will build on the progress that has been made by states and territories, we will build on the important foundational work done by Calma and Langton, and we will build on the vital listening and respect for local communities that was laid down by the Uluru dialogues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now want to speak briefly on the joint select committee process. I thank all members and senators—particularly the chair, Senator Green—for their work. The parliamentary joint select committee heard some powerful evidence from a range of witnesses—evidence about the importance of constitutional recognition, evidence from legal experts, and evidence on how the Voice would make a practical difference on the ground. On the wording of the proposed amendments, expert after expert told the committee that the amendment is constitutionally sound. Former Chief Justice of the High Court Robert French said there was low risk or no risk. Bret Walker said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… somehow jamming the courts from here to kingdom come as a result of this enactment, is really too silly for words.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the Voice will be able to make representations to the executive government. Tom Calma spoke of how important this was, saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… we have many programs the executive government delegate to implement themselves that don't require parliamentary intervention , so that's why it's important to work with the executive government and the bureaucrats particularly on how to implement a lot of their programs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Roy Ah-See reiterated that, saying:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I think it's critical and essential that this Voice has direct communications to the executive …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tom and Roy are both correct: the Voice should be able to make representations to the executive government. The purpose of the Voice is to improve outcomes for our people. It is the executive government that makes policies about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, it is the parliament that passes laws about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and it is the executive government that implements them. There is agreement on this from Ken Wyatt. He says it's too late after the party room meetings, and it's too late after the legislation has been put into parliament, and that is why the Voice should be able to speak with the executive government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe the constitutional amendment before the parliament takes the right form. It's symbolic and practical. It recognises 65,000 years of Australian history. It makes our system of government stronger. It makes a practical difference on the ground. It improves people's lives. It is constitutionally sound and sets the balance right. The Solicitor-General's opinion makes it clear. He says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The proposed section 129 is not just compatible with the system of representative and responsible government prescribed by the constitution, but an enhancement of that system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is from the Solicitor-General, and we have taken his advice very carefully. He also said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A core rationale underpinning the proposed amendment is to facilitate more effective input by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in public discussion and debate about governmental and political matters relating to them … it seeks to rectify a distortion in the existing system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Solicitor-General's advice is very important. Yet this is not enough for those hell-bent on dashing the hopes of a people. It is not enough of those hell-bent on stoking division. It is not enough for those trying to play politics with an issue that should be above partisan politics. The government believes we have the right amendment to proceed; we have the right rigorous process that has listened to the whole range of views. I encourage every single member of this parliament to support the Constitution alteration without amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to conclude by quoting a passage from the Uluru Statement from the Heart:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Proportionally, we are the most incarcerated people on the planet. We are not an innately criminal people. Our children are aliened from their families at unprecedented rates. This cannot be because we have no love for them. And our youth languish in detention in obscene numbers. They should be our hope for the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These dimensions of our crisis tell plainly the structural nature of our problem. This is the torment of our powerlessness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We seek constitutional reforms to empower our people and take a rightful place in our own country. When we have power over our destiny our children will flourish. They will walk in two worlds and their culture will be a gift to their country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's get this done together, and let's move Australia forward for everyone.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms McKENZIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:18</span>):  It is with some sadness and disappointment that I rise to speak against the proposed Constitution Alteration (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice) 2023. We all come to this place from different lives, with different personal and professional experiences and from different parts of this great wide land.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I represent the people of the Mornington Peninsula, home to the Bunurong and Boonwurrung people. Their land encapsulates roughly 8,000 square kilometres of the Victorian coastline and hinterlands from today's city down to the sea. Before the arrival of the white man, it was a small population, estimated by local historian Malcolm Gordon to number somewhere between 250 and 500. But their connection to and dependence on the land was constant, as Mr Gordon writes in A Never Ending Journey, his recently published history of the Mornington Peninsula. The Bunurong and Boonwurrung settled on the land in an organised way. The constant movement over their land for economic purposes was no different in concept from the movement of workers on the early pastoral holdings and settler farms. While population estimates are conservative, it is accepted that within a decade of pastoralists' arrival in the mid-1830s fewer than 100 Indigenous men and women remained.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, the Indigenous people of the Mornington Peninsula include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders from across the nation. It makes for a warm, inclusive, wise, curious and open community with remarkable cultural leaders, like Peter Aldenhoven and Lionel Lauch, and those who embody that warmth and welcome in their every breath, like Uncle John McLean and Aunty Helen Bnads. I'm grateful for their advice and guidance, as I am to those who have agreed to meet with me across Flinders to discuss their passions regarding the Voice on all sides and from all perspectives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I equally thank those who have met with me here in Canberra—like Empowered Communities, who showed me that diverse, unique governance models can produce remarkable results in some places. I thank Dean Parkin, campaign director of Yes 23, for his persistence, hope, wisdom and graceful desperation for something, anything, to disrupt the pattern of failure in our combined attempts to close the gap. And I especially thank Mark Textor, Tony Nutt and my friends Julian Leeser and Greg Craven for leading a debate amongst conservatives which helps us all to see the need for constitutional recognition of our First Nations peoples and the urgency of level-headed and full-hearted endeavours to address the persistent disadvantage suffered by our Indigenous peoples.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I come to this place as someone whose first academic and professional experience was in constitutional law. An avid student of it, I became a research assistant to Greg Craven at the University of Melbourne and studied both Australian and international constitutional law, and then worked for years at the Centre for Comparative Constitutional Studies before I came to my first job in this place as an adviser to the Commonwealth Attorney-General with responsibility for constitutional law, coinciding with the 1999 referendum. With that start in mind, I have read widely about the Voice and have had the benefit of conversations with parliamentarians and legal experts of all persuasions, many of whom have been leaders in the pursuit of a voice to parliament—a notion which, I remind this chamber, has been led by the coalition for the last decade. I conclude from those discussions and wide reading that the choice to embody a voice in the Australian Constitution in its current format, including with reference to the executive government, of imprecise operation and purpose, is a misfounded one—one which carries profound constitutional and legal risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Constitution is not, as suggested by the Prime Minister, a document of spirit and morality, when he insists on calling it the nation's birth certificate and our founding document, like it carries the mysticism of Australian culture in its 128 provisions. It is, and was always intended to be, a plain and pragmatic document. My friend the member for Menzies cited its recognised plainness in the dissenting report of the Joint Select Committee on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice Referendum. There, he noted the Parliamentary Education Office's commentary on the Constitution, as we parliamentarians give it out to Australian school students:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's Constitution contains little of the soaring rhetoric which is familiar in the constitutions of many other lands. That is one of its strengths. It is a practical, matter-of-fact, unpretentious but effective document. As such, it reflects the pragmatic, no-nonsense attitude which we like to think is among the most attractive features of the Australian character.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Australian Constitution the founders, combining what they hoped was the best of the United Kingdom and United States systems of government, brought six sparring colonies into an uneasy truce. But it was accepted that the Commonwealth government would be given power over such administrative measures as lighthouses, stamps, the recording of the weather and determining our national weights and measures. Yes, section 51 also included broader concepts like defence, at a time where no known nation had ever experienced a world war, and external affairs, when such activity largely comprised sending telegraphs to London.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Constitution gave the High Court original jurisdiction over its interpretation—a power it has exercised for 120 years—with many different interpretative methodologies at its disposal to suit both the times and the perspectives of its various judges. As the last arbiter of legal matters in Australia, that is indeed its duty—the steady and careful evolution of the law in Australia. But it has not always done so in what might be called a predictable or linear manner. Nor can any of us with any certainty foresee what the High Court might read into the proposed words of section 129 in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is worth remembering that for the first 20 years the High Court interpreted the Constitution consistent with the spirit in which it had been founded, giving preference to the powers of the states over the newly formed Commonwealth. Then one day in August 1920 the High Court changed its interpretive methodology dramatically, replacing the implied doctrines of the immunity of instrumentalities and the reserved powers of the states with an approach of strict literalism, insisting that the words of the Constitution should be interpreted in their literal sense, not consistent with the founders' intentions, and indeed be given the broadest interpretation possible. Of course, it was not a dramatic move, as great moments of apparent spontaneous ideological revolution rarely are. Thirty years ago I spent a cold Canberra winter in the National library by Lake Burley Griffin, steadily ploughing my way through Sir Isaac Isaacs's personal papers and handwritten notebooks in which he plotted a course through the jurisprudence of the High Court from 1906 to 1920 to persuade, cajole and win over his brethren until one day the High Court dropped its fidelity to the doctrines which operated to preserve the powers and influences of the states. And the rest, from the application of the federal award to the railway engineers of Western Australia to the very bright lights in this grand chamber, is history.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been equally determinative twists and turns in the interpretive approach of the High Court since the engineers' case, and roaring debate between jurists and judges alike about whether these twists and turns were right. Former High Court Justice Michael McHugh highlighted the impact of the court's interpretive leaps had had on Australia's political journey and system of government without a single constitutional amendment. In the 2007 Hal Wootten lecture at the University of New South Wales, Justice McHugh said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If many High Court cases had been decided the other way—and many lawyers agree that they could reasonably have been decided the other way—Australia would be a very different country politically from what it is today. The States would be as important—perhaps more so—than the Commonwealth. State Premiers would vie with the Prime Minister for political importance. Federal laws could not bind the States and their employees. Nor, in most cases, could the operation of federal laws extend into internal State matters … Trade practices legislation would not be able to deal with commercial transactions taking place solely within a State … Television and radio might well be controlled by the States, not the Commonwealth. So would company law. Australians would be subjected to both State and federal income taxes, as they were until 1942. There would only be one bank—the Commonwealth Bank, the private banks having been nationalized … The Communist Party would be banned. The Franklin River would not have been saved …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the protestations of some of the best contemporary constitutional legal minds in the country, of the likes of Bret Walker SC, Professor Cheryl Saunders and Solicitor-General Stephen Donaghue, my heart and head rest with the well-argued warnings of Greg Craven as with the concessions of former justices Kenneth Hayne and Robert French that ultimately, were the High Court to conclude there were a duty on the executive government to consult the Voice as a result of the proposed section 129(ii), it would bring the government to a halt and make government unworkable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No right-minded lawyer or even non-lawyer could reasonably look at this bill, the explanatory memorandum, the joint select parliamentary committee, the Indigenous Voice codesign process, the 2018 parliamentary committee process or this second reading debate and conclude that the words in section 129(ii) as drafted were meant to have no meaningful effect, impact or disruption on the operation of the executive government. Indeed, many of those in favour of the current wording insist disruption is exactly what is intended. Provision 129(ii) as written will, whether now or in five or 10 or 20 years time, be interpreted as being intended to have meaningful effect on the operation of the executive government of Australia. Who knows what that meaningful effect will be? I do not. The shadow minister for Indigenous Australians, who has spent her adult life fighting for improved outcomes for Indigenous Australians, does not. The shadow Attorney-General and the Leader of the Opposition do not. Truthfully, the Minister for Indigenous Australians, the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister do not know either.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I respect and accept that this legislation and the Voice it proposes comes from not only a well-meaning but a necessary place. I am firmly committed to the recognition of Australia's First Nations peoples in the Australian Constitution. It was Prime Minister John Howard who in 2007 promised a referendum to formally recognise Indigenous Australians in our Constitution; their history as the first inhabitants of our country; their unique heritage, culture and languages; and their special, though not separate, place within a reconciled indivisible nation. Prime Minister Howard committed to enlisting wide community support for a yes vote, a noble aim which seemed to be shared by all just a year ago, but not since.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In his final Boyer lecture in December 2022, Noel Pearson, the man who has had more influence over public policy in Australia affecting Indigenous Australians than any other in the last two decades, gave us all wise counsel when he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… I am convinced the referendum on Indigenous Australian recognition should not be understood as yes alliance versus no alliance, conservatives versus progressives, left versus right, us versus them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These words were spoken a mere five months ago. They may as well have been a lifetime ago. Whatever happens at the referendum later this year, I do hope that we all, whatever side we sit on for whatever reasons, continue to be kind and respectful of each other's individual choices. The Constitution belongs to all of us—</span>

It was a magical night. Families came out in spite of the cold. There were thousands of people enjoying all that Penrith has to offer. I congratulate Gai Hawthorn and all of the team of Penrith CBD Corporation for putting on this really special family show. Local businesses, organisations and groups were involved. Everything about Penrith was all in this one space. There was live entertainment and local dance groups. The kids enjoyed everything. It's a reminder of how much we missed over those last couple of years, but it's also a reminder that Penrith and my community of Lindsay have the best community spirit in the country.</span>

My guessing competition lolly jar was a hit, and my team is busily working away at who will be the winner of that. I can't wait to announce that. One of my favourite things is Aussie flags. The kids love these, and I absolutely love the Penrith festival.</span>

Little kids simply coming home from school have had their lives changed forever because of this terrible incident. As a dad, I know there is no greater fear than our kids getting hurt. Our thoughts go out to all those involved in the accident, their parents, teachers, friends and the entire Exford Primary School community. But, as is so often the case, the worst of circumstances brought out the best in us, from the tradies and bystanders who rushed to help at the scene to our heroic first responders, local police, CFA and SES crews, the doctors and nurses at the Royal Children's Hospital and Sunshine Hospital, and the good people across our community of Hawke, who have made meals, collected donations and lent a hand or a hug. They are the best of us, and we are so appreciative.</span>

I read it today because it's more prescient than ever, given the impact of last week's budget on mental health services.</span>

Right now there are many young Australians just like me who are trying to navigate a broken mental health system—a system that has failed many of us. We are told to reach out and, when we do, we are told to wait. Too many of us have been told 'there is nothing we can do for you' when we are in crisis. This causes us to go to extremes to be heard, which we should never have to do, let alone consider. If we do survive and if we do receive support, being in this system can create lifelong trauma and a loss of hope when hope is most vital.</span>

We need a system that treats us holistically and with compassion—a system that doesn't just help after we have already gone through extreme trauma and tragedy, only to create more. Together, the government, young people and mental healthcare professionals can work together to improve and guide mental health in accomplishing an inclusive system.'</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  In a consequential meeting on Saturday the President of the United States and our Prime Minister signed a statement of intent to advance climate cooperation. This new compact affirms the position of climate and clean energy as the third pillar of the alliance, alongside defence and economic cooperation. It's a very significant development. It signals that we will work with the United States for our private sectors, resources and industrial strength to spur the diversification of clean energy supply chains throughout the Indo-Pacific.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note that the US President plans to ask congress to add Australia as a domestic source under the Defense Production Act. Doing so would streamline technological and industrial base collaboration, strengthen the implementation of AUKUS and build new opportunities for US investment in the purchase of Australian critical minerals and other strategic sectors. I keep in close contact with my US colleagues congressmen Joe Courtney and Mike Gallagher, who have been working on an amendment to add Australia and the UK to the Defense Production Act. I understand that they're going to push it again. Our relationship and alliance have never been stronger. I welcome this historic breakthrough.</span>

The CFMMEU in Queensland has just had enough of the rubbish that comes from you people. We've had enough. It's not only from you people but from the people over here as well. There's no in-between. You'll go down your pathway and close the coalmines, unless you're a lying hypocrite, of course—and that's highly possible and probable. We've had discussions with the CFMMEU at the highest level in Queensland. We're not taking it any longer, my friend, so we'll report you and your name to those people.</span>

This great man in his late 90s has produced yet again the Bradfield scheme—the great scheme and dream of the Australian people to water inland Australia and provide a wonderful future of opportunity, freedom, hope and excitement.</span>

I am so proud of what we have delivered for my community, cleaning up the mess left behind by the previous government. We have strengthened Medicare and lowered the costs of medicines. We have put nurses back into nursing homes and secured a 15 per cent pay rise for aged-care workers. I'm so proud to be a member of the party that respects workers. We've supported over 6,000 casual mine workers, many of which are in my electorate, by ensuring that they get the same long service leave as permanent workers. We are supporting families, with over $14 billion in cost-of-living relief delivered in this month's budget.</span>

I am getting on with the job and will keep working hard for everyone across the Hunter electorate, as we all will in this place. I look forward to rising in another year's time to celebrate even more accomplishments, more promises kept and more progress towards a better future for all Australians.</span>

Eighteen thousand hectares of land was burnt, several homes were lost, and livestock and native species tragically perished. Farmers have lost feed, stock and a huge amount of fencing.

While this event has been declared a natural disaster and some assistance has been made available, the joint New South Wales and federal government $75,000 special disaster grants still have not been activated. </span>

While the previous New South Wales government could have activated this support, it failed to do so. All the while, the hurt and the heartbreak in the district continues. I have contacted the new New South Wales Premier and requested that these crucial grants be activated. Seventy-five thousand dollars can really help with new fencing, feed and other provisions. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:41</span>):  After a year in government, this Albanese government has delivered a budget which has measures in it that make life easier for so many people across the country and in my electorate of Dunkley. One of the big issues in my electorate is access to health care, access to bulk-billing GPs, being able to afford medicines when you need them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Access to GPs was such a big problem in my electorate that Rachael from St Mary Medical Centre in Carrum Downs was giving evidence to a Senate inquiry last year about how to recruit GPs to her practice and to my community. As soon as we were elected, we did the work. We changed the classification of the Frankston area so that clinics could recruit more GPs. And now, with the budget, we have tripled the bulk-billing incentive in the largest increase in the 40-year history of Medicare: 74,000 people in my electorate will benefit from that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Rachael said, when Minister Kearney and I visited her and the amazing doctors at St Mary on Friday, this will be a big game changer for the number of people who come through their clinic and the number of people they can give better healthcare to. That's what it is all about: making sure you can get health care based on your Medicare card, not your credit card. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wide Bay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  It's 1944 and two-year-old Suzi Smeed is being smuggled out of a Hungarian ghetto into hiding. In three days, her grandparents will be on a cattle train to Auschwitz—a place they will never leave. Separated from her parents, the orphanage that was her temporary refuge is destroyed by bombing. Suzi was hidden by good people trying to keep her alive. Her desperately searching mother did find her—surviving, just, in a barn. Her beautiful red hair had fallen out and she was covered in sores. The clothes she wore, when taken away, more recognisable than her physical features. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is Suzi Smeed's harrowing start to life, revealed in her book <span style="font-style:italic;">The Courage to Care</span>. Her memoire details her survival of the Hungarian holocaust and fleeing to Australia as a refugee with her mum and her then successful life in Australia. Now in her 80s, Suzi visits schools to educate children about the dangers of prejudice, racism and discrimination. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The telling of her story is a testament to Susie's strength and commitment to condemn anti-Semitism and reminds us of events that must never be repeated. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:44</span>):  I was proud to celebrate the first anniversary of the Albanese Labor government by doing what I enjoy the most: speaking to the constituents of Holt at mobile offices across the electorate. Every chat was delightful—not surprising given that the government got on the job from day one and has delivered policies which support every single Australian.</span>

I was not surprised to hear this, given this government has worked hard to ensure strong foundations for everyone by delivering 300,000 fee-free TAFE places, cheaper child care, a $33.6 billion investment in our aged-care system, cheaper medicines and targeted energy relief for families and businesses.</span>

Thank you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  Last week—would you believe?—was National Volunteer Week, and where would we be without volunteers in this country? The Australian Bureau of Statistics in 2021 found that nearly three million Australians—three million!—did unpaid voluntary work in that year alone, and we want to thank each and every one of them for what they do. In fact, my office took the opportunity to put out the call for any organisation that wanted to have certificates of appreciation printed and sent to those organisations for their volunteers, and that was taken up very strongly. In fact, we did over 500 certificates, and we did it for one simple purpose, and that is to say thank you: thank you to those volunteers for what they do each and every day.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I managed to hand out some personally at the Hervey Bay and District Senior Citizens Club and also at the Rotary Club of Bundaberg Sunrise, where I met Val Dempsey. Val was the 2022 Senior Australian of the Year. She has volunteered for St John Ambulance for more than 50 years, and I've got to tell you: you don't need a radio on when Val's in the room. She is incredibly entertaining. She has a lot to say and is a wonderful volunteer from right here in Canberra.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So to all of our volunteers—from our surf lifesavers who are saving lives to those who are working in palliative care when Australians are in their most difficult time, and from those who work with the guide dogs to the P&amp;Cs at schools—on behalf of the entire parliament we simply say this: thank you so much.</span>

We established a royal commission into robodebt after the previous government chose to run this shameful scheme, and we wiped robodebt for almost 200,000 Australians. We passed legislation to establish a National Anti-Corruption Commission to restore integrity and trust in our national institutions. We supported increases to the national minimum wage and significant funded increases for aged-care workers. We've provided 180,000 fee-free TAFE places, with 300,000 more on the way. We have delivered historic cuts to the cost of medicines and, from the beginning of July, will deliver cheaper early childhood education across Bean and the country. And we have invested half a billion dollars towards the nine national collecting institutions, addressing the decade of chronic underfunding inflicted by the former government.</span>

Today I wish to acknowledge the tireless contributions that our volunteers in the election of Braddon make to each and every one of their respective communities. Not a minute would go by, whether it's day or night, when one of these volunteers is not having a positive life-changing or life-saving impact on someone in the region. Last week I was lucky enough to catch up with some of the incredible volunteers at the Waratah-Wynyard Council. I know similar events were held right across Braddon to acknowledge the contribution and generosity of all our volunteers right along the coast.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Volunteers form the beating heart of our nation, but, unfortunately, the COVID pandemic has taken its toll on many organisations and the number of volunteers is in decline. The volunteers that I met last week all had one thing in common: they all agreed that they got back far more than they ever gave. No matter your interests—whether in sport, the environment, health, the care sector, the arts, youth mentoring, emergency services or animal welfare, and the list goes on—there's a volunteer organisation that could use your help today. It's good for you, and it's vital for the ongoing prosperity of our nation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  It's been one year since we were elected to this place and formed a new government. Reflecting on this government's achievements, I start by asking myself: what do we need for a progressive, fair, functioning society in 2023? We need trust in government, an educated population, a healthy population, a safety net to help those who need help, gender equity, action on climate change, investment in the future and pride in our country.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To restore trust in government, we have legislated the National Anti-Corruption Commission. In education, we have provided for 300,000 fee-free TAFE places. In health, we have cheaper medicines and record investment in Medicare. We have supported record wage rises for aged-care workers and for those on a minimum wage, cheaper child care for millions of families, and gender-sensitive workplace and health system changes to address systemic inequity. Facing climate change square on, we have legislated targets, a safeguard mechanism with teeth and the $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund, to capitalise on the opportunity that a green energy economy presents. We have invested in local infrastructure and the NBN, as well as in the arts, so that Australian stories can be told. And, while we are renovating a neglected nation at home, our Prime Minister, foreign minister, trade minister and others are making us proud again on the international stage. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  I rise to pay tribute to an extraordinary Australian, Rex Hall AFSM, who was honoured last week with life membership of the SA Volunteer Firefighters Museum. This honour follows Rex being awarded the CFS chief officer's commendation in January of this year, as only the second person in the agency to receive that acknowledgement. Late last year Rex was also recognised for 60 years of service to the Naracoorte Group CFS. I've worked with Rex in recent years to help secure federal government funding for the SA Volunteer Firefighters Museum, which includes, amongst other things, a memorial to fallen South Australian volunteer firefighters, who have made the ultimate sacrifice defending their communities.</span>

                  </span>The museum was first conceived over 20 years ago, and Rex has led its development from a fledgling idea to becoming a memorial and museum site. His commitment to preserving the culture and history of volunteer firefighting in South Australia has seen him published four times over his 20 years of research. Rex, who has held the position of chairperson on the museum committee since its inception, didn't stand for re-election this term due to his ailing health. Last week was National Volunteer Week, and I can't think of a more dedicated, passionate volunteer within my community of Barker. From receiving the Australian Fire Service Medal in 1994 to earning these recent accolades, Rex deserves recognition for his outstanding commitment to community service. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

That has definitely been a truism of the Albanese Labor government, a government now a year and a day old. It may speak a little to what this government replaced, but it was always a proud moment to begin a large number of my contributions in this chamber by simply stating the fact that the passage of the legislation being debated at the time was part of the government fulfilling another election commitment, whether it be the introduction of the National Anti-Corruption Commission; whether it be making child care cheaper for thousands of parents throughout Australia—7,200 in Spence—or whether it be the establishment of Jobs and Skills Australia, a body created after the Albanese Labor government held its Jobs and Skills Summit alongside many local roundtables in summits across the country, such as the one I held in my electorate of Spence.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">JSA has been designed and tasked with combating Australia's skills shortages, both the ones that exist now and the ones that will exist in the future. The establishment of the National Reconstruction Fund Corporation will help to revitalise and reinvigorate Australian manufacturing. For too long, we as a nation were in the doldrums, stuck in neutral at best or moving steadily backward at worst. The Albanese Labor government has taken off the handbrake on progress for Australia. I look forward to being part of its second year in office and many more to come.</span>

The Labor government has reduced funding for the Redlands from the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program, which has been instrumental in supporting numerous projects in the area. This year's allocation for Redland City Council will be $716,000 less than what was provided in the last coalition budget. Furthermore, this critical funding will not be renewed beyond this allocation, passing the cost of these important projects to ratepayers. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Stronger Communities Program has had a significant impact in supporting grassroots organisations, community and sporting groups. Amongst many grant applications this year, we were able to seed $20,000 through this funding stream for the North Stradbroke Island rugby league club to purchase new shade sails and $4,500 dollars for Multicap's Capalaba community hub to acquire new outdoor furniture and a barbecue. Regrettably, the Labor government has decided to eliminate this competitive local investment model.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor government has also scrapped the coalition's Building Better Regions Fund program and replaced it with the Growing Regions fund. This change has resulted in the Moreton Bay islands in my electorate being excluded from this funding stream, due to changes in eligibility conditions. This is particularly heartbreaking given community led efforts in 2017 to get this funding made applicable to the islands. This week I've written to the minister seeking to have this decision reversed. I strongly encourage the government to restore this important funding for my community. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It's been a year that the adults have been back in charge. From day one, we on this side of the House got straight back to work to lift the wages of hardworking Australians. If you want to know what it would be like under those opposite, they are still fighting against wage rises for those on the minimum wage. They are still fighting against all of the policies that we've brought in, including the wages for our hardworking workers in the aged-care forum. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side of the House introduced the National Anti-Corruption Commission, a great Labor reform, and what did they do? They put an exposure draft on the website. That doesn't cut it. We passed climate laws. We put tax relief in for electric vehicles. We passed the safeguard mechanism. What did they do? Ten years of dither and delay and climate denial. We have worked hard to restore Australia's place in international forums. From the Prime Minister to the foreign minister, we have worked hard not to play domestic politics with national security issues but to treat international fora and our international relationships with the respect that they deserve. We made the largest investment in Medicare, tripling the bulk-billing incentive. What did the Leader of the Opposition do? He wanted to put in a GP tax every time Australians needed to go and see a doctor. It's been a year of hard work, but we are just getting started in the Albanese Labor government.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fairfax</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:57</span>):  It is 12 months since Labor won government, and, while their hubris is on full display and they're very happy, hardworking Australians are the ones who are paying the price. Take Darren Pilcher, for instance, a small-business owner and a family man who I popped in to see last week, together with the shadow Treasurer and the shadow employment and workplace relations minister. Darren has been running the Beach Street Deli cafe now for over eight years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since Labor came to government, when it comes to Darren, do you think his life is easier or harder? It's harder. It's a lot harder. Electricity bills have gone up by over 60 per cent for Darren and gas over 50 per cent. I tell you, Mr Speaker, as a cafe that makes a fantastic eggs benny, when the price of eggs goes up by 30 per cent it also hits them hard. But Darren doesn't pass these costs on to his consumers, because he knows his consumers are also doing it tough. They shop less, and they spend less when they do shop. Darren's story is the story of middle Australia. It is why Labor's legacy has already been cast. It's a legacy of working poor.</span>

It is about health care. It is about looking after families. We know that there is a lot to do. There is still so much more to be done, but I am so proud to live in a community where we have been able to deliver GP access and cheaper medicines. But, for me, this is the big stand-out, and I want to thank the Prime Minister for it. The lot over on that side dragged my community through the courts on PFAS. I'd just like to say that last Friday this government settled a class action on the very same day. It is an absolute sea change in how government should be done.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's the memo for the opposition: good government is about delivering. It's about delivering for people who don't have enough, people who want more and people who are prepared to work hard. Labor get that, and we will continue to work hard for all Australians, unlike those opposite, who just want to turn up, get their names ticked off and take home the pay packet. Well, it is a lot more than that when you're in good government. That's the difference. So I again thank the Prime Minister and I say to Australians: Thank you for your faith and trust in our government. We will continue to work hard for you. We want to continue to deliver. We understand what it's like to really—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a schoolboy, Tony Staley was drawn to drama, history, poetry and debating. He thought those interests might suit a life in the church. But, when he asked his school chaplain about this, the answer he got was, according to him, 'For God's sake, man; don't go into it!' So, instead, he chose politics—still plenty of drama and debating, poetry on the good days and, on the best days, making history.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">After studying law and politics, he taught at the University of Melbourne. In his eulogy at last week's state funeral, Tony's former student Petro Georgiou spoke of his indelible recollection of Tony Staley's passion and intellect: 'For many undergraduates like me, he brought politics and democratic values to life.' Then, in 1970, he swapped theory for practice. He spent the next decade in parliament in pursuit of 'the ideas, the philosophy, the passion, the commitment and the courage which are at the heart of great government and great politics.'</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Commitment and courage are recurring themes when people talk about Tony Staley—his policy determination, his hard strategic edge and his courage not only in holding to his convictions but in his personal life, miraculously surviving a horrific car accident in 1990 and spending the remainder of his years walking with calipers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say this on a personal level: every time I ran into Tony Staley, he was encouraging, he was delightful and he was a gentleman. He was someone who regarded the pursuit of politics as being an honourable profession, and he was indeed an honourable man. Many Liberal Party figures from the era that served with him have spoken of Tony's talents as an administrator, campaigner and unifier. But I can think of no greater tribute to his political skill than the fact that Graham Richardson admired his 'audacity'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tony's greatest legacy was his role as communications minister in the Fraser government. It was while he was minister that he established the SBS, an institution that continues to simultaneously showcase our great multicultural nation and nourish it. He was also a vocal supporter of the ABC and of community radio, which he saw as a profoundly democratic service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tony Staley used to say that politics was a great job but a bad life. But nobody, least of all Tony himself, would have called his life anything but full and well spent. On behalf of the government and on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, we offer our sincere and heartfelt sympathy to his family, to his friends and to his colleagues. May he rest in peace.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AKI" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DUTTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dickson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:04</span>):  I join with the Prime Minister and thank him for his fine words in honouring the life of Anthony Allan Staley AO. A graduate of law, two of Tony's passions were drama and politics. Both stages were open to him in life. Indeed, he was even encouraged by an English actor to pursue the former, but after completing a master's degree in politics and working as a senior lecturer at the University of Melbourne he chose the tougher political stage. Following a brief fling with the Labor Party as a young man, Tony saw the light and joined the Liberal Party in the 1960s. In 1970 he was elected in the seat of Chisholm at a by-election, joining John Gorton's government. He would go on to proudly serve the people of Chisholm for a decade. In his maiden speech of 1971 the mind of an intellectual man was on show. Tony nominated a number of issues that meant a lot to him, relating to public order, protest, universities, freedom of speech, and education. Indeed, his observation on protecting democracy has lasting and amplified relevance across the Western world today. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In time of peace, wishful thinking and dreaming will not keep institutions alive and well. They must be defended as any human institution must be defended when it is under attack</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Upon being re-elected in 1972, Tony found himself in opposition with Billy Snedden as the Liberal leader. The following year he was promoted to shadow parliamentary secretary to the Leader of the Opposition. Tony had a deep personal regard for Snedden's honesty and for his decency, but he lost faith in his leader's ability to lead the Liberals and joined a growing chorus who threw in their lot with Malcolm Fraser. Tony described the events as 'difficult and unpleasant', but he never regretted his actions, later saying. 'I'm not prepared to be the sort of politician who won't stand up for his beliefs.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tony's backing of Fraser was a pivotal decision. Author and journalist Paul Kelly acknowledged that without Staley's decision Fraser would not have won the Liberal leadership at the time he did and consequently would probably not have won it before the Liberals were returned to office. Kelly noted that Tony was unlike his party colleagues, describing him as a theorist and noting that he enjoyed philosophising. Such traits came naturally to the academically minded Tony, a man who loved poetry and the classics. If Tony was a atypical in this regard, he was also exceptional in being a politician who shaped Australia's political history in two pivotal ways: first, in helping to lift Fraser into the Liberal leadership and eventual prime ministership and, second, in helping to bring down Gough Whitlam's Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Interviewed in 2015, Tony acknowledged that Fraser benefited when Whitlam, post the dismissal, focused his attacks on Governor-General John Kerr. In Malcolm Fraser's government, Tony proved to be a steady hand and an effective minister, first as the Minister for the Capital Territory, then as the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Arts and, finally, as the Prime Minister rightly points out, as a very successful and effective Minister for Post and Telecommunications. The mettle of the man was evident not only in his political career but also in how he handled his personal setbacks. Even after that devastating car accident in 1990, which almost killed him and left him partially paralysed and in terrible pain, Tony never complained. He described his first steps eight months after being hit by the drunk driver as 'big moments in a little life'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After leaving office, Tony served as federal president of the Liberal Party between 1993 and 1999. There is no question that his steadfast leadership in dark times was a factor in helping the coalition return to government in 1996. Tony told Liberal Party members that if he could come back from the dead then so could the Liberal Party. He said: 'Life, like politics, is about turning adversity to advantage.' As Tony finished his presidency, then Prime Minister John Howard described him as a great servant of the Liberal Party who always put the party first. Howard highlighted Tony's three great qualities: his immense personal courage, his great sense of humour and his considerable grace and eloquence. Testimony to Tony's achievements, he was made an Officer of the Order of Australia in 2007 for his service to politics, to the telecommunications and arts sectors, and to the development of the Liberal Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were so pleased to be able to visit Tony in Melbourne on the days before his passing. I pay tribute to all his children—in particular, Sam, who set up camp there beside his father and provided loyalty right to the end, as did all his children. He was as sharp and erudite then as he always was. We will all miss him, and I know he'll be missed by many in the Liberal Party and others more widely who were touched by his life and his contribution. Tony Staley's service to the Liberal Party was the gold standard, and the Liberal Party has been enriched by his service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say thank you to the member for Maribyrnong, representing the Prime Minister at the funeral last week. There was an occasion for each of Tony's children to stand up and one outdo the next, as they provided their eulogy—their own touching words in relation to their father, their love of him and the way in which he contributed to their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the coalition, I offer my heartfelt condolences to Tony's family, his friends and colleagues. As Tony always finished a conversation, God bless. May he rest in peace.</span>

It's only been a year under an Albanese government, and middle Australia is hurting, with the typical Australian family at least $25,000 worse off as the cost of living worsens. This is despite personal promises from the Prime Minister, before the election, of cheaper power, cheaper mortgages and that families would be better off. Why do Australians always pay more when Labor breaks its promises?</span>

And what we've been doing is implementing that agenda. As a direct result of what this government has done, one million families—1.2 million, to be precise—will pay less for child care from 1 January. As a result of what we put in the budget, tripling the bulk-billing incentive, 11 million Australians will pay less to see a doctor. As a result of what we have done already in the first four months of this year, Australians paid $76 million less for their prescriptions because of our cheaper medicines plan. Because of our budget, six million Australians will pay less for their medicines in the future. Four hundred and eighty thousand Australians will go through their TAFE courses for free as a result of our policies, and 180,000 are already doing just that. Five million Australians, as a result of the legislation that they opposed, to provide $3 billion, together with states and territories—they voted against providing relief from power prices. As a direct result of that, one million small businesses will benefit—again, a measure that those opposite voted against. 3.7 million small businesses will be able to access an expanded instant asset write-off. 3.7 million small businesses will be eligible for a tax incentive if they upgrade to more energy efficient equipment and facilities.</span>

They deserve more than just our thanks. They deserved a pay rise, and we provided $11.3 billion in our budget to make sure that 250,000 of them would get just that.</span>

The Quad Leaders' Summit that was held in Hiroshima on Saturday evening, that I convened, was the third in-person meeting of what is a diplomatic partnership of four great democracies determined to shape a better future for our shared region. For the first time, we issued a vision statement, setting out our shared vision for the region and the future of the Quad, reiterating our shared commitment to an open, stable, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific. Our four nations will continue working with ASEAN, the Pacific Islands Forum and the Indian Ocean Rim Association. Our joint statement set out the positive work we're doing together in the region, with clear and practical outcomes from this summit. A clean energy supply chain diversification program. A Quad healthy security partnership, building on the many vaccines that we've provided for the region through the Quad. A Quad partnership for cable connectivity and resilience. A Quad infrastructure fellowships program that will really assist particularly our Pacific island neighbours, and an open radio access network deployment that will mean they can access support for communications in a much more effective way.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is always in Australia's national interest to engage in these meetings, and I thank President Biden, Prime Minister Kishida and Prime Minister Modi for the cooperative way in which they engaged and continue to engage on a day-to-day basis. Australia is determined to invest in our capabilities but also to invest in our relationships and to make Australia more stable and secure at home and more influential in the world, because building and strengthening these ties, nation to nation and in regional groupings, is a key part of how my government is building a stronger foundation for that better future.</span>

One year ago, the Prime Minister promised a $275 cut to electricity bills, but power prices have increased. One year ago, the Prime Minister promised cheaper mortgages, but since then interest rates have risen 10 times. One year ago, the Prime Minister promised no new taxes, but he has already hit the resources sector with a gas tax, the agriculture sector with a farm tax and Aussie truckies with a truck tax. Why do Australians always pay more when Labor breaks its promises?</span>

The government of which she was a part, of course, knew all about introducing new taxes and new revenue measures. They introduced the changes to HECS thresholds and indexation. There was the introduction of the temporary budget repair levy, the reintroduction of fuel excise indexation, increased application charges for partner visas, increased depreciation life for computers and increased charges for visa applications. They introduced a cap on salary sacrificed meals and entertainment, changes to managed investment trusts, changes to the offshore banking unit regime, changes to FIFO workers, changes to tax rules for working holiday-makers, changes to the calculation of work related car expenses and changes to foreign investment fees for real estate and farming. There was the removal of the FTB part A large family supplement, the introduction of no jab, no pay for payments, the cessation of double dipping for paid parental leave.</span>

She said this about the RBA minutes: 'It sounds to me as if they are sounding alarm bells on this budget.' There's only one problem with that: the meeting was the week before the budget. So the RBA governor, apparently, is Nostradamus. It says everything about their catastrophic nonsense, where they carry on with: 'Everything is a catastrophe. Everything's a disaster. Everything's going to go wrong on their watch.' They have nothing constructive to add. But the only person who was more pleased and chuckling about that comment by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was the bloke who's sitting there.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">President Biden and I have signed a historic agreement to advance climate and clean energy action between our countries. We agreed that climate change action is a national security issue. He, indeed, stated on Saturday that this is a new pillar of our alliance—a new, third pillar, indeed. The Climate, Critical Minerals and Clean Energy Transformation Compact is an ambitious agreement. It will expand and diversify our clean energy supply. It will promote the sustainable supply and processing of critical minerals and support the development of clean hydrogen, battery technologies and other clean energy products.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">President Biden also undertook to work with congress to enable Australia to be included as a domestic supplier under the US Defense Production Act. Now, that is critical, because treating Australia as a domestic supplier will allow our industries to benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act. That is worth A$547 billion dollars. That means big opportunities for Australia to build our renewable energy industry and create jobs, including in the hydrogen sector, to boost manufacturing to support emerging industries. The only other country in the world with this designation is Canada.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we'll do this while ensuring our people and businesses can access secure, affordable, renewable energy. What this shows is that the Australia-US alliance continues to go from strength to strength. I look forward to visiting the United States later this year. Of course, President Biden, like other US leaders, will always be a welcome visitor here in Australia. But I thank him very much for the relationship that we have built over the last year. It is in Australia's national interest that we develop those strong personal relationships at a leadership level, and that is something that we have been doing. President Biden is a great friend of Australia, and I welcome the initiatives that arose on Saturday from our bilateral and then from the Quad meeting, which we had later that day.</span>

We have an incredible friendship with each of the countries—with Japan, with the United States, with India—and the G7 nations otherwise obviously share many of our mutual interests and perspectives on the outlook in our region, so it is important that the world hears that there is bipartisan support, as was demonstrated under the AUKUS agreement, brokered by the coalition and signed by the government. It's in our country's best interests to be strong, to provide deterrence, to provide reassurance to our friends in the region, and we continue the bipartisan approach in relation to this very important area of policy that's in the best interests of our country.</span>

Minister for Indigenous Australians, are you aware that life expectancy for homelanded First Australians is just 56. Under the ALP government in Queensland, 36,000 cattle have gone, Torres Strait Island backyard fruit and vegetables have gone, the right to water, dinghy fishing and freehold title have gone. Didn't Dick Smith, according to Macca on Sunday, alert Australia to mass malnutrition following the market garden shutdowns? Eight First Australian MPs, Torres Strait's Vonda Malone and the gulf's Clarence Walden were all ignored. Isn't Sarah Maddison right: the only voice government listens to is its own? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

You are indeed 78 years young!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank you for your question. But I want to recognise the very close relationship that the member for Kennedy has with places like Garawa, Doomadgee and Mornington Island. I very much respect that relationship and I am very conscious, as the member for Kennedy has pointed out, of the huge gap in life expectancy, particularly in the communities that he represents. I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. I know that it is very heartfelt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Constitutional recognition through a voice to parliament is all about making a difference on the ground in communities like those in North Queensland. It is about making sure the voices of Indigenous Australians in remote and regional communities are heard and not ignored, and I think that, when you have a look at the Uluru dialogues and the way in which attention was particularly paid to Queensland, that is very obvious. In fact, recognition through a voice is about making sure communities like those in Far North Queensland, who I know the member for Kennedy cares about, have a say in the policies that impact them and their communities. It is indeed those practical outcomes that the member for Kennedy is very much concerned about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The stark reality is that Indigenous Australians in the remote communities that the member for Kennedy represents experience a shocking and unacceptable gap in life expectancy. Something has to change. More of the same is not good enough. Later this year, all Australians will get a chance to do something about it, and I invite the member for Kennedy to be part of that journey by voting yes for recognition through a voice and giving people like the people in North Queensland a real say.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I finish up by saying that Mayor Andrews and the Yarrabah Council support the Voice, and it is very strong. On the issue of market gardens, I have spoken with the member about this previously, and I look forward to having further conversations with the member for Kennedy about things like market gardens that make a real, practical difference in the lives of First Nations people in North Queensland.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians can be proud of what we've achieved together over the course of the last 12 months. Over the first year of the Albanese Labor government, we have seen the fastest jobs growth of any new government on record—faster than any of the major advanced economies—and the strongest wages growth in more than a decade. These have been defining features of a government dedicated to secure jobs and better pay for our people. These are deliberate design features of our economic policy, because when Australians are under cost-of-living pressures, decent wages are part of the solution, not part of the problem. More jobs and the beginnings of decent wages growth are among Australia's biggest advantages at a time of global uncertainty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The combination of weakness in the global economy combined with higher interest rates here and around the world will slow our economy in the months ahead. We saw some of that in last week's unemployment numbers, but it's a remarkable collective achievement that unemployment has a three in front of it with everything that is coming at us from around the world. Also 330,000 jobs have been created in our first year, more than four times the number of jobs created in the first year of the Abbott government or the Howard government. Jobs growth here has been faster than in the US, Canada, Germany and the UK. Average full-time earnings are now around $1,000 a year higher than they would have been under the sluggish wages growth that we saw under those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In order to get real wages growth we need to see inflation moderate further, and we need strong and sustainable wages growth. That's why the budget was carefully calibrated to take some of the edge off cost-of-living pressures and the CPI next year without adding to inflation. This is why we supported minimum wage increases, funded and supported pay rises for aged-care workers, changed the law to support secure jobs and better pay, made it easier for parents to work more and earn more if they want to, funded TAFE and uni places, invested in industries that will create secure and well-paid jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite continue to say no to decent wages. Nothing would make them happier than another decade of wage stagnation. But on this side of the House we take a different view. When it comes to jobs growth and wages growth, we are delivering so that more hardworking Australians who go to work can provide for their loved ones.</span>

                  </a>  This was a budget for middle Australia: tripling the bulk-billing incentive for families with kids under 16, reducing the cost of medicines, energy price relief, the Household Energy Upgrades Fund, getting more Australians into home ownership sooner, additional TAFE and training places, enhanced liveability in our cities, more affordable early childhood education and care from 1 July, paid parental leave being extended, and superannuation paid on pay day. This was a budget for middle Australia. Those opposite presided over a decade of deliberate wage stagnation and wage suppression, which should disqualify them from asking questions in this place about middle Australia. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also asked to compare and contrast the experience of economic management and budget management under those opposite compared to the experience under us. I appreciate, I am grateful for, the shadow Treasurer almost every day but especially today, because he gives me the opportunity to remind the Australian people of the absolute bin fire of economic irresponsibility which defined those opposite's decade in office. The worst quarter for inflation was the March quarter of last year when they were in office. They handed down a budget which had $39 billion in net new spending when inflation was on the way up. After inflation starts moderating, our budget has a net spend of $20 billion, so half as much spending with an extra $40 billion in savings compared to zero savings in the last budget of those opposite.</span>

                  <span style="font-style:italic;">
                  </span>In the bizarre alternative universe that they inhabit, those opposite want the Australian people to think that our budget, which puts downward pressure on inflation next year, versus their budget, which put upward pressure on inflation last year, is worse. They want to try and distract and hoodwink the Australian people. The markets know better and the economists know better. What the markets and the economists have said since our budget was handed down is that our budget achieves the core objective, which is to take some of the edge off these cost-of-living pressures without adding to inflation. We do that with the energy bill relief that those opposite voted against. We do that with the energy price caps that those opposite voted against. You have absolutely no credibility on middle Australia or anything else to do with it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Health and Aged Care and Deputy Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:39</span>):  I want to thank the member for Hunter for his question. He was so clear, in his promise to his community at the last election, on his commitment to deliver better health care for his community in the Hunter Valley. He promised to reinstate funding that was cut by the Liberal Party to the Hunter after-hours GP service, a nation-leading after-hours service, and he delivered on that promise along with his colleagues the member Patterson, the member for Newcastle the member for Shortland. He promised to reinstate the right of general practices in his community to recruit overseas trained doctors and he delivered on that promise as well. After nine long years of cuts and neglect to Medicare that have made it harder than ever and more expensive to see a doctor, he promised to strengthen Medicare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this month's budget, we delivered on that promise as well, with a $6 billion package of new initiatives to strengthen Medicare along with the largest increase across the board to Medicare rebates in more than 30 years, a $1½ billion boost to indexation that next year, in one year, will deliver a bigger increase to Medicare rebates than the former government delivered in their first seven years of government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the centrepiece of this month's budget are our strengthening Medicare package is $3½ billion dollars to triple the bulk-billing incentive, because, for the Labour Party, bulk-billing is the beating heart of the Medicare system. This will make a huge change to general practice, for in the cities a standard bulk-billed consult will see an increase to GPs of more than a third. The total fee paid to GPs will rise by more than a third. That increase will be even higher in regions like the Hunter Valley. A standard bulk-billed consult in Cessnock, for example, in the Hunter Valley, in the member for Hunter's electorate, will rise by 50 per cent, from $50 to $75. This covers, as the Prime Minister said, more than 11 million Australians, accounting for more than 60 per cent of all activity in general practice, including 88,000 in the member for Hunter's electorate. That's why the College of General Practitioners described this budget as a game changer—particularly the bulk billing. It will be a game changer for millions of mums and dads, who want the confidence that, when their kid gets sick, they can go to a bulk-bill doctor. It will be a game changer for millions of pensioners, self-funded retirees and concession card holders, who need the confidence of bulk-billing. Importantly, it will be a game changer for tens of thousands of practitioners, who after nine years finally see a government in Canberra that values their important work.</span>

Indeed, if you look at the G7 countries and how we're going, our GDP growth of 2.7 per cent—</span>

Our employment growth of 2.9 per cent is—guess what?—higher than Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US. Indeed, in the first 12 months that this government has held office, we have created, on our watch, more jobs than any government on record.

I know that the member for Cunningham, like all on this side of the House, is passionate about building a better future for Australian children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A year ago Australians voted, and they voted for a government that puts Australian families first; a government that believes in giving every child the very best start in life; a government that believes in ensuring primary carers have a choice; a government that values our early childhood education workforce; and a government that recognises that the cost of early childhood education often puts it out of reach for far too many families. The Albanese Labor government is taking action, laying the foundations for a better future. From July, only a few more sleeps away, early childhood education and care will be more affordable for over 1.2 million families across Australia. That includes 265,000 families in rural and regional Australia. What does that mean? In practical terms, it means that a family earning $120,000 a year with one child in early learning will save about $1,700 a year. That's real money, that's real cost of living relief, and that makes a real difference to Australian families. These are vital reforms that will ensure children have access to high-quality, affordable early childhood education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we know that the work doesn't stop after just one year. We've also commenced an ACCC price inquiry and a Productivity Commission review into the broader early childhood education and care sector.</span>

                  </a>  These key pieces of work will help us better understand how the system can become a more sustainable, more affordable early learning system that benefits every single child in Australia. We know that a strong, sustainable and qualified workforce is vital to this system, and that's why we passed the Secure Jobs, Better Pay bill last year, making our industrial relations system fairer for low-paid female-dominated sectors. This government has been working from day one to build an early childhood sector that is of high quality, that is accessible and that is affordable for all Australians, building on the past legacies of a Labor government in introducing the National Quality Framework for all early childhood educators in this country. After just one year, we have already delivered relief for families in early childhood education, and we will continue to deliver a world-class system for our very youngest Australians.</span>

                  </a>  I'm getting to the question. I too would be angry if I had presided over a 2.1 per cent increase. The largest quarterly increase was in March 2022. That was the highest. The highest inflation this century was on their watch, and their response after that quarter in March was to massively increase spending in the vain hope that they would be re-elected in the May 2022 election. That is just a fact. It is a fact that on that budget day they, of course, had a whole lot of new spending but no savings. It's also a fact that we produced two budgets that have produced $40 billion of savings. It's also a fact that we overwhelmingly returned the increase in revenue to the bottom line to take pressure off inflation. That is why Philip Lowe, Governor of the Reserve Bank, said, on 2 May, 'Inflation in Australia has passed its peak'. That's why all the ratings agencies, including Fitch Ratings, have said that it is not likely to contribute to inflationary pressures in the economy. That's why Westpac's Bill Evans said, 'I don't expect them to put upward pressure on interest rates.' <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr BOWEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMahon</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Climate Change and Energy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:56</span>):  I thank the honourable member for her question. Indeed, the Albanese government has spent the last 12 months restoring stability and certainty to energy policy in this country. We've done so because we know that over the last decade four gigawatts of dispatchable energy left our energy grid and only one gigawatt came on. That left Australian households, businesses and our entire energy system exposed to international pressures in a very suboptimal way, and we knew that we had to provide that certainty for investment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to report to the honourable member and the House that large-scale renewable investment is up 55 per cent over the last 12 months. I'm pleased to the report to the honourable member and the House that we have seen a record investment in 7.1 gigawatts of renewable energy across this country in the last 12 months, thanks to the policies of this government. That is a record which those opposite would not be able to boast. They wouldn't want to boast about it, because they didn't support renewable energy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know what has been necessary. It's been necessary to provide stability by enshrining our climate targets into the law of the land, and renewable energy investors from around the world have told us that that has been vital in encouraging investment into our country. We also know that it's been necessary to provide stability and certainty for investors, to tell them that the transmission will exist to support that investment. We have been rolling out our Rewiring the Nation policies across the country, opposed by those opposite. We know that we need to provide further stability, and we've done that in the budget. The capacity investment scheme which is reflected in the budget agreed unanimously with the states and territories. I have announced that the first auctions will occur in South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales. This is very important to provide that stability, and it will unleash up to $10 billion worth of investment and six gigawatts worth of investment. That's what these policies will do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that this is a massive job-creation opportunity for our country. That's why the arrangements announced by the Prime Minister and the President of the United States yesterday are so important, to ensure that our capacity as a renewable energy export powerhouse is harnessed in cooperation with our like-minded partners, none more important than the United States of America. This is what we've spent the last 12 months doing, and we know we have so much more to do. We are very pleased with progress in the first 12 months but we're far from satisfied—because we've got a decade of denial and delay to catch up on. We've got a decade of neglect. Twenty-two energy policies they gave us over 10 years and not one worked. We've been putting into place one energy policy, one climate policy, and it has been working. </span>

Prime Minister, in the central west of New South Wales communities like Eugowra, Molong, Cudal and Canowindra were devastated by the storms and floods of last year. The stories of heartbreak and tragedy have been made worse by the shocking and cold-hearted treatment of many local residents by some insurance companies. The anger in our communities is white hot, and I don't think we're alone. Will your government support a parliamentary inquiry into the response of insurance companies to recent natural disasters in Australia? </span>

I, indeed, have visited the member's electorate, with him, witnessing firsthand the devastating impact of the flooding that occurred, also witnessing, at the same time, the extraordinary resilience of communities that he represents—in common, it must be said, with the member for Riverina or the member for Page. Whenever you visit an area that has been devastated, you're struck by a couple of things. One is the extraordinary work of our professional support, including public servants but also the volunteers through organisations like the SES and the work that they do. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know as well that the issue of insurance has been a very big one for a long period of time. Getting communities back on their feet is vitally important, and insurance plays a big part on that. The government is spending $25.3 million over five years to help reduce the cost of insurance in disaster prone communities, and this includes the establishment of the Hazard Insurance Partnership with the insurance sector to address insurance issues driven by natural hazards. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The package will identify where the most pressing insurance issues are and how to best address them and support better targeted mitigation and resilience strategies. And, of course, we have a fund that we will spend every year on trying to get ahead of the impact of natural disasters, a fund that will ensure that issues including levies and other measures are implemented. We recently as well announced some $262 million over 10 years to upgrade flood gauges in high-priority catchment areas across Australia. There had already been some work done there in the member for Page's electorate, in the north coast of New South Wales, in partnership with the New South Wales government. There will be more work done in Queensland in areas that are affected. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I say this on behalf of the government but I think on behalf of every member here. We expect insurance companies to meet their obligations under the insurance code of practice, including the requirements to manage disputes in the payment of claims and to act in an open, fair, honest and transparent way with their customers. I'll speak with the relevant minister, the Assistant Treasurer as well, about your proposal for a parliamentary inquiry. I respect the way that you've put it forward as an appropriate way of raising that issue. I say that, with you, the government stands ready as with every member of this chamber to provide support for communities at their time of need. </span>

                  </a>  But we have had in the first 12 months a deliberate design feature of getting jobs moving. We have had getting jobs moving as a deliberate design feature of this government, getting wages moving as a deliberate design feature of this government and closing the gender pay gap as a deliberate design feature of this government. In the first 12 months, as the Treasurer has already said, more Australians are employed—330,000. It has been the best first 12 months of any Australian government. But that figure of 330,000 is not clouded by all those jobs being insecure. More than 280,000 of those jobs are full-time. There has been stronger employment growth than in any of the major advanced economies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not just jobs that have been growing as a deliberate design feature. Wages have been moving as well. Average full-time annual earnings are a thousand dollars a year higher, going into people's bank accounts, than they would have been if the growth levels of flatlining wages had remained as they were under the previous government. It is the fastest annual growth in guess how long—a decade. That's what happens when you stop having low wages as a design feature and when getting wages moving becomes a deliberate design feature of the government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But some of the best outcomes that we're seeing in both wages and employment are the statistics that have come out recently for women workers in Australia. We now have the highest number of women in recorded history in full-time work. The female unemployment rate, at 3.3 per cent, is the lowest it has been in 50 years. Why would it be that we're getting better female employment statistics coming through? Could it be connected to the fact that we now have a government that's implementing all 55 recommendations of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report? Could it be that gender equality is now an objective of the Fair Work Act? Could it be because we now have a government that turns up to the Fair Work Commission and argues for pay rises for people on low wages, including for feminised industries like aged care?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes that have been happening have been deliberate. When people had insecure work, when people were on sluggish wage growth, it was because of a deliberate decision from those opposite, and getting wages moving, closing the gender pay gap and getting people into secure jobs is a deliberate decision of the Albanese government. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Labor are slugging Queenslanders with a new tourism tax by increasing the passenger movement tax from $60 to $70. Why do Australians always pay more when Labor breaks its promises?</span>

The honourable member is right to say that the passenger movement charge is going from $60 to $70. It hasn't been indexed since I think 2017, so the change reflects the indexation of the charge.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What the honourable member didn't say in his question, but what the House might be interested in, is that this payment is for people leaving Australia. I have more faith in the tourism industry of Queensland than the honourable member does if he thinks an extra 10 bucks to leave Queensland is going to deter people from coming to Queensland in the first place. They're not sitting around in London or in Brussels thinking, 'I really want to hit the Sunshine Coast, but that 10 bucks on the way out is going to prevent me.' They're not sitting around in the capitals of Europe or North America or throughout our region saying, 'I really want to go to Cairns and drop a few thousand dollars in one of the most beautiful places on earth, but I won't do that because of the extra $10 that reflects the indexation from 2017.'</span>

I say that as a proud Queenslander and as a proud Australian. People will continue to come to Queensland because it's amazing, and people will continue to come to Australia because it's amazing. And 10 bucks to leave Australia again won't deter them. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We had lots of people there sharing their stories and were very keen to know what the government was doing to help them in the battle against scammers. Over the last few weeks, we've held a number of town hall meetings around the country, in the electorates of Tangney, Swan, Hasluck, Macquarie, Boothby, Isaacs, Moreton and Dunkley. At each of these forums, people have been telling the same story. They're being bombarded by emails and SMSs. They're having their money stolen, or threatened to be stolen, by criminal gangs who are preying on them and their innocence, and it's impacting their ability to engage in online commerce. They're that they want the government to do something about it. They know that the problem has got worse and worse and worse.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The simple fact of the matter is that the previous government on this issue was completely indolent. They left Australian households on their own to fight the scammers. Well, there's a new government, a new change and a fresh approach, and we are on the side of consumers. We're going to fight back against the scammers. We're establishing a national anti-scam centre, a world first, as a result of the announcement made in the budget last week—over $56 million. It will have three functions. The first is real-time reporting and sharing of information. So if a scam is reported anywhere in the country, it's shared with the people who need to act fast to pull up the barriers, put the red flags in, and stop the scammers from going to work. We're also going to put in place new fusion cells, which are action squads that will go after the scammers who are preying on Australians. Something the previous mob could have done, but they didn't!</span>

They should be as angry as they are now about the billions of dollars ripped out of Australians' bank accounts and flooded overseas on their watch. If only they were as angry about that as they are today. This initiative will work hand in hand with the work that my colleague the Minister for Communications is doing to put in place new registers for SMSs to ensure that those SMS messages are being filtered and blocked at source. It works hand in hand with the work that the Minister for Cyber Security is doing to ensure that we are uplifting our capacity as well. We will be putting in place new industry codes to ensure that we set out the responsibilities of the private sector and the rights of individual citizens. Australians won't be left alone under this government, unlike the previous mob. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Prime Minister, you would be aware that Stella Assange is in Parliament House and is, in fact, in the gallery right now. Prime Minister, why are you not meeting with Stella today? Will you meet with Stella tomorrow? And why won't you do more to see Julian Assange reunited with Stella and their young sons, Gabriel and Max?</span>

Indeed, who I meet with is determined by the priorities that my office has. A priority for us isn't doing something that is a demonstration; it's actually doing something that produces an outcome. And that's my focus—not grandstanding. If I thought that that would help, then, yes, the member for Clark would have a case. But I've made it very clear to the US administration and to the UK administration the Australian government's view. I appreciate the fact that that is now a bipartisan view after the comments last week of the Leader of the Opposition that enough is enough when it comes to the ongoing incarceration of Julia Assange and that nothing is served from the ongoing incarceration of Julian Assange.</span>

But what I have done is act diplomatically in order to maximise the opportunity that is there of breaking through on an issue which has gone on for far too long. I appreciate the member's sincerity on this issue, along with a range of other members from across the parliament who have raised this issue. As an Australian citizen, I have made representations. I will continue to do so. But this issue is not a simple one. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">My motivation here is not to make a judgement. People will have different judgements about the actions of Mr Assange and can still reach that conclusion of, 'Enough is enough.' But it is certainly my view that this issue does need to be resolved, and I'll continue to advocate, as I continue to advocate for Australian citizens around the world. That is the role that the Australian government has. That's the role we'll continue to have. I'm very pleased that this is now a bipartisan issue, and I acknowledge that.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, 12 months ago, Australians voted for a better future, and over our first 12 months in office our government has worked hard to deliver on our commitments to begin laying stronger foundations to support women across this country. In 12 months, we've embedded women's economic equality as a core economic imperative through prioritising gender equality as part of the September 2020 Jobs and Skills Summit. You heard from the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations the important role that that has played in getting employment for women but also getting wages growth for women. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've backed this up with investments of billions of dollars across our first two budgets. That includes targeted cost-of-living relief that supports women who are experiencing the most disadvantage, including by increasing the eligibility for single parent payments so parents can access it until their child is 14; investing in early childhood education and funding the biggest boost to paid parental leave since its establishment in 2011; and supporting a pay increase for aged-care and low-paid workers, who are overwhelmingly women, and funding this increase in the budget. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've led negotiations with the states and territories to finalise the National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children and backed that up with record investment of $2.2 billion in the budget. We have, of course, legislated paid family and domestic violence leave and funded and legislated all 55 recommendations of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report. We've passed legislation to publish the gender pay gaps of employers with 100 or more workers, a key reform to drive transparency and action towards closing the gender pay gap. And, importantly, we've introduced amendments to the Family Law Act to ensure that it is less traumatic for women and children impacted by domestic, family and sexual violence. We've done a lot in the first 12 months, but there is much more to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These policies, this legislation, do not happen by accident. Having women at the table, having women at the cabinet table and having women here in parliament actually matters when it comes to gender equality. I note that, while just 27 per cent of the previous government were women, more than half of the members of the Albanese government and just under half of the cabinet room are women. It actually matters when it comes to making policy. It's been a big 12 months when it comes to making sure we embed women's equality and gender equality in the policies of the Albanese government and taking action, but we know we've got more to do and we're up for the job.</span>

                  </a>  Since we came to office we immediately unlocked up to $575 million from the National Housing Infrastructure Facility, and indeed we already have homes being built across the country today because we unlocked that funding. In our first budget in October we announced the National Housing Accord, a commitment to build a further 20,000 affordable rentals with the states for key workers right across the country. With our expanded home guarantee, we've helped more than 50,000 Australians into homeownership since we came to office—50,000 in our first year. That includes 6,000 in regional Australia through the Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee that we brought forward by three months. Of course, in the budget we announced Commonwealth rent assistance would get a 15 per cent increase, the largest increase in more than 30 years; our build-to-rent changes; our depreciation changes that will add more than 150,000 new dwellings—</span>

                  </a>  Of course, in the budget we also announced a $67.5 million boost to homelessness after the terrible census figures about the increased number of Australians that were homeless. That was part of the additional $1.6 billion for our one-year extension of the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement with the states and territories. Of course, as I have said, the $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund, which is a critical part of our agenda, they continue to block in the Senate. They don't support it. The Greens senators don't support it. People come into this place and they want to talk about housing for Australians. They should be honest with their constituents that they are in the way of critical housing that Australians that need it most are relying on today. The sooner we get that fund through, the sooner we get the returns, the sooner we get more homes on the ground more quickly.</span>

Helios is a great electronics manufacturer doing some good work in defence and transport. It was also good, last week, to see a number of Australian manufacturers doing really well, be it Noumi foods in the member for Macarthur's electorate; Recharge Industries with the ambition to manufacture Australian-made batteries in Geelong, which the Deputy Prime Minister and the member for Corangamite are very happy to see; and also in Moreton, where Orrcon Steel is helping us manufacture products that will be important for the transition to a clean energy future. The common thread here being that Australian manufacturers with the confidence to do more onshore create great jobs for fellow Australians.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Twelve months ago, the Albanese government were elected on a commitment to build a future made in Australia. In that time, we've secured support for the $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund. In the last budget, just a few weeks ago, the Industry Growth Program was funded to help build small and medium businesses, provide them with the support to grow. We also had support for the Powering Australia Industry Growth Centre, plus the development of a National Battery Strategy, to manufacture more renewable technology here in Australia—all delivering for manufacturers today and tomorrow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, it would be a different story for manufacturing in Australia if the election had turned out differently. The coalition basically spent a decade daring manufacturers to leave, reducing support for manufacturing so that manufacturing self-sufficiency tanked. The coalition have gotten worse in opposition: pretending to care, never delivering. You cannot pretend to support manufacturing and then vote against the greatest investment in manufacturing capability in living memory in the National Reconstruction Fund. You can't pretend to be concerned about the impact of higher energy prices on manufacturers and then vote against the energy price relief that delivers them support. Those opposite are all addicted to pretending. They haven't learned a thing! They all got this from the member of Cook. Remember the member for Cook? He pretended to be a welder, he pretended a carpenter, he pretended to be a truck driver, he pretended to be half the cabinet! They cannot just continually pretend to care and also not be there. They can't be all talk, no walk. Australian manufacturers deserve better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, we've done a lot of work in the last 12 months, and we know we've got more to do. We will not slow down in our commitment to deliver a future made in Australia, and it's time those opposite actually did the same.</span>

KPMG urban economist Terry Rawnsley says there are 16,400 dwellings in Sydney approved, but not yet commenced—the highest number in four years. Yet the government's own budget papers say an extra 1.5 million people will come to Australia over five years. When will the minister finally admit that Labor has no plan to house its big Australia?</span>

Actually, one of the critical parts that I left out of my last answer was the fact we have on the national cabinet agenda renters' rights and how we're meeting regularly with the states and territories.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the former government, the housing ministers did not meet in almost five years. We've already had four meetings, where we are talking about how to get homes on the ground more quickly. A critical part of our National Housing Accord is actually about supply, it's about one million homes from 1 July 2024—our aspirational target that the states and local governments have signed up to. They are talking about what type of planning reforms the states and territories and local governments need to make to meet the one million homes.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of our comprehensive plan of the funding that we have already unlocked is the $575 million with homes on the ground already. There are also the National Housing Accord, which I've just talked about, where we are talking about planning reforms with the states and territories, and, of course, our Housing Australia Future Fund, which those opposite are voting against in the Senate. That's 30,000 additional social and afford affordable rental homes that those opposite are voting against. Then there's the 20,000 additional rental homes, affordable homes, that it would appear they don't support, being planned by us, the territories and the states under the National Housing Accord. We are getting on with the job of delivering more housing for Australians, but those opposite need to tell their senators in the Senate to get out of our way and to support the Housing Australia Future Fund. We're talking about returns of $500 million each and every year to be delivered in more housing right across the country. Those opposite need to understand that that fund is critical to institutional investment in getting more leverage and more investment in housing right across the country.</span>

Of course improving paid parental leave is a critical Labor reform. It's critical for families, for women and for the economy. We know that, when it's done right, paid parental leave can advance gender equality and grow the economy. Modelling from Impact Economics and Policy showed that the establishment of the Paid Parental Leave scheme in 2011 resulted in nearly 75,000 more mothers joining the workforce and of course $8.5 billion to our GDP. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is of course a proud Labor legacy from when we were last in government, and now this government is continuing to build on this legacy. In our first budget the Albanese government committed funding to improve paid parental leave. In our first year we legislated the first stage of our important reforms, meaning that from 1 July this year not only will more parents have access to the government payment but also they will have more flexibility in how they transition back to work and how they share care between them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since late March preclaiming has been open to families expecting a new child from 1 July. So far over 2,000 families have lodged a preclaim so that they can start to receive this entitlement as soon as their baby arrives. Of course, 180,000 Australian families will benefit each year from our more generous Paid Parental Leave scheme. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But of course when it comes to paid parental leave we're just getting started. Over the coming months the Albanese government will introduce further legislation that will implement the government's six months of paid parental leave. Of course, our significant boost actually makes up for nine years of wasted time by those opposite. Those opposite had nine years to improve paid parental leave and they wasted the opportunity. Quite to the contrary, they planned to cut paid parental leave and leave so many mums and dads without the support they need. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is only one side of this House that is delivering for Australian families, whether it's more affordable child care, better Medicare, cheaper medicines or, indeed, better paid parental leave. Actions speak louder than words. Those opposite tried to cut paid parental leave. We're getting on with the job of making it better for Australian families by expanding paid parental leave and making Australian families' lives better.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:35</span>):  I rise to speak on the Constitution Alteration (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice) 2023. I begin by acknowledging the traditional owners of the land on which we meet, the Ngunnawal and Ngambri peoples, and I acknowledge the traditional owners of the land which make up my electorate of Macnamara, the Bunurong people of the Kulin nation. I pay my respects to their elders past, present and emerging.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I greatly value the opportunity to speak on this unique and historic bill. It may well be one of the most important speeches we all get to make in this place, not because of whatever merits that we say but because of the intrinsic importance of the subject matter. There is no subject more important, no bigger issue confronting this parliament and our country, than the place of our First Australians in our national life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The history of Australia since 1788 has in many ways been an inspiring one. As the grandson of a refugee from Europe, I welcome the fact that Australia has given a new home to millions of immigrants, many of them refugees, and is still doing so today. But there has always been a dark aspect at the heart of Australian history. Our Australian nation was made possible only by the forcible dispossession of the people who were already living on this continent—the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Historian Henry Reynolds has recently estimated that up to 100,000 Indigenous people were killed during more than 150 years of violent dispossession. Only in recent decades have we come to acknowledge that shameful history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 1890s Australia's elected leaders came together to write a constitution for a new nation, a federated Australia. It never occurred to them to acknowledge the prior occupants of Australia. There were only two references to Aboriginal natives in the Constitution. One reference ensured they would not be counted for various purposes, and the other ensured that the power of making special laws for them was retained by the states. In 1967 the referendum removed both of these references but put nothing in their place. The bill before us today gives us a chance to put that right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although the Constitution is a practical working document, it is also the charter of our fabric of our nation. It is shameful that it contains no reference whatsoever to the people who lived on our wonderful lands for 60,000 years before the Europeans set foot. Today our First Nations people are asking us to repair that injustice, that glaring omission. I think it's important to stress how astonishingly simple, moderate and yet profound the request is that has been put to us by our First Nations friends. All they are seeking is recognition and consultation. It would be incredibly small of us to refuse such a request.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the reconciliation process, in the Uluru Statement from the Heart of 2017 our First Nations people have requested they be given a voice in our national parliament, in the form of a constitutionally enshrined voice to parliament. The Voice is a very simple request, as the bill before us sets out. It provides for a body called the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice. It provides that the Voice may make representations to the parliament and the executive government of the Commonwealth on matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The Voice, therefore, will not run programs. It will not allocate money. It will not be a bureaucracy, nor will it be a third chamber of parliament. It will not have legislative, executive or decision-making powers. It will be advisory. Again, I must point out how modest and simple but profound this proposal is. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What possible objections can there be? There seem to be two floating around. The first is that it gives Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people a unique or special status. We are asked: why is there no Italian or Indian voice to parliament? The answer to that is quite simple. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people do have a special place in our country's history. They have been here for over 60,000 years. They are the single oldest continuous culture with connection to land and to country, and they have been mistreated and dispossessed throughout our history. Recognising them is the first step towards healing the injustice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second objection is that we don't have enough detail about the Voice to Parliament, supposedly. This has been raised, in my opinion, as a diversionary tactic by people who will never be happy with any amount of detail. The framers of the Constitution very wisely did not seek to prescribe how parliament should exercise its powers. They set out very broad heads of power and left it to us, the parliamentarians, to decide how to put those powers into law. For example, in section 51, the marriage power simply states 'marriage'. There is no definition of marriage and no detail about what kind of marriage law parliament is to enact. That's why we had the freedom to legislate for marriage equality without the need of a referendum. The proposed constitutional amendment says clearly:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(iii) the Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws with respect to matters relating to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice, including its composition, functions, powers and procedures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the answer to the question, 'Where is the detail?' is that the detail will be enacted by this parliament after what will no doubt be a long debate in which every member and senator will get their say representing people from right across this country. That has always been the constitutional practice in Australia. It is one we are wise to follow in this case as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This referendum, like the 1967 referendum, marks a milestone in Australia's long journey towards coming to terms with our history and achieving genuine reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people in this continent. This act of recognition is long overdue, and that's why it will be liberating for us all to begin the healing and to begin the process of building a more inclusive future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me also say this. How Australians see themselves and how Australians see our country is a hard question to answer but an important question to answer. How do Australians see ourselves and the make-up of our country, this year when we are being asked to say yes to an Indigenous voice to parliament? I think it will say a lot about our country how we answer that question.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Do we wake up the day after the referendum having said no to the 250 delegates who came together in Uluru? What is that going to feel like? What is our country going to feel like if we say no? How will the young boys and girls who grow up in remote parts of our country, whose lives are fully ahead of them, feel knowing that Australia has said no to giving them the most basic levels of respect around recognition of their culture and their continuing connection to our land? How does it feel for a young Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person if Australia says no? I worry about that, but it also gives me hope to think about the opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It gives me hope to think about the fact that if Australia says yes, what is that going to take away from any of us? Nothing. Not a single right of any other Australian will be removed by this proposition—not one. It won't be diminished. It won't be touched. Yet, if Australia has the heart to say yes, think about the message that that sends about the recognition of our past and the sort of future that we want to build. What's it going to feel like in Australia if we say yes? And progress is never everything for everyone, but I know that the thought of saying no will set us back. But there's the hope and the promise and the possibility of saying yes, where each and every one of us, I hope, will do everything we can to help deliver this referendum for our country and for our future. I really hope that our country takes this step.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll finish by saying why it's so important to me. The idea of a voice is not a new one; it's one that has been around for decades. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have been asking for greater representation and for a say in the matters that are determined in this place and in others. Over 80 years ago, a man named William Cooper asked for a First Nations Voice through representation in parliament. At that stage, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people didn't even have the right to vote in this country. They were not counted as part of our population. And William Cooper knew that the best way for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to have a better shot at life was to have a say in those matters that decided their future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, this is not the same as William Cooper's request for a voice and for representation. It has evolved. This request still goes back to the single fundamental premise of respect—of saying that the best people who can help shape and guide a future for our country, and especially for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, are those communities themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why does that matter to me? Because William Cooper had not only the foresight to think about his people; he also thought about my people. In 1938, William Cooper led the only private march against the treatment of Jewish people in Nazi Germany. Two weeks earlier, a little girl, four years old, left that country as a stateless refugee on her way to Australia. She left with her parents. She was considered unequal in that society. She wasn't counted among the population. She was stateless. And William Cooper stood up for her. She was my grandmother. She came to this country and our country gave her everything, and it's given me everything as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think we still owe William Cooper. I still want to see this country honour his request, and I still think that the future that this Voice referendum can bring is one where it will not only make a practical difference to the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people—as it will. It will not only reflect who we are as a country and how we see ourselves but will also be a unifying moment where Australians will get a moment to stand inside a booth and think: do they say to no to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people or do they say yes? And to give something—to give that gift—will feel a whole lot better than to deny something. I say this to the Australian people: to give that gift will feel a whole lot better than to deny it. So I hope that this referendum and this bill get passed—that we say yes and we help build a better future together.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="300006" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHANEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:48</span>):  I rise today to support this bill, the Constitution Alteration (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice) 2023. I believe that it's time we asked the Australian people to make this change to our Constitution. This change will be both symbolic and practical. It will right a 122-year-old wrong. When it was written, our Constitution had two references to First Nations people and they were both negative. First Nations people were not to be included in the census, and no laws were to be made for their benefit. The 1967 referendum was a good first step, including Indigenous people in the census, and, in 1992, Mabo was a good second step, recognising their relationship with land. It's now time to be honest with ourselves about history, through constitutional recognition. It's time to commit to listening so we can develop policies that work and level the playing field for First Nations people over the next generation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recognising First Nations people through a voice will stimulate informed debate, set priorities and lead to practical outcomes. There's no doubt that this is a difficult policy area. We're particularly bad at developing policy to address the deep disadvantage faced by First Nations people. Mainstream government services have failed to improve outcomes for First Nations populations, and sometimes have even made them worse. That's why we need a different way. If we don't change how we approach the development of policy in this area, we'll be in the same situation in 20 years time, spending billions of dollars on programs that largely don't work. Constitutional recognition is a low-risk, high-return step towards a better way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The idea of listening to people affected by policy through a voice is consistent with the values in my community. My community is compassionate. They know that the life outcomes of First Nations people in Australia are often appalling and unacceptable and we need to do better. My community is interested in taking action now for long-term benefit. Intergenerational disadvantage is not solved overnight, but it remains urgent. This change is an example of the sort of long-term thinking we need to see more of in politics. If we act now we can create the conditions for better policy development, which will change lives over the next generation. My community appreciates an evidence based approach. They can see that listening and working in partnership is the only thing currently working in Indigenous policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This constitutional change is steeped in both sides of politics. John Howard first proposed constitutional recognition, and every Prime Minister since then has supported the idea. The wording of the constitutional change has been developed in partnership with constitutional conservatives. It's measured and reasonable. Every state government has committed to working in partnership under the Closing the Gap agreement, along with the federal government, because it's now commonly accepted that that is the only thing that works, and you can't work in partnership without listening. The Voice provides the structure needed to listen consistently and well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've come to this view based on my experience as well as on the views of my electorate. I was peripherally aware of the issues faced by First Nations people earlier in my life through my uncle and his 60 years of advocacy in this area. But I can track my own learning on this issue through various experiences over the last 20 years, as I have realised again and again that listening makes all the difference. Twenty years ago, as a consultant, I went on secondment to work for Indigenous organisations in Cape York. As a management consultant with a large firm, I thought I had the answers. Frameworks, problem-solving approaches—I was being paid by big companies to solve their problems. After four months with Noel and Gerhardt Pearson in Cape York I learned that it just doesn't work when you rock up with your assumptions and your solutions. Listening is a fundamental prerequisite for any meaningful change when it comes to complex issues. I was taught this lesson patiently and kindly by people who had seen so many like me before and who were still seeking better outcomes for their families and their communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Later, I was Aboriginal affairs manager at WesFarmers. When preparing our first reconciliation action plan I took what I thought was a pragmatic approach. As the largest private sector employer in the country, we needed to focus on opportunities, specifically jobs. This was where we could really make a difference. I thought the respect-and-relationships actions under the RAP framework were secondary. There were nice to have but not overly practical. I was advised differently by our Aboriginal steering committee, but it really took me about a year to fully realise how wrong I was. If you're followed around a retail store by the security guard you probably won't apply for a job there. I realised that without resetting our relationships based on respect we would never succeed with the jobs. You need to get the foundation right before you can build anything that will last. This can only be done by listening and learning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Later again, I saw the same problem from a service delivery perspective while working at Anglicare WA. We partnered with 30 Aboriginal community controlled organisations, and I saw that our services were far more effective when they were delivered in partnership, built on Indigenous knowledge and informed by the experience of those affected. From these experiences, I can see that we need to spend more time listening if we want anything to change and that embedding the Voice in the Constitution will move us in the right direction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to address some misconceptions and scare campaigns about the Voice. I think they fall into three categories: misconceptions about its origin, about its power and about its role in our broader system. Firstly, on the Voice's origin. This is not a Canberra voice. It's the next logical step in a long and thorough consultative process that culminated in the Uluru Statement from the Heart. I've heard questions about the legitimacy of this process. I sit on the Joint Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, which is currently doing an inquiry into the application of the UN Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous People in Australia. I've sat through many hours of public hearings and heard Senator Thorpe trying to get all sorts of experts to confirm that the Voice process was inconsistent with the UN declaration and that it didn't constitute free, prior and informed consent. No expert has said this. In fact, so far, they've all confirmed that the Uluru dialogue and the Voice will further the principles of the UN declaration. This is one of the reasons that more than 80 per cent of First Nations people support it. There are vocal opponents, and, as with any other group, we will never get 100 per cent support, but the media coverage of the vocal Indigenous minority doesn't appropriately reflect the great majority of Indigenous people who do support it. So I'm not compelled by any of the concerns about the origin of the Voice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, there are misconceptions about the power of the Voice. These are in both directions; either it will do too much or not enough. There's been some alarmism about the legislature grinding to a halt because every piece of legislation will be challenged on the grounds that it didn't listen to the Voice. There is no evidence to back this up. The Voice has an advisory role. It's appropriately up to the parliament to decide how to respond to advice. There's no obligation to accept the advice. The power is political, not legislative. This is like the alarmism we heard about land rights, that everybody was going to lose their backyards. It just won't happen. The former Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, Robert French, points out that parliament couldn't in fact make a law limiting its own law-making powers by legally requiring prior consultation. It's appropriate that parliament will retain the decision about how to respond to the advice. This is the job of parliament—to weigh up different interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Others say that the Voice will want to make representations on every issue. This is nonsensical. As representatives of First Nations communities, the Voice's mandate will be based on it focusing on the most important issues. There'll be plenty to keep it busy that's directly relevant to the lives of First Nations people. Members won't last long in their representative roles if they stray into irrelevant matters. The reality is that the Voice will not affect most people's lives. It will just reassure us that government is better advised and equipped to spend taxpayers' dollars when it comes to ensuring that First Nations people have a good chance in life. The flipside is concerns about it doing too little and being ineffective. The Voice is a start and a step in the right direction. It won't solve everything overnight, but it signifies a shift. It's worth remembering that the republic referendum failed, with many saying, 'The model isn't quite right; we'll wait for a better model.' Twenty-three years later, no better model has been seriously floated. We cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. And parliament retains the ability to continue to improve the model. I'm satisfied that we have the right balance on power. Not too much and not too little.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third type of misconception is about how it will fit into our existing system of government. Some have claimed it will be divisive, giving additional rights based on race, but the Voice is based on historical status as the first peoples here, not race. We have already acknowledged the existence of some collective rights through land rights 30 years ago, and the sky didn't fall in. This collective right is nothing more than being heard. Life outcomes are already divided, and this will bring us together, not drive us apart. Some have talked about the presence of First Nations MPs and senators in our parliament. These elected representatives have a duty to represent their communities. This is a very different role. There's a fundamental difference between representing a group of 100,000 people and an advisory role to government on a particular area of policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Putting the concept of the Voice into the Constitution will ensure that we don't give up when it gets hard. We have plenty of historical examples of Indigenous voices, but they have not had the legitimacy of recognition and a representative appointment process. It has been too easy to get rid of them if we don't like what they're saying. By putting the Voice into the Constitution, we're making a promise to keep listening and trying even when it gets hard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Others have wanted more detail, but detail doesn't belong in our Constitution. The Constitution is a place for ideas and principles—for example, only the concept of the High Court is covered in the Constitution. The mechanics of the court are set out under statute. The Constitution has one line about corporations, and the Corporations Act is more than 4,000 pages long. While a lot of work has been done on what the model might look like, it's appropriate that we only deal with the principal in the Constitution and that the model is developed building on the work done and in consultation with First Nations communities across the country. So I'm also comfortable with how the Voice will fit with the rest of our political, legislative and judicial system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to speak about the particular form of words being put to the referendum. I've thought open-mindedly about the wording and read the expert opinions. Three aspects of the wording are worthy of comment, on issues of sovereignty, the executive and the power of parliament. Firstly, the introduction to chapter IX says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Peoples of Australia:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is important symbolically and puts right the original oversight, but some have expressed concerns about its legal effect. I'm reassured that experts such as Robert French have clarified that this doesn't compromise the sovereignty of the Crown—or First Nations people, for that matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the proposed amendment provides that the Voice can make representations to the parliament and the executive government. Some have concerns about the inclusion of the executive being too broad. But the reality is that ministers develop policies, and public servants implement them. They are the executive. It's not just the passing of laws that requires input but the development and implementation of laws too. The Voice won't necessarily have an adversarial role with government, although it can hold government to account. The executive arm is likely to seek its advice to develop policy that actually works, and to work out how best implement it. This is completely in the interests of executive government and the country. Removing the executive would make the Voice significantly less effective, as well as being contrary to the request put by First Nations people to Australians in the Uluru statement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third aspect of the wording worthy of comment relates to the powers of parliament. The wording proposed doesn't limit parliament's powers to work out the mechanics of the Voice. Only the concept is protected, and everything else will be decided by the parliament, including its composition, functions, powers and procedures. This is appropriate. The Constitution is the place for principles, and the mechanics are governed by the parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I believe that Australians can look beyond the fear based language they're hearing and understand that the Voice is a simple, modest ask. The time has come for us to make a promise to listen. It won't fix everything, but it will give us a chance to learn, change and get better returns on our investments in better life outcomes for First Nations peoples. I commend this bill to the House. I look forward to the people of Australia having their say in the referendum later in the year and choosing a different future for our country and for our First Nations peoples.</span>

A call in the Uluru Statement from the Heart. A generous, warm invitation to Australians to support our Indigenous people; to join them on a journey to create a fairer, kinder, gentler and more inclusive country. An ask from a people who had their language oppressed; a people who were denied a count, denied a vote and denied their existence once this country was colonised. I am struck whenever I think about the notion of our referendum for a Voice. This referendum gives us as a country a moment to say yes, a moment to thank our First Australians for their 65,000-year custodianship of the land that we call home. It's an opportunity for us to right some wrongs, to progress our country. It is this generation's turn to step forward to progress the agenda, and it is our time to create a Voice to acknowledge a people with 65,000 years of continuous cultural connection to this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of my first political memories was as a very young teenager. I was going home from school where we'd talked about a referendum to count Indigenous Australians in the census. I remember going home quite stressed, marching into the kitchen with some aspect of dread because I planned to ask my mother how she voted in that referendum. You can't imagine the relief for this young girl who had decided that every Australian should have voted yes and dreaded that perhaps my parents hadn't. You can imagine the relief when my mother said: 'We voted yes. Your father and I voted yes.' I shouldn't have been surprised, but when we'd been discussing it at school no-one had mentioned that over 90 per cent of Australians across six states had voted yes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What a resounding moment that must have been for our country. What a wonderful moment for Australians to know that they were part of a journey to progress this country beyond the limitations of colonialism. And we now have this opportunity. We have this opportunity to move this, to progress this one step further. And we do so without fear. I will vote yes in this referendum without fear, because I know that, despite the misinformation program being run around the country, there is no fear in this for the Australian population. I know this is about continuing the journey.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should vote yes. We should do it for the Yorta Yorta peoples who, in 1881, asked the New South Wales government for land grants. We should do it for William Barak, the Wurundjeri elder who, in 1886, petitioned the Victorian government in opposition to the protection bill. We should do it for King Burraga and for Yorta Yorta man William Cooper who attempted to petition the king for representation in the federal parliament that the Commonwealth did not pass along.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First Nations people have been asking for 90 years for a say in their country, and this is our chance to join in a referendum and grant that request, delayed as it is. We should approach this referendum with the spirit in which we've been asked. For me, as a former school teacher, I'll be voting yes for every student I interacted with in my English classroom over decades, where we sat together and watched <span style="font-style:italic;">Frontier</span>, the ABC documentary miniseries about the forgotten wars in Australia. I'll be voting yes for every young person who sat in that classroom and was confronted with a history that they had no idea of before. We should do that because there are still Australians who have no idea about those frontier wars. There are still Australians who believe the myth of terra nullius. There are still Australians who believe that colonisation meant that our Indigenous population miraculously just moved to the centre of Australia and led a peaceful life there. These are the myths.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should vote yes for every Indigenous writer, for every Indigenous singer-songwriter, for a people who have forgiven us so much. And we should do it for every young person in this country, for their compassion, for their empathy. I think of the young people that I taught and, when these issues would come up, their outrage at our history, their outrage pre-dating the apology. We should do it because we've been on this journey for such a long time. We've been on this journey—for me it's been since that day when I asked my mother that question about that previous referendum. We watched Gough Whitlam with the sands with Lingiari. We listened to the Redfern address. We listened to the 'sorry'. We saw the reconciliation marches across the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Now we have an opportunity to embrace the future, to support the calls from our First Australians. We should do this for my friend Anita. We should vote yes for all of those who are part of the stolen generations. Anita is my friend, and she told me she had memories of riding her horse through town, followed by Aboriginal children who at the time she didn't know who were her cousins, because she was part of that generation. We should do it for her grandchildren—my nieces, Alix and Caitlin. We should do it to acknowledge in our Constitution that the First Australians existed then and still exist today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a great opportunity, and the referendum provides all Australians with the opportunity to have their say. The passage of this bill today is required to hold that referendum to amend the Australian Constitution to recognise the First Peoples of Australia in the Constitution by establishing an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voice. Once this bill is passed by an absolute majority of the House and an absolute majority of the Senate, a referendum will be held in the second half of this year. I know standing here the excitement in my local community about that referendum. In the City of Wyndham this year there will be 15,000 new citizens created, some thousands already done in the first half of this year, and when I meet with those families and when I meet those new Australians it's one of their questions. They're very excited about a referendum, they're very excited about being part of Australia's democracy and most say to me they will vote yes. For them, thinking about 65,000 years of continuous connection to this country is unfathomable. They are stunned when they hear about that continuous connection to this country, and they as new citizens want their opportunity to acknowledge that. They want to be part of a country that's on this journey. They want to be part of a country that can look back at its history since colonisation with honest eyes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be serious: this referendum acknowledges First Australians through a Voice to Parliament and will progress the other parts of the Uluru Statement from the Heart. Once we have a voice in that Constitution, truth and treaty will be what follows. This is an important moment for Australia, an incredibly important moment. I personally cannot express how privileged I feel to stand in this place to even discuss it, to be here while this parliament considers this referendum, this moment in history that is before us. It feels somehow like we've always been driven towards this, that we are compelled. The Australian people get to say if this journey continues, and a yes vote, when this comes, will create that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend this bill to this chamber because I commend the advancement of the ideas enshrined in this bill for this country. It will build a sense of unity that we haven't felt since the 1967 referendum. It gives us an opportunity as Australians to say that we are all-embracing, to say that we are an inclusive country, to acknowledge our past, 65,000 years worth of past, to acknowledge that First Australians belong in the Constitution and that a Voice to Parliament and a voice to government is what has been missing, despite 90 years of recorded history of First Australians asking for this. It's an incredibly important opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend this bill to the House, and I would ask all members here to support this bill to create the referendum and to take us on that united journey where, as a country, we can imagine ourselves going forward, completely united around the acknowledgement of the First Australians in our Constitution. They sound like dry words, but what they mean to me is that, in my decades on this planet and in this country, this is an incredibly important moment, and not just a historically important moment. This moment will be about the future. In this House, when we vote on this bill, we take the first step towards what that future might look like. Despite the things that were done to First Australians in the earliest years of the colonies, despite the deaths in the frontier wars, despite the suppression of language, and despite the stolen generations and governments allowing children to be taken from their families based purely on race, this is an opportunity for us to nod at the past and move forward as a united country where we acknowledge, and have the opportunity to acknowledge, First Australians in our Constitution. It's a small ask but a huge agenda that that would bring forward, where we could move together as a country, healed, and that's the most important part.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Uluru Statement from the Heart, as the Prime Minister says so often, is a generous invitation to walk on a journey with First Australians. Voting on this legislation in this parliament is the first step. Then a referendum and a vote at that referendum is the second step, and what a unifying day it potentially could be. I know that, in my part of the world, the families that I represent and those I speak to are really looking forward to the opportunity that this referendum provides, they're really looking forward to the notion of uniting Australia around this idea and they're really looking forward to having a Constitution that actually acknowledges our history, most importantly. I commend this bill to the House. I look forward to the vote. I look forward to the referendum.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LITTLEPROUD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Nationals</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:17</span>):  The legislation before the House, the Constitution Alteration (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice) 2023, proposes a new section in the Australian Constitution that the Nationals fundamentally disagree with. We support the right of all 26 million Australians to have their say, to have their vote in this referendum, but it should be the right question. It will be the people of Australia who decide the outcome of this referendum. That is why we supported the passage of the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Amendment Bill 2022 through this parliament. The bill before the House is about changing the Constitution, our nation's founding document.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nationals have major concerns about the committee process we just witnessed when it comes to examining the proposed bill. As my Nationals colleague Pat Conaghan, the member for Cowper, a member of the Joint Select Committee on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice Referendum, outlined in his dissenting report:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The time afforded for consideration of the provisions of the Bill has been inadequate and does not acknowledge the magnitude of changing our constitution. The Committee has held a total of five public hearings over 15 consecutive days, in which an unreasonably tight deadline was dictated to explore the evidence and provide a report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was disappointing and a thoroughly flawed process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, the Voice will not help practically improve the welfare of Indigenous communities, especially women and children, in regional, rural and remote Australia. It will create another taxpayer funded level of bureaucracy in Canberra. Our nation needs a better bureaucracy, not a bigger one. Prominent legal experts hold serious concerns over this legal risks of this change to our nation's birth certificate and the prospect of normal government decisions being caught up in the courts for years. There's still no detail on how the Voice would operate and the powers it would potentially wield. It will also divide Australians by conferring extra political rights on a separate and special class of people in our Constitution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nationals consulted in genuine and sincere faith with our electorates, constituents, members and grassroots organisations, as well as representatives of the 'yes' and 'no' campaigns, about the proposed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice to Parliament. The Nationals also went through a comprehensive internal process which was led and guided by Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, an incredible, passionate and strong Indigenous leader with lived experience in the issues impacting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. As the party dedicated entirely to regional, rural and remote Australia, the Nationals have examined this through a unique lens. We bring a different perspective with lived experiences when it comes to addressing the challenges and the impacts of Indigenous Australians. It's an essential point to make. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nationals believe that adding another layer of bureaucracy in Canberra will not genuinely close the gap for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. Australia has had an Indigenous representative bureaucracy before. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission was notorious for its inefficiency, dysfunction and wastefulness. To this day, across rural, regional and remote Australia, we still live with and are dealing with the consequences of this failed approach. More bureaucracy in Canberra is not the solution for tackling systemic and entrenched disadvantage. Simply put, we don't need bigger bureaucracy, we need a better bureaucracy. The reality is that vulnerable communities have real issues which require practical and frontline evidence-based responses which empower local elders and leaders, rather than adding more red tape for the way government operates in our nation's capital. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, the Nationals want to address the serious issues, impacting Indigenous Australians by delivering frontline evidence-based and place-based solutions which will help lift Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people out of poverty by stimulating economic participation, improving access to education, enhancing the provision of health services and eliminating domestic and family violence. We believe that bureaucracy should leave Canberra and visit communities and meet with local elders and leaders around regional, rural and remote town halls and camp fires instead of bureaucracy coming to Canberra. Each community has vastly different needs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Around Australia there are some positive models and initiatives which have made a real difference. The Indigenous Procurement Policy, the IPP, is one of them. The IPP stimulates Indigenous entrepreneurship and business development, providing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples with more opportunities to participate in the economy. Since 2015, the Indigenous procurement program has made a tremendous difference, generating over $5.3 billion in contracting opportunities for Indigenous businesses. By the time the coalition left office, this involved over 35,700 contracts awarded to more than 2,100 Indigenous businesses. This procurement program has been a genuine game changer for creating Indigenous jobs and generating economic growth. But there were other success stories.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cashless debit card was specifically designed and aimed at protecting vulnerable women and children in disadvantaged communities by preventing welfare payments being used for cash to purchase alcohol and drugs and engage in gambling. Before Labor scrapped it, evaluations of the cashless debit card showed that this program was working. Now that it has been removed from some of our most at risk communities, the reports of the chaos, dysfunction and violence which this decision has unleashed have been heartbreaking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we were in government, the federal coalition also invested $1 billion into Closing the Gap measures, including early childhood, health, education and support for families. Although huge challenges remain, there has been some progress on some important targets, such as improving access for early childhood education, children being born with a healthy birth weight and reductions in the rates of youth detention. This should give us some hope moving forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed Voice to Parliament conflates two entirely separate issues. Support for recognising Indigenous people in the Australian Constitution, a move that I'm confident would have the overwhelming support of the Australian people, is a totally different matter to supporting a constitutionally enshrined Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice to Parliament. Combining the two is not conducive to securing real, genuine, sincere and long-term reconciliation, which should be about fostering unity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Referenda are supposed to be about detail. The Constitution gets interpreted by the High Court, so the Nationals believe it's essential that we take a sensible, considered, serious and orthodox approach to what is being proposed by examining the available information. On this front, the central questions and concerns remain unanswered. Given the deliberate lack of detail, establishing the Voice risks embroiling the High Court of Australia in inflamed political debate. This has enormous risk to the way that our democratic system functions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here in Australia, our core democratic values are worth fighting for. They're worth preserving and protecting. The Nationals believe that the Voice undermines our robust, genuine liberal democratic values, values which we will always support and which have helped make our country the best in the world. Crucially, a core component that underpins our free, liberal, democratic society in Australia is the fundamental principle that every citizen is considered equal under the law. A constitutionally enshrined advisory body to parliament based solely on a person's race does not align with this. This is about making sure we come back to one principle, one tenet: we're all equal. There are 227 voices here in the Australian parliament representing all 26 million Australians, no matter their colour, no matter their creed, no matter their religion. We take that seriously. I'm proud of the fact that this nation has elected 11 Indigenous Australians not just to represent Indigenous Australians but to represent all Australians. It's for these reasons the Nationals will, therefore, be opposing this bill.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We, gathered at the 2017 National Constitutional Convention, coming from all points of the southern sky, make this statement from the heart.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to address a few points made in the Uluru Statement from the Heart, which, as the Prime Minister rightly says, is an invitation to all Australians to walk forward together. It is an auspicious time for the Uluru statement and the Voice to Parliament, for now we see a crystallisation of many months and years of effort—not a flawed effort, as the member for Maranoa suggested just now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was deeply concerning to hear a number of the points the member for Maranoa spoke to. I hope that, on reflection, hearing the speeches that those on this side and those on the crossbench and those within his own community make may well enable his entire National Party to reflect as well, and, at the time and the day of voting, to think of voting yes. There are moments of truth in every parliamentary process, and they are generally twofold. The first is when the bill is laid before the parliament for the first time, and the second is when it is passed by the parliament. For a referendum bill, there are three.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Growing up in the small country town of York, I used to work at the local courthouse as a volunteer. I was deeply alarmed and shocked taking in tourists and looking at the holding cell only for Indigenous Australians, where the ball and chain was still present on the floor. In this courthouse there were a number of different, rather horrific stories, but none I could forget more so than those that were experienced by Indigenous Australians in that cell. It was just a small cell, the equivalent of four seats in this chamber, with a sand floor where, we know, from the history records, they endeavoured to escape by scraping away at the sand. The reasons they were taken to those cells were so appalling and shocking, and so simple in essence: they were just trying to be able to stay on their land and feed their family. Up until quite late, around the 1970s, Indigenous Australians still had to hold a pass to be able to come into the town centre of York. This is not ancient history; this is recent history which we know so little about. We have such little understanding of exactly what our First Australians have had to endure since colonisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The people that convened to progress the Uluru statement asked for, first, a voice to parliament; second, a truth-telling to understand those stories and understand the impact on the intergenerational trauma that has endured since; and, thirdly, the makarrata. I believe we are in an amazing, privileged position, as this parliament of 2023, to progress the very first step in full reconciliation by enabling a voice to parliament. As one of the larger urban communities of Indigenous peoples, I have heard different questions raised within my community. One of them was about ensuring that sovereignty is upheld. The Uluru statement addresses sovereignty: that there have been sovereign nations here for tens of thousands of years, that the sovereignty is spiritual and finds its incarnation in ancestral ties to the land and that the sovereignty has not been ceded and co-exists with that of the Australian government. So, whilst many people have been concerned about sovereignty in this debate, it stands there within the statement upon which the referendum for a voice to parliament finds its firm foundation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The statement goes on to say that the ancient sovereignty can shine through as a full expression of Australia's nationhood. And here is the gift that is offered from Uluru to Australia, from the heart of the nation to the nation at large. Here are the first peoples recognising that for Australia to move forward together, reconciling the tragedy and dispossession, the racism, the hurt and the violence, the stolen, the unseen, and the unheard, the whole country must be offered the gift that only the first peoples can offer—the gift of themselves. Gifts require a giver and a receiver to be perfected, and this is the gift of culture. The Prime Minister has spoken of a hand outstretched from Uluru. The statement says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">When we have power over our destiny our children will flourish. They will walk in two worlds and their culture will be a gift to their country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has created in its first peoples intergenerational dispossession, intergenerational poverty, intergenerational dislocation and intergenerational trauma. Over two centuries and more, we have failed to value the gift of culture that is now being offered. The opportunity that I have had throughout my life of being able to travel to different countries around the world and experience different cultures firsthand and see how much they're valued and loved helps me to really see the contrast of where we are as our own nation and how we regard our own First Nations culture. I treasure and value that culture. I look forward to seeing it elevated and continuing to grow and be understood across schools in our nation and for multicultural groups to participate and witness Indigenous culture. It is truly a gift. But there are still people who think that the Voice will be a gift from Australia to Indigenous people.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The referendum may even pass simply on the number of goodhearted Australians who believe that when they vote yes, they will be doing someone else a favour, and it won't cost them anything.  In truth, when we vote yes and support this change to the Constitution, we will all be doing ourselves a favour and will be changing the very nature of our nation. We will at last be receiving the gift and embracing the gift of culture into the very heart of our government—from that is where the Constitution lies. It is not possible to hear the statement, 'This is the torment of our powerlessness', and believe it without then also realising that the remedy to powerlessness is always power.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once the referendum has passed, then there shall be a body to be called the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice. Once the referendum has passed, then the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice may make representations to the parliament and the executive government of the Commonwealth on matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. This is the way we create power in our system of government, with laws, and when laws are not enough, we go further. From the heart of the country, we respond to the challenge to bring real and lasting change to the very heart of our power, the Constitution. The Uluru statement closes with:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I visit schools and have the opportunity to present three Australian flags, our Australian flag, our Torres Strait Islander flag and our Aboriginal flag, the children are proud of all three in equal measure. They are proud to speak to what the colours mean. They are proud to speak to what the symbols mean. They are proud to speak to what the lines mean. Where I live, they embrace the opportunity to sing the national anthem in Noongar language. I trouble and I worry about what the curriculum will say on the Monday following the referendum. What will the teachers say to the children if it is anything other but a resounding yes?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I call upon those opposite to reflect on the statement you are actually making about yourselves and about your party. This is an opportunity to rise above the politics and think about what we can say as a nation. I accept the invitation. I will walk on that path to the future of this country. I ask and implore that you reach deep into your hearts, speak to our First Nations people and ask yourself, 'Will not a Voice to Parliament mean that they are able to have an opportunity to speak directly to the parliament, to the executive, to the government, about laws that relate to them; to ensure that they have an opportunity to say what the impact would be, what the change will be; and an opportunity to be able to fully direct their own future?' I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although I am standing here today in the privileged position of an elected representative, my goal today, as it has always been when speaking on matters that directly impact my local community, is to endeavour to reflect the views of those I represent. Today I have sought to elevate the voices of First Nations people, including in my home state of Tasmania, in this speech, because, as others have already pointed out today, the Voice is not about me or other politicians in this place; this is about all Australians. As my friend the member for Menzies pointed out, reasonable people can disagree, and the law is, by definition, contested. As elected members, those are considerations we have to weigh up.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this instance, I return to what our First Nations people have asked us to do as a guiding principle which is reflected in the Uluru Statement from the Heart. As shared in the 2017 statement:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">With substantive constitutional change and structural reform, we believe this ancient sovereignty can shine through as a fuller expression of Australia's nationhood.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Proportionally, we are the most incarcerated people on the planet. We are not an innately criminal people. Our children are aliened from their families at unprecedented rates. This cannot be because we have no love for them. And our youth languish in detention in obscene numbers. They should be our hope for the future.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The impact on Indigenous communities from white settlement in Australia continues to this day, and Tasmania is sadly no different. The first documented contact between Indigenous Tasmanians and Europeans occurred in 1772. In 1803, the first permanent European settlement in Tasmania was established at Risdon Cove. In the years that followed, as the British population grew in the state, so the number of first inhabitants began to fall, their destruction hastened by violence, dispossession and disease. By 1818, there are fewer than 2,000 left on our island. Just a few years later, rising tensions gave way to the Black War. I would highly recommend Nicholas Clements's book to anyone wishing to gain a greater understanding of this war and its significance in the history of our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A recent trip to Wybalenna on Flinders Island with Minister Linda Burney was an emotional reminder of the cruelty inflicted. This remote location, on a remote island far from their own island home, was used as an Aboriginal settlement for more than 130 Aboriginal people from 1834 to 1847, with just 47 surviving before eventually being transferred to Oyster Cove, south of Hobart. Abductions of women and children were rife from the very beginning, paving the pathway towards forcibly removing children from their own loving homes, perpetrating unspeakable pain that we can't begin to imagine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Time and time again, we can look to the pages in our history to see how government policies, through deliberate action or inaction, have led to consistently poor outcomes for the world's oldest culture. We know we cannot change the past, but, this year, we have an opportunity to turn the page and to take the first meaningful steps towards true reconciliation in this country.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For Nick Cameron, Chair of the melythina tiakana warrana Aboriginal Corporation and director of the Tasmanian Aboriginal Legal Service, son of renowned elder Aunty Patsy Cameron, it's a chance to move beyond what has already been done and create a stronger, brighter and more equitable outcome. I would like to read his commentary to me in full, as it bears listening to. He says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Intergenerational trauma and disadvantage remain high within Tasmania for Tasmanian Aboriginal people. The impacts of invasion, dispossession, genocide, segregation, family separation and institutional and community racism has had and continues to have significant impacts to the health and wellbeing of Tasmanian Aboriginal people. The voice will allow Tasmanian Aboriginal people to bring advice to the national government and Parliament on what needs to happen to improve the services and support programs specifically needed for Tasmania. This is critical for improving the lives of Tasmanian Aboriginal people, whilst we share many of the same problems as other jurisdictions many are also unique due to our history and culture. A voice for Tasmania is critical to bring the issues directly impacting on us as Tasmanian Aboriginal people to the national stage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Incarceration rates especially for our young people remain significantly higher than the general population. Life expectancy, suicide, health in general and mental health are below national levels. Social disadvantage with intergenerational family poverty, financial stress, poor educational outcomes, family violence are all at unacceptable levels without signs of improving. Again, the issues and solutions to these problems are unique to Tasmania and only the Tasmanian Aboriginal communities through our own voice can genuinely improve these systemic problems. Our communities have many of the solutions to our problems, we just need to be provided the opportunity and respect to be heard. The answers to the problems for the Northern Territory or Western Australia may not be the right answers to the problems we face in Tasmania, the voice will provide carriage for our issues and solutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Tasmanian Aboriginal Community has its own unique challenges with political and funding imbalance and recognition of identity impacting on the Closing the Gap targets. The voices of Aboriginal communities and individuals is silenced due to the power imbalance and until the voices of the wider community are heard the lives of Tasmanian Aboriginal people will not improve. Funding in who receives it and who it is made available to continues to be a big issue within Tasmania directly impacting on the access to services that are needed to support the wider communities. Funding needs for Tasmania are specific for Tasmania and its regional communities, we need a voice to represent everyone so a level of equality and equity can be assured. This is something TRACA has been calling on for many years without success.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Tasmania has a very high level of lateral violence that prevents communities and individuals from speaking up, we need support to stop this intercommunity abuse, so all people are free to speak without fear of reprisals or social media violence. The Voice will provide opportunities for individuals to stand up and become new leaders within our communities which can only be a good thing. Government at a State and National level has a responsibility to help communities navigate lateral violence which is a tool to silence and disempower the ones without the capacity to defend themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Tasmania is 6 years behind the other States in a state process for treaty and truth-telling, this is a tragedy and directly impacting on the lives of Tasmanian Aboriginal people. We need the national voice to help the state transition to a treaty and truth-telling process as quickly as possible to prevent the disadvantage of our communities compared to mainland mobs. Land returns and self-determination through treaty is critical for Tasmania to move forward, the voice will be needed at a state and national level to push forward these important agendas. The voice at both levels will be critical to ensure the entire community are empowered to be involved and have a say in this process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Something needs to change; we cannot continue to do the things we have always done. The communities want more than symbolic recognition, they call for positive solutions that will improve the lives of our people. We are yelling loud and clear it's no longer acceptable for our challenges to be used as a political game for personal self-interest. The Tasmanian Aboriginal community expect and deserve leadership, the voice will give us an enshrined and protected platform through the referendums national mandate to be heard loud and clear and not ignored or further silenced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are tangible and intangible nuances within all communities and Tasmania is no different. It is implausible for decisions made by Canberra on policies and support programs to be made without direct advice from the people who live within the communities it is targeted towards and impacts on. This is the core purpose of the voice for Tasmanian Aboriginal people, to give those in power and policy-making positions the critical community-level advice they need for appropriate and considered decision-making, nothing less and nothing more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For John Clark, Chairperson of the Flinders Island Aboriginal Association, the Voice is an opportunity to be heard and create practical change on the ground in his community. He says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The hope if successful would give the organisation a vehicle to raise our thoughts and concerns about legislation, policy and how proposed policy on how it would impact the day to day lives of the aboriginal community we deliver services to and advocate on behalf of. It means the decision makers hopefully take into account all the concerns and input from all the communities across Australia, not just peak bodies or others with vested interests. I think it has the potential for decision makers to be more informed in order to make better decisions as most of the time, it is not one size fits all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do think it's critical to address some of the concerns about the question in the referendum. No, the Voice will not have veto power nor act as a third chamber. It will simply and reasonably give advice on laws made specifically for and about Indigenous Australia. To claim otherwise is a deliberate and harmful misrepresentation of the facts, and I'm disappointed to have seen this wilfully perpetuated by some.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nor does the argument that this referendum is dividing the country by race make sense. When the Constitution was drafted in 1901 it specifically excluded Indigenous Australians. While the exclusion was removed at the 1967 referendum, the races power still exists, providing parliament with the power to make laws specifically about any group on the basis of race, and this power has only been used to make laws about our First Nations people. So, if these laws exist, it's reasonable in my mind that Indigenous people have their voices heard over those laws. I'm also certain that the reintroduction of the cashless welfare card is not in keeping with that sentiment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've also heard the argument that the Voice is, at best, tokenistic. To me there is nothing more tokenistic than supporting the recognition of our First Nations people and falling short of providing a permanent platform to ensure their voices are heard now and for generations to come. If you support constitutional recognition but you oppose the Voice, what exactly do you hope to achieve? You can't have the symbolic without the practical. They are intrinsically linked.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This referendum provides an incredible chance to begin righting so many wrongs and to bring about tangible differences in quality-of-life outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I think that most Australians agree that the status quo isn't acceptable and that as a country we must do better. Here is our chance. This is what First Nations people have asked for.</span>

If this opportunity is lost, how long will it be before the chance comes around again? As one lady from the Flinders Island Indigenous community said to me during my visit to the area with Minister Burney a few months ago, just how long do we have to wait?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:50</span>):  I begin by acknowledging the traditional owners and thank them for their strong and continuing stewardship, particularly the Yuggera people of my electorate of Moreton. I'd also like to acknowledge, sadly, the death of a senior Indigenous person in my life, Yvonne Long, the mother of my good friend Wayne Long. She passed away on Friday. Vale, Yvonne. Later this year, Australians will have an opportunity to change our Constitution via a referendum, and I would have loved for Yvonne to be involved in that referendum. For those under 42, this is your first chance to vote in a referendum. My oldest son turned 18 earlier this year, and so he will have an amazing opportunity to change the country that he lives in on the very first occasion he goes to the ballot box.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill we're debating, the Constitution Alteration (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice) 2023, is the next step, a chance for the Australian people regarding two simple things, recognition and consultation: firstly, recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who have been here for over 65,000 years as being this nation's First Peoples—recognising our First Peoples—and, secondly, consultation. It's about listening to First Nations people on the practical changes that will have an impact on them, their families and their communities—consulting our First Peoples. It is about recognition and consultation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These concepts didn't come from Prime Minister Albanese or Prime Minister Morrison—definitely not Prime Minister Abbott, despite him moving Aboriginal affairs into the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, or even prime ministers Gillard or Rudd, despite the latter delivering that historic apology to the stolen generations on my first day in this chamber. Sadly, the opposition leader chose not to hear that apology. He missed that apology, just as he's missing the mark when he deliberately misrepresents recognition and consultation as concepts springing from Canberra. Imagine spending 100 nights a year in Canberra every year for more than two decades but still having the hide to use 'Canberra' as a pejorative term. Badmouthing the place where you deliberately chose to spend more than 2,000 nights sounds a little bit counterintuitive or hypocritical.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that First Nations recognition and consultation aren't new ideas either. They've been talked about for decades. These ideas were started by First Nations people and culminated in their Uluru Statement from the Heart. This document is a powerful and emotive statement that a modern, progressive, reconciled Australia simply cannot ignore. To quote Thomas Mayo:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Uluru Statement from the Heart is a sacred First Nations' invitation to the Australian people. It was conceived on 26 May 2017 from the collective experiences of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples during an unprecedented process of dialogue and consensus building. Forged from more than two centuries of hardship and struggle, the Uluru Statement gives hope to a nation born from many nations, that we may find our collective heart.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remind the chamber that the first step outlined in the Uluru statement was to have an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice enshrined in our Constitution—a Voice that will enable local representatives to make representations to the Australian parliament and executive on matters that relate to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It will amplify the voices of First Nations peoples from communities and regions on matters that affect them, sending grassroots into the halls of Canberra. That's a metaphor; there wouldn't be actual grass, obviously.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I return to the legislation before us. When this place listens to the Voice regarding making and changing relevant laws and policies, we know that it will improve the lives of First Nations peoples. It will deliver better bang for the buck re spending taxpayers' hard-earned dollars. It will help us close the gap, as Prime Minister Kevin Rudd committed to 15 years ago and as every prime minister thereafter has committed to. Governments at all levels achieve better outcomes when they work in genuine partnership with First Nations communities. The constitutional amendment ensures that the Voice will be an enduring, independent representative body that cannot be taken away by the whim of politicians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is the product of robust and detailed consideration by the Referendum Working Group and the Constitutional Expert Group, and via consultation with state and territory governments. It empowers this parliament to legislate about the day-to-day operation and functioning of the Voice, allowing it to evolve over time. This is how this document works, our Constitution. The heads of power are contained in the document that was signed off by Queen Victoria back in August 1900. On the level above us, on level 1, the public can look at the British act of parliament signed by Queen Victoria's own hand during her 64th year on the throne. This document, our Constitution, has only been altered eight times in 122 years, despite 44 different questions having been put to the Australian people. The design principles for the Voice, which the referendum working group developed and agreed on, will inform the government's design of legislation to establish the Voice.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a lot of bunkum floating about at the moment, especially on social media, but also down at your local bar or local coffee shop, and maybe even coming from the other side of the kitchen table. So let me be clear about the design principles:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The Voice will be chosen by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people based on the wishes of local communities</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Members of the Voice would be Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander, according to the standard three-part test, coming from each of the states, the territories and the Torres Strait Islands, but would have specific remote representatives and balanced gender representation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That means that members of the Voice would be expected to connect with and reflect the wishes of their communities—a true grassroots organisation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Voice is not a threat to this place. It's an invitation for our place of work to be better, more effective and even—dare I say it—a little more noble. A parliament and executive that is better at making laws and establishing and running programs to close the gaps in education, health, housing, justice—the list goes on. This invitation from our First Nations people is not to be feared but is to be accepted and embraced. This bill contains the constitutional amendment for parliament's consideration prior to it being put to a referendum.</span>

Queen Victoria's signature was only the royal assent, and then it was proclaimed on 17 September 1900. But, as we all know, technically our country didn't kick off until Tuesday 1 January 1901. The United States started on 4 July 1776. That was a Thursday. Canada started on 1 July 1867, a Monday—but I digress.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No. 3 is Warren Mundine, prominent 'no' campaigner and political chameleon untroubled by loyalty, perhaps. In the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span> in April Mr Mundine wrote that the referendum, if successful, would reverse the 1967 referendum. This notion comes straight from the cookers and QAnon crowd. It's complete rubbish.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No. 2, we sadly go to Queensland with Senator Hanson, who, for those that can remember, was kicked out of the Liberal Party over comments about First Nations peoples all the way back in 1996, so it isn't a surprise she is on the 'no' campaign. Such positioning is part of her political business model. Senator Hanson was first out of the blocks in September last year, claiming the Voice was a form of apartheid. This term has become the calling sign for many and goes back to what Nikka Savva said about all racists voting no. This reference is utterly without foundation and shows great disrespect to the people of South Africa, like the late Nelson Mandela, who fought against real apartheid in that country. Anyone who thinks this is the same almost certainly belongs in that racist column.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I get my number one pick, some more dishonourable mentions: the Hon. Senator Michaelia Cash, for thinking that the Voice would give advice on parking tickets; Tony Abbott, saying it would do nothing, coming from the man who cut and slashed funds from First Nations programs and communities; Peta Credlin, who worked for the Abbott government, who just last week likened the debate to what happens in North Korea—again, like the apartheid comments, go talk to North Koreans and see what they think—and the lower house MP who held a community forum with two white men speaking for two hours about the Voice and then, when a First Nations person wanted to speak, said, 'Sorry, we don't have enough time.'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My number one pick is the member for Farrer, the Deputy Leader of the Liberals. The member for Farrer, just like that angry old white man, Mike O'Connor, forgot that Australia has a long history of First Nations men and women fighting for Australia in overseas conflicts—Mike O'Connor was another mention from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Mail</span>—with many losing their lives on the shores of foreign countries, never to come back to their homes where their people had walked for 65,000 years or more. Why I mention this again is the member for Farrer said that the Voice would have a de facto veto over Anzac Day—yes, that's correct; that's what she said. Even the honourable member for New England, to his credit, said this was utter nonsense, and if the $100 lamb roast bloke thinks you're dribbling nonsense, you deserve the Voice bunkum gold medal.</span>

Ken Wyatt, Nathan Appo, Professor Anne Twomey, the Hon. Linda Burney, Senators Pat Dodson and Malarndirri McCarthy, former chief justice Kenneth Hayne and Bret Walker, to name but a few. Locally, I've spoken to elders, including Aunty Deb Sandy and Uncle Bob Anderson, and my other colleagues in this place: Jana Stewart, Marion Scrymgour and Dr Gordon Reid.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make sure, when I wake up on the Sunday after that referendum, I'll have done my bit and voted yes. I want my son's first vote to have made a difference—the same one vote every eligible Australian will be able to make, whether you're the Prime Minister or a year 12 student who has just turned 18. Your vote will be the same. When you vote yes, not only will have you made a huge step in helping First Nations people and their communities towards a better life; you'll also be saving and changing lives. You will have made a positive change for our nation. This document, our Constitution, is a complicated document. It's taken a long time to get here. Let's make sure that the next time we take it to the Australian people to change this document, the document signed by Queen Victoria back in 1900, that it reflects a modern, inclusive Australia. Vote yes. I recommend the legislation to the chamber.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WALLACE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:05</span>):  At the outset, what I'd like to say is the question of whether to support the Voice or not in the upcoming referendum is an issue on which reasonable minds will differ, so I was very disappointed at the exposition that the member for Moreton has just given—a series of character assassinations of people who had a different view to him. If that's not divisive, I don't know what is. I respect the fact that the member for Moreton might have a different view to me, but I'm not going to assassinate his character or anybody else on the other side. So I would just remind those opposite that you are not going to unite Australians by pulling those who have a different view to you under. That is not the way we operate in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What Australians are being asked to vote on at a referendum later this year is very serious. It's a question which goes to the character of our country, the function of our government and the future of Australia in what I think most of us in this place would agree is an unstable world. The Australian Constitution—I agree with the member for Moreton's view on this point—is our most important legal document. It is a fluid document. It is a document that was drafted over a decade or so more than 120 years ago by our constitutional forefathers. It hasn't been changed by a referendum since 1977, nearly 50 years ago. How old does that make you feel, Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas? In one fell swoop, we could potentially see 122 years of continuous democratic tradition permanently altered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I visited three schools last week, not so much to talk on the Voice, but just to talk about civics. It's something I often do. I love talking to schools. I always remind students at schools that Australia is one of the longest-serving continuous forms of democracy in the world. Most people prick their ears up when I say that because they don't understand it. They think about France, they think about the United States, but very rarely do we, as a country that has only been federated for 122 years, look upon ourselves as one of the longest-serving, continuous forms of democracy. But we are. That is a fact.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The importance of this vote for this referendum and this moment should not be understated. At the beginning of April, in my own electorate, I asked about 30,000 electors in Fisher, subscribers or anybody who has contacted my office, what they thought of the Voice. I have come in for some criticism on this point because some people think that everybody who has contacted my office is a supporter of mine. Anybody who's been an MP would know that many people who contact your office don't ring you up or email you to say you're doing a great job, unless, of course, it's you, Mr Deputy Speaker, because I know all your constituents would love you and think you're doing a wonderful job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that many people contact you because they don't like what you're doing or they don't like what your party is doing, so I don't accept that those 30,000 people that I have emails for are necessarily lovers of Andrew Wallace. When I sent those 30,000 emails out about the Voice, in less than 36 hours I got 3,000 responses—a 10 per cent response—and 72 per cent of voters indicated that they intended to vote no later this year. Their feedback overwhelmingly related to the divisive nature of the proposal and the risk that the proposal would hold Australia back, not propel us forward. The No. 1 concern, however, is the lack of information available to the public about the Voice: What is it? Who will it comprise? What will it actually do? It is the vast unknown that is worrying aspirational Australians the country over. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've made it clear to the people of Fisher that I will be voting no to Canberra's the Voice and yes to a better way forward. I will continue to consult my electorate as to their views because that's what people expect of those that they've elected. Australians expect their representatives to consult, to be representative, and they expect their MPs to have the courage to do what is right, not what activists demand or what is, necessarily, politically correct. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In considering the bill before us today, I share the concerns of my electorate about what the Voice will do and, just as importantly, what it won't do. As I have mentioned, there are serious questions about this great unknown that we cannot leave unanswered. Every word of our Constitution can be and, in fact, is open to interpretation by the High Court. That's one of the reasons that the threshold for changing it is so high. We've only had eight successful referendums out of 44. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are very conservative, in the true sense of the term, when it comes to changing the constitution. Why? Because what you enshrine in the Constitution will become a permanent fixture. It's not just a piece of legislation where, if we try something and we don't like it, we can just legislate to go back to the way it was or amend it to try and improve it. Once we enshrine something in the Constitution, it is there forever and would require another referendum to change it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Voice, in my view, will open a legal can of worms, allowing the High Court to affect the function of an elected government without remedy. Legal experts are already at loggerheads about how the Voice will work. Even the government's own constitutional expert group could not reach agreement on what this constitutional change would do. How will it impact parliament? How will it impact the executive? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We may find ourselves in a situation where the Voice reaches into the Reserve Bank, Centrelink, Defence or our schools. It is undeniable that the 'yes' campaign are at loggerheads with each other. The Prime Minister says that this is a modest change that will only impact upon laws affecting Indigenous Australians. Professor Megan Davis, however, says that it will cover the field. There is not one law that passes or is considered by this place that does not impact upon Indigenous Australians. That is a fact. When we pass laws in this place we do not pass laws for Indigenous Australians on the one hand and non-Indigenous Australians on the other. We pass laws for Australians. Every single law that we pass in this place impacts upon all Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An Indigenous representative group with unlimited scope means a bigger government, more bureaucrats and, in my view, worse outcomes. We risk a long-term legal logjam in dysfunction right across the public sector. As Ian Callinan AC KC, a former High Court judge, said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… I would foresee a decade or more of constitutional and administrative law litigation arising out of the Voice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst I am certainly not anywhere near Justice Callinan's experience, as a barrister of 22 years I absolutely agree with Justice Callinan's views on this. Canberra doesn't need to get busier, bigger, richer or louder. People want government to step back, shut up and butt out of their lives, not have greater control. They want to get on with building, creating, working, innovating, caring, raising, leading and transforming. They want to be productive. Bureaucracy only slows things down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Equality of citizenship is at the core of our egalitarian nation. A person's sex, religion, race or political affiliation should not impact on their ability to determine their own future or to vote in accordance with their conscience. By creating a constitutionally enshrined body elected by and for a particular ethnic group, we are permanently dividing our country along racial lines. We are destroying the equality of citizenship in one fell swoop, and it will be everyday Australians of all ethnicities who pay the price.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is contending with the most geopolitically unstable period since the end of World War II. China poses an enormous economic, military and national security threat. Russia backs it. Theocracies, tyrants and terrorists from the Middle East through to South-East Asia want nothing more than to bring down our nation and the West more broadly. In facing these multifaceted challenges, governments and legislators of all shapes and sizes should be bringing Australians together. Now is the time for national unity, not government funded racial division. The Voice will be a permanent publicly funded body for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders that has additional rights embedded in our Constitution. Those rights will be procedural rights to make representations to the parliament and the executive government in relation to everything. Those rights will be afforded not because of fairness or equality or justice but because of someone's race. At its core, the Voice is divisive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The simple proposition of whether we are willing to divide our country along the lines of race is something we should all examine closely. The coalition does not believe that is what Australians want. This top down, elite Canberra voice does nothing to help Indigenous communities on the ground in rural and regional Australia, who want to build better lives for themselves and their families. There would not be a person in this place who does not want better outcomes for our Indigenous Australians. But when it comes to closing the gaps in health case, education, employment and justice, the solution is local development, not more politics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the so-called woke elites call for another layer of bureaucracy, Indigenous children face the most inconceivable abuse. How will the Voice keep kids safe? While Canberra talks about bureaucracy, more public spending and duplicated services, Australian families and their businesses are crumpling under the weight of Labor's cost-of-living crisis. How will the Voice help Australians make ends meet? Our nation faces existential threats from those who would do us harm in and beyond the Indo-Pacific. How will the Voice help us secure or borders, boost sovereign defence capability or protect Australians and their interests online? It won't. We don't know what it will do. But we know what it won't do. The Voice won't help Australians. In particular, in my view, it will not help Indigenous Australians living in rural, remote Australia a single bit. It won't help Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians a single iota. More bureaucracy in Canberra means less investment in Aboriginal communities. It means more elites at decision-making tables and less decisions being made on the ground.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a better way forward. All parties of government recognise the need for constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. But instead of constitutional recognition, Labor have chosen to make this referendum an opportunity to radically and irreconcilably damage our democracy. After six years of Labor's platitudes, we delivered nine years of targeted investment into closing the gap, supporting Indigenous communities and creating opportunities for meaningful representation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We recognise there is a place in this country for bodies to serve as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voices, but we don't want to see another Canberra based voice. We need local and regional voices—the same kinds of voices recommended by the co-design process by Professors Tom Calma and Marcia Langton. They are bodies embedded in local communities and regions established at the grassroots level.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our position is clear. We support the Australian people having their say but we do not support this risky, divisive— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

It's a journey that began long ago in this place. As former prime minister Gough Whitlam so eloquently said, 'All of us as Australians are diminished while Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are denied their rightful place in this nation.' This bill is about recognition for First Nations people. It's about building a better nation for all Australians.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that for too long First Nations people have suffered from inequity. For too long First Nations people have listened to parliament speak about them rather than with them. And for too long First Nations people have experienced high levels of incarceration, poor educational outcomes and low life expectancy. No Australian should be proud of this. It's time for change. We must try a different path. This bill represents that different path.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill provides recognition through a new chapter in our Constitution. It will establish a First Nations advisory body to make representations to parliament and the executive government. It will be a new chapter not just in our Constitution but in our nation's history, one built on extensive consultation with our First Nations peoples.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Minister for Indigenous Australians stated in this place earlier today, just over six years ago the spirit of this bill was supported by an overwhelming majority of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander delegates who gathered from all points under the southern sky to endorse the Uluru Statement from the Heart. Throughout that process, and those that followed, the constitutional amendment provided through this bill will rectify over 120 years of explicit exclusion from Australia's founding legal document for our First Nations people. The Voice and constitutional recognition provide an opportunity to acknowledge our history and come together for a more reconciled future—a future where our founding document recognises that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have occupied this country for more than 60,000 years and represent the oldest continuous culture in human history, a future where our founding document recognises that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have maintained a relationship with land, waters and sky since time immemorial. This bill for a referendum is an acknowledgement of that history, and, if successful, the Voice to Parliament will provide an enduring platform from which First Nations people can make representation to the parliament on matters that affect them. It makes absolute sense.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have met with First Nations representatives in my region from the Wathaurong Aboriginal Co-operative and the Wathaurong. They are united in their support for the Voice. And I stand side by side with them and thank them for the many conversations we have had. Later this year we will hold a referendum where we will ask the people of Australia to vote on a voice to parliament. This will be an historic moment. We must embrace it. I look forward to the many robust and constructive conversations that I will have in the lead-up to this vote. Now is the time to take the next step and seize the day. In the words of my colleague Senator Patrick Dodson when asked about the timing of this referendum, he said, 'If not now, when? We have been talking about recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians in our founding document for decades. Now we have the chance to do it. Let's seize the moment; let's take Australia forward, for everyone.' This bill will enable us to do that.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Constitution Alteration (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice) 2023 proposes to insert a new chapter 9, entitled 'Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples'. The introductory words recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the first peoples of Australia. The words reflect the fact that establishing the Voice is an act of recognition in the manner the delegates at Uluru sought in 2017. Subsection 129(i) provides for the establishment of the Voice. This provision will ensure the Voice is an enduring institution, allowing it to be independent from government and effectively represent views of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people at the national level. The Voice will be an independent representative body. The intention is that its members will be selected by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people based on the wishes of local communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Subsection 129(ii) sets out the primary function of the Voice: making representations to the parliament and the executive government about matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples could include    matters specific to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples; and matters relevant to the Australian community, including general laws or measures, but which affect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples differently to other members of the Australian community. The Voice will not be required to make a representation on every law, policy or program. The Voice will determine when to make representations by managing its own priorities and allocating its resources in accordance with the priorities of First Nations people. Critically, the Voice will be proactive. It will not have to wait for the parliament or the executive to seek its views before it can provide them, nor will the constitutional amendment oblige the parliament nor the executive government to consult the Voice before taking action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Voice will provide a path for the executive government and the parliament to consult with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The Voice will create a critical link between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, the parliament and the executive government. Nothing in the provision will hinder the ordinary functioning of the democratic system. While the constitutional nature of the body and its expertise in matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples would give weight to the representations of the Voice, those representations would be advisory in nature. It will be a matter for the parliament to determine whether the executive government is under any obligation in relation to representations made by the Voice. There will be no requirement for the parliament or the executive government to follow the Voice's representations. The constitutional amendment confers no power on the Voice to prevent, delay or veto decisions of the parliament or the executive government. The parliament and the executive government will retain final decision-making powers over all laws and policies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Voice will enhance our democracy and our democratic institutions. Its representations will ensure the laws, policies and programs from the parliament and the executive are better targeted and more successful. Subsection (iii) provides the parliament with broader power to make laws about matters relating to the Voice. This provision will ensure the Voice can evolve to meet the future needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and Australia as a whole. The matters on which the parliament will have power to make laws include processes to select Voice members, the way the Voice performs, its representation-making functions, its potential future functions, the power it needs to carry out those functions; and its procedures, including the mechanics of its relationship with the parliament and the executive government, such as how the parliament and the executive government would receive representations from the Voice. After the referendum, the final details of how the Voice will operate will be settled and legislation will be debated in this parliament.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am confident the majority of Australians, just like me, want the legitimate voice of First Nations people acknowledged in the Constitution and heard by our nation's parliament and executive government. In closing, Uluru Statement from the Heart asks Australians to walk together to build a better future by establishing a First Nations Voice to Parliament. This bill presents an opportunity to uplift our entire nation, to repair the injustices of the past and to provide a better way forward to close the gap. We must seize this opportunity with both hands. As said in the Uluru Statement from the Heart:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 1967 we were counted, in 2017 we seek to be heard. We leave base camp and start our trek across this vast country. We invite you to walk with us in a movement of the Australian people for a better future.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is now 2023. It is time to accept this generous invitation in the Uluru Statement from the Heart. It is time to listen. It is time to act. We have nothing to lose and everything to gain by voting yes for a better future for all Australians.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="008CH" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms DANIEL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:32</span>):  I acknowledge and pay my respects to the Ngunnawal and Ngambri peoples, on whose ancestral lands we meet. I also acknowledge the Bunurong and Boonwurrung people of the Kulin nation, the traditional custodians of the land on which my electorate of Goldstein sits, on the shores of Naarm, the bay. The Boonwurrung dreaming is told through Bunjil the eagle as the creator of the Kulin people. I pay my respects to their elders past and present, and I extend my respects to any First Nations people in the chamber and watching today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Across Goldstein there are signs of the thousands of years of Indigenous history, with shell middens, for example, spreading along the coast in all directions from Dendy Street through Sandringham to Ricketts Point and beyond. Confrontingly, this history also reflects the fact that the Boonwurrung were all but wiped out by European settlement. Conflict with sealers, as well as the diseases they brought to our shores, devastated these First Nations coastal communities to the extent that there may be less than 100 Boonwurrung people left by the 1840s. I thank the descendants of these people for their interactions with me and their support for the Voice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For 60,000 years at least, the original inhabitants of this continent had stewardship of the land, the air above, what lay beneath their feet and the seas that surrounded what is now Australia. In 1788, we didn't seek their permission to take custody; in fact, we denied their millennia of ownership. That is the fundamental reason we're here today—to help right a wrong. When the Mabo legislation passed this parliament in the hours before Christmas in 1993, then opposition leader John Hewson declared it a day of shame—words I'm sure he regrets today. Mabo did not lead to the end of the world as we know it, and nor will this, but here we are again, so let's have the conversation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've consulted widely in the lead-up to this debate, and not just with the usual suspects. For example, I reached out to Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price to understand her concerns about what the Voice will mean. I listened and particularly heard her concerns that diverse voices of local, regional and remote communities must be heard, particularly women in those communities. So I'm pleased that the Minister for Indigenous Australians has now made it explicit that local and regional voices will be integral to the eventual structure of the Voice. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've also listened intently and observed the comments of the member for Berowra, who says he'll vote yes even, as he argues, that the reference to executive government should be dropped in this constitutional amendment. The member is saying that removing the term 'executive government' from the legislation will improve the referendum's prospects of success. I fear it will do the reverse. I understand the member for Berowra's good-faith intention to alleviate the concerns of some, but I fear that such a change will undermine confidence in the point of all of this, among all Australians but particularly First Nations Australians, who rightly desire something more than symbolism. And there is no sign from the Leader of the Opposition, certainly not in his speech today, that such a change would mean he would get wholeheartedly behind the referendum. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This constitutional change is the result of years of work by Indigenous communities and leaders, parliamentarians and constitutional lawyers. As respected lawyer Anne Twomey has said more than once, this time in a submission to the joint select committee reviewing this legislation, there is no obligation upon parliament or the executive government to respond to the representations or give effect to them. There is no obligation of prior consultation. There is no requirement to wait to receive a representation before the executive government of parliament can act. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Voice is a simple proposition, a simple and generous invitation that's being turned into a complicated question, at least partly, for political reasons. If we do not accept it now, then when? The forthcoming referendum will allow us to recognise First Nations people in our Constitution and, then, to give First Nations people a say in the formulation of the policies and laws that affect them. It's as simple as that. There will be hurdles. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Already, we've seen information manipulated and deliberate omission of information during the political discourse. This is something that as a journalist and foreign correspondent I saw time and time again. In many ways, together with climate change, I see it as an existential threat. Democratic processes should be free, fair and trusted, and conversations should be reasoned and void of scare campaigns. This conversation is about a simple truth: acknowledging that First Nations people were the original custodians of this continent. It begins a process that will allow us to recognise First Nations people in our Constitution. If we don't do it now, I firmly believe it will be decades before we get the opportunity again. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This once-in-a-generation referendum rests on the framework of the Uluru Statement from the Heart and its three pillars: voice, treaty, truth. In short, from where I stand, the referendum is about three principles: respect, recognition, results—practical, tangible results to close the gap for First Nations communities. This is a gap that, by listening and hearing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, I do believe we can begin to bridge, through firsthand advice to parliament from First Nations people, through the Voice. It should be built from the ground up rather than from the top down, as the most prominent advocates have noted. That's been one of the biggest problems in the policies and programs for First Nations peoples to date. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This referendum is the culmination of 20 years of patient effort by our First Nations citizens in the face of great challenges. I note, in this context, the very current experience of my former colleague Stan Grant, who will step down from his role hosting Q&amp;A, having spoken his truth, as he says hard truths not told with hate, and being judged for it and not supported through it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was struck when reading an article about various efforts to give Indigenous Australians representation that the first Indigenous advisory body, the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee, was announced by the Whitlam government in the year of my birth, 1972. That's more than 50 years ago. To get to this point has been a long and winding road. Indigenous peoples have been seeking constitutional recognition since the 1920s. The 1999 referendum, the last to be presented to the Australian people, rejected a preamble proposed by John Howard. In 2000, the final report of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation recommended a constitutional amendment to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the first peoples of Australia. In 2012, the expert panel proposed recognition. Likewise, in 2015, the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples did the same, without dissent. In 2015, the then Prime Minister established the Referendum Council, which, among other things, engaged with 13 regional dialogues. Their one unanimous finding: that Indigenous people sought a constitutionally protected voice to parliament. In 2017, Uluru Statement from the Heart could hardly have been clearer, with an overwhelming majority of participants calling for the establishment of a First Nations Voice enshrined in the Constitution. This legislation honours that appeal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition is critical of the notion that the Voice should have access to executive government—specifically, section 129(ii):</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice may make representations to the Parliament and the Executive Government of the Commonwealth on matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, according to the Indigenous and legal experts I've consulted, as well as Indigenous members of the community, that is precisely the point. Too often, Indigenous representatives say, representative bodies have been created and abolished at the stroke of a pen—four of them since 1973: Whitlam's National Aboriginal Consultative Committee, Fraser's National Aboriginal Conference, Hawke's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, and, finally, the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples. All came; all gone. A key aim of this referendum is to enshrine the Voice in the Constitution so it's not subject to the ebbs and flows of party politics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Uluru Statement from the Heart was first read out in 2017. That's six years ago that an invitation was issued. And what have we got so far? Eleven of the 15 Closing the Gap targets are still not on track. And one of the reasons, according to First Nations leaders, has been the lack of access to the executive—that too many of the approaches to government have got lost or withered within the bureaucracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition leader is particularly troubled that the Voice will have access to the executive, arguing that it'll be able to make representations on any matter—that there is an obligation on the government: to advise the Voice in advance before making any law or policy relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, not to make any law before receiving a representation, to consider any representation and to give effect to representations when making any law or policy. Constitutional expert Anne Twomey says this is just not true. In her submission to the joint select committee set up to report on this legislation, she says:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">1. No such obligation is contained or can find its source in the text of the amendment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">2. The intent of the amendment, as expressed in official documents, does not support any such obligation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">3. The history of the development of the amendment does not support any such obligation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this regard, she points to the careful use of the word 'may' in section 129(ii), as well as words that are absent:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">For example, the word 'consultation' was not used, as it might convey an obligation on the part of the Executive Government or Parliament to consult the Voice prior to making decisions. The word 'advice' was also rejected, lest it be interpreted as binding …</span>

The very Dreaming of Bundjil the eagle, which created the Kulin nation of Goldstein, and all the Dreamings that underpin thousands of years of our history are not present.</span>

                    <a href="HVO" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:45</span>):  Some years ago, the High Court of this country destroyed the legal fiction of terra nullius, in a decision called Mabo. Human habitation on this continent we call Australia didn't happen when Captain Cook showed a bit of interest in the place on the east coast in 1770, nor when Captain Phillip decided to take a bit of interest and establish a convict settlement around the Sydney area in 1788. Nor did it happen when Australia was federated, and the likes of Edmund Barton and Alfred Deakin and company drafted a constitution and convinced the government of the United Kingdom that we should federate as six states in 1901.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although in many ways it has served us well, the tragedy of our Constitution is that there were no women present during the conferences and conventions that led to the Constitution. There were hardly any Labor people present, I might add, nor any trade unionists. And there were certainly no First Nations people present. Indeed, the Constitution is reflective of the view of many in the late 19th century that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were a dying race. They had been disadvantaged, dispossessed and discriminated against. They were the subject of the Frontier Wars and slaughtered in places around the country. These are things that were not unknown at the time. There were newspaper reports and governmental reports about them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1901 we federated, and we didn't contemplate or recognise First Nations habitation and the cultures and the 250 languages that were spoken at the time of Federation. Indeed, the Constitution has racist provisions in it. Section 25 contemplates that the states can pass laws to prevent any races from voting, and persons excluded by that would not be counted for the purpose of representation in the House of Representatives. Section 51(xxvi) has been used on numerous occasions—in fact, almost every occasion—to discriminate against Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We have seen that again and again. We have very few protections. I have always been a big believer in a bill of rights. I have always been a believer in a charter of rights, if not a bill of rights, and our Constitution has very few of those.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a bit of history in this space. I was the Chair of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs in the House of Representatives. I was also the shadow minister for Indigenous affairs. I was a member of the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, chaired by the Hon. Ken Wyatt, which came up with many good recommendations and which backed in the expert panel that had been appointed by Julia Gillard and had such eminent persons on it as now senator Patrick Dodson and others. We had, of course, another joint select committee established. I'm a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which has looked at the legislation to deal with this referendum proposal. I have recently been with the member for Dunkley and others on the Joint Select Committee on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice Referendum. I've heard the legal experts—Anne Twomey, George Williams, former chief justice Robert French and others—and people who have some concerns, like Greg Craven, Frank Brennan and others, but this referendum is gracious, simple and profound, as Shireen Morris and Noel Pearson said in their submission to that joint select committee on the voice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Constitutional change is hard. In this country we've engaged in cooperative federalism or judicial activism of the High Court, which has original jurisdiction in a whole range of areas. So the notion that somehow the High Court can't interpret issues in relation to the Constitution and issues of justiciability is a fiction and a nonsense. There are those who would perpetuate and perpetrate that nonsense.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we have some challenges in getting constitutional change. Section 128 requires a double majority—a majority of votes in a majority of states. We need that to get this referendum up. It's very important that we look at the history of this. This is not a new thing. We had in 2017 over 250 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders gather at Uluru for a national constitutional convention. There have been literally hundreds of First Nations regional dialogues. The dialogues engaged 1,200 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander delegates from traditional owner groups and community organisations and key individuals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This idea that somehow the referendum comes from nothing is rubbish. It does mimic in many ways the many constitutional conventions that led up to Federation in 1901. We've had interim reports and final reports on a whole range of issues dealing with constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There will be a new section 129. The wording for new subsections (i), (ii) and (iii) is gracious, simple and easy to understand. 'In recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Peoples of Australia' is simply a statement of the obvious, but it's important because the Constitution doesn't have that. The only time a symbolic attempt was made in a referendum in John Howard's tenure as Prime Minister it didn't have substantial change and the people of Australia voted it down. We need some form of symbolic recognition, but a change that will be substantive, real, practical and pragmatic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Subsection (ii) says the Voice, the body, 'may make representations'. It's an advisory type capacity. There is no compulsion on the parliament or the executive government to adhere to that voice. In fact, that idea of a duty of the parliament and the executive government to adhere to or follow that representation was discounted by legal expert after legal expert from the Law Council to Professor Anne Twomey and Professor George Williams. Bret Walker SC said that the idea that somehow this would hold up or delay legislation and that the courts would be clogged was 'too silly for words'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Subsection (iii) of the change gives this pre-eminent power to the parliament and says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws with respect to matters relating to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice, including its composition, functions, powers and procedures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the parliament is pre-eminent under the Constitution. This is not a deliberative or a legislative body. It's really a body that makes representations. It's not an Indigenous house of lords, as some have said. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you look at the proposal you see that it is simple, easy and concise, but it has practical implications. The Voice will be replicated in terms of input from regional areas. We know that when Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have a say and input—for example, when they have a community controlled health service like IUIH in Queensland, my home state—that's when we have better practical outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We've seen it again and again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The idea that the Voice can just make representations to, say, a minister of state without dealing with senior public servants who have executive responsibility in programs, policies and outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is a nonsense. It's not good enough. The idea that somehow this Voice will be dealing with all manner of aspects of executive government is limited by the fact that it's concerning matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think there are many, many good things that are in this constitutional proposal. I want to praise Professor Tom Calma AO and Professor Marcia Langton AO for the co-design process and the leadership they show in this space. They've done a very, very good job. I also want to thank the Law Council of Australia, who have done a mighty job in their submission. I encourage anyone who may be listening to this debate to have a look at their submission and the submission made by Noel Pearson and Shireen Morris to the joint select committee looking at the Voice. The core function of the Voice is to make those representations on matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The proposed constitutional change performs an important role in identifying and therefore providing that constitutional guarantee for a core function of the Voice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to deal with the issue of justiciability. This idea that somehow there would be no judicial determinations, this principle of justiciability, is not an issue that's foreign to the High Court. Since 1901, the High Court has had original jurisdiction in all matters arising out of the Constitution and involving its interpretation. Judicial review is not done for every single element of government decision-making or error in government. There are many issues which the High Court will not evaluate. There are many issues where the High Court will identify whether a question is considered appropriate or fit for judicial determination. This is not a new concept. But, if you listen to those opposite and some of the naysayers in this debate, you would think that that's really doomsday stuff. The jeremiads coming from those opposite and some other people in relation to this issue deny the historical reality and the function of the High Court of Australia and what it's done. This is a longstanding legal and constitutional responsibility of the High Court of Australia. We should trust the High Court, as we've done for a century and 20-odd years, to make decisions in the best interests and to perform its function in all matters of constitutional law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Law Council have said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The actions of Parliament concerning its relationship with the Voice would, in the above context, be considered non-justiciable … it does not create an explicit, nor an implied, obligation on Parliament to consider or respond to those representations … the High Court has held that the exercise by Parliament of its own law-making procedures is non-justiciable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's really critical in case after case after case. So this nonsense that somehow the High Court and the legal system would be blocked and somehow the Voice would have a veto over the operation of the parliament and the executive government doesn't bear reality given the actual constitutional proposals being put. This is an advisory body that makes representations and provides views to parliament in relation to proposed or existing laws or policies relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. That's the context.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an amendment to our Constitution which is legally sound and balanced, according to Noel Pearson and Shireen Morris, and it has benefited from nine years of refinement, streamlining and simplification of the provisions. It is not a radical change, but it is a substantive change to our Constitution that is about consultation and recognition of the people of this continent who have been forgotten, disadvantaged, discriminated against and subject to violence and expulsion from their land and the destruction of their language and their culture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The constitutional opportunity we have cannot and must not be abandoned. We have a great opportunity in this country to do the right thing. I cannot conceive how we would feel as a country, how it would set back closing the gap, how it would set back the cause of reconciliation and unity as a people, if, on the Sunday after this vote, we're in a position where we have voted no as a country. How will we be considered internationally? How will Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who've been on this continent feel if their fellow Australians vote no?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would encourage all my constituents in Blair and everyone around the country to do the right thing. Consult with each other; consult with First Nations people; recognise them in the Constitution.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:01</span>):  I have probably had more chances than most to speak on the Constitution Alteration (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice) 2023. Being the deputy chair of the Joint Select Committee on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice Referendum, I had the chance to speak earlier today. I stand conscious of that and am keen to hear from my colleagues on both sides of the House, who should be heard on this really important issue. I acknowledge the member for Blair, who's just left; the member for Dunkley; and, previously, the member for Cowper. All three were on the committee with me.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were 13 members on the committee, from both parties—in fact, three parties and a crossbench member. We may come to different conclusions at the end of this process, and they're reflected in various reports, but I think the member for Dunkley will agree we treated each other with respect and dignity and heard each other out. My plea, as this decision leaves this place, goes to the Senate and then ultimately goes out to the Australian people, is that the Australian people treat each other with dignity and respect in the same way. In addition to how we may feel the day after the referendum, how we treat each other in this process is important. The day after the referendum, whatever the result, the Australian people will have got it right. That's what we accept in a democracy. That's what happens in every election. We lost the Federal election last year; the Australian people got it right. We must accept that. That may seem like an obvious statement, but there are examples around other democracies where that's not obvious. People need to be reminded. I'm worried, when I see some of the commentary in this debate from both sides, that there needs to be some heat taken out. There are some very good people on both sides who have had their motives and even their own personality and history questioned for taking a view that others disagree with—again, on both sides.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier, when I spoke about the report, I mentioned an example where my party had its rural state conference at Bendigo on the weekend, and it is fair to say that most members of the party are against the proposal as put, but not all. A young man got up and, in a forum, put his case for why we should support the Voice. I was on the panel, and I was struck by his courage and his conviction that, in a room where he knew that most people would not agree with him, he felt he had to stand up for what he believed in. The room applauded him. I think that was a sign of the Liberal Party at its best.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side, my friend sitting next to me, the member for Bass; my other friend the member for Berowra; and senators that might have views in the other place have different views. I respect and honour them for their courage and their conviction because they are an example of how we can have a deeply held, passionate view yet still ultimately disagree. Like most issues, these things aren't black and white. There are shades of grey. In fact, most reasonable people will acknowledge the great honour that we have of our Indigenous heritage, the significant injustices and disadvantages, historically and present day, that Indigenous Australians suffer. Just about all reasonable Australians agree with that. But what we're looking at here, in these words and in this proposal, is whether and how we amend our Constitution.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand the argument that this is the offer that we have before us. I understand that. I also understand the argument that a lot of things haven't worked before, so let's try something new. I understand that too. But that doesn't mean we should not seriously and properly assess the potential of unintended consequences for amending our Constitution. Because we are one of the most stable and successful democracies on Earth. We're not perfect. No-one pretends we're perfect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When many speak of some of the principles and ideas that are guiding their vote, including equality of citizenship—I say the aspiration of 'equality of citizenship' because I also acknowledge that in our Constitution are some odious provisions, like section 25, which belong in another century and another time. They should be removed. There's bipartisan support for that. But what section 25 shows us is that our Constitution is permanent in effect. It's very hard to change it. If we want to try something different and something new, for all the good intentions that come with that, if there are unintended consequences it is very hard to undo.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For many of the aspirations and goals that I've heard in speeches from the other side, and from my friends here, there are ways to achieve those without the constitutional risk—that is, through legislation and other means. And that includes the Voice to the executive. I understand why a Voice would want to make representations to the executive. I understand that. But there are ways to do that through legislation. There are ways to do that in many other respects that reasonable people in this place could agree on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The key ingredient for our stable and successful democracy is our Constitution. The member for Blair referred to his aspiration for a bill of rights. That is a debate for another time, but one of the issues with a bill of rights isn't really the contents of the rights, which we can all aspire to, it's about who decides. Because when something is added to our Constitution, ultimately it is for the High Court to decide, not this place. So, bit by bit, whether it's a bill of rights or other amendments, there is, in effect, a transfer of power from this place—the people's house, the heart of our democracy—up the road to the High Court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The High Court is an important branch of government, but unlike the United States, which has a bill of rights—the consequences of that sees people and protesters march up the National Mall, past the Congress and around the back to the Supreme Court. That's where they seek to have their opinions heard. Many have often reflected that for political decisions, for moral decisions, it should be the people's house—and in that place it's the Congress where those decisions are heard. I think one of our strengths is that we don't have a bill of rights in our Constitution, and I say that in response to the member for Blair's submission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Section 75(v) of our Constitution entrenches the High Court's jurisdiction to conduct judicial review of executive action undertaken by officers of the Commonwealth. The primary issue that the joint committee had to deal with was whether the government's proposed amendment to the Constitution will generate grounds for judicial review of executive action under section 75(v). In short, the question is this: could the High Court interpret the proposed new chapter of the Constitution in a way that imposes duties on the executive? None of us—no professor, no constitutional silk, no former judge—can answer that question conclusively. They are all giving their best guess. They do so in good faith with opinions that are sincerely held, but none of them will truly know.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many examples through our constitutional history where the High Court took a turn that no-one in this place or in academia or those who made the submissions or others who were on the court would have guessed. We have seen many in my lifetime as a lawyer—I still consider myself a baby lawyer. Just a few examples were: the decisions of Kable and DPP, where the High Court struck down legislation that attempted to vest state courts with functions incompatible with chapter III; Langley and the Commonwealth, where the High Court held that the Constitution contains an implicit protection of freedom of communication between the people concerning political and government matters; the cases of Roach, Lane and Morrison; and the more recent one of Love and the Commonwealth, where a majority of the High Court, quite unexpectedly, and to the surprise of the Solicitor-General at the time—this is in 2020—held that a man born in New Zealand and a citizen of that country could not be deported as an alien within the meaning of section 51(xix) of the Constitution, because he descended from an identified person of Aboriginal descent. The majority reached this conclusion because of an assessed special cultural, historical and spiritual connection with the territory of Australia. No-one can deny those words that were mentioned in the majority, but they don't appear in the text of our Constitution. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look at the three parts that are proposed, it is part II that has drawn the most concern from this side and from many of those who made submissions to the committee. I would not and will never pretend that that risk is a veto. That is an erroneous submission and claim for anyone to make. The two duties are as follows: there is the potential for the High Court to find either a duty to consult in advance of decisions that are pending or a duty to consider the representations that are being made by the Voice. These twin duties aren't pulled out of thin air; they're quite common in the area of administrative law. They guide many of the areas that nonlawyers are familiar with, including the area of migration, where decisions made by the minister are reviewable not because there is a veto on the decision of the minister but that the minister hasn't properly considered all of the materials for that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You may ask, 'What's the big deal, if the executive still gets to make the decision after it's forced to hear a representation?' The big deal is that it's a huge administrative burden. When you read the explanatory memorandum and the Attorney-General's second reading speech, he makes it very clear that that's not the intent of the government. It's not your intent. So what we're talking about is whether the words reflect the intent of the government. In the dissenting report, there are four options put forward where we submit, based on expert evidence, that you could better reflect that intent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many have stood up here and said, 'Don't worry, part III'—which gives power to this place, talking about the powers, functions and procedures of the Voice—'is what checks this potential risk you're talking about in part II.' There's a problem with that. The problem is part III says 'subject to this Constitution'. So if the High Court finds one of those two duties, to consult or consider in part II—and they can find it in one of two ways, on an express reading of the words or by implication—then there's no law that we can pass in this place that can fix that. We can't, because it's subject to this Constitution. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even if the submission is right, that part III has that power, when I ask this question, 'What is it in part II that you are defending so strongly?' why are you fighting so hard to defend it? Why is it there? If part III gives this place absolute power over whether those obligations may arise, then it doesn't do anything, and you could very well legislate a voice to the executive through part III. My good friend the member for Berowra has been a long, passionate advocate for reconciliation, and that's the point he made in his Press Club speech. It's a valid question that has not been answered. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I said I would defer and yield my time to others because I have had a lot already. This is a decision that the Australian people will make. Whether their vote is yes, no or unsure, I commit to honouring that. I commit to respecting the views of those who disagree with me. I encourage all of us in this place, in the media, in social media, that wherever we see insults, wherever we see invective, wherever we see people revert to attacking the person and not the ideas, we should all step in and stop them, like that young man at the state council who took a risk to stand up. I say to those in corporate Australia, to our sporting codes, to families, to people at dinner parties: let's respect each other as Australians and get through this. At the other end, we know, the Australian people will have made the right decision.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Constitution Alteration (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice) Bill 2023 is an opportunity for our country. It is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to make Australia a better place by delivering constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people through the Voice to Parliament. It comes after decades of work from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and also from others who have worked alongside them advocating for constitutional change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course we know that constitutional change in our country isn't easy. This will be our first referendum in 24 years, and it does seem a little daunting. But when we see past the fear of doing something differently we can see the opportunity that is there. I can see our country on the other side of this referendum, where we wake up, having successfully taken up the invitation that is in the Uluru Statement from the Heart. That statement was the work of First Nations people holding dialogues across the country culminating in a summit at Uluru on the 50th anniversary of the 1967 referendum. It called for the establishment of a First Nations voice to parliament and concludes with the invitation:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 1967 we were counted, in 2017 we seek to be heard. We leave base camp and start our trek across this vast country. We invite you to walk with us in a movement of the Australian people for a better future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At its core, constitutional recognition through the Voice is about two key things: recognition and listening. It's a recognition that after all this time Australia's First Peoples should have a significant place in our 122-year-old Constitution. As Professor Megan Davis has said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It's a recognition of First Nations voices as being important to the nation. It's recognition that the descendants of the ancient peoples who arrived here 60,000 to 70,000 years ago are still here, have survived and [are] speaking with their voice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The concept of First Nations people having a place in the Constitution is not a new one. From the petitions of William Cooper to the Yirrkala bark petitions, the Barunga Statement and much more, First Nations people have long called for a greater say over their own lives. I was struck recently when I was reading Shireen Morris's observation in <span style="font-style:italic;">Statements </span><span style="font-style:italic;">from the</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Soul</span> that in fact the Australian Constitution is all about voices. Shireen writes:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the federal system provides mechanisms for the historical political communities (the former colonies) to always be heard by the might of the majority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst the colonies or the states got provisions for their voices to be heard in the original drafting of our Constitution and the make-up of our Senate, First Nations people did not get that position in the original drafting of our Constitution. That's the opportunity that is before us—to have their voice heard in our Constitution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a radical proposition. It is adding a voice to our Constitution—a voice that could have been included from the start—the inclusion of which now gives us a chance to address the injustices of the past and to create change that will make things better now and into the future. It is our country listening to First Nations people and their calls to have a real say over their own lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, the proposal before us not a radical one. The Voice will not have veto power. It will be an advisory body. As the Attorney-General has set out, it creates an independent institution that speaks to the parliament and the executive government but does not replace, direct or impede the actions of either. The Voice will provide a path for the executive government and the parliament to consult with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It will create a link between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, the parliament and the executive government, and its members will be selected by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples based on the wishes of local communities. Putting the Voice in our Constitution ensures that this link I've been talking about is enduring. It ensures it is something that becomes part of the fabric of our country and how we do business going forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need that because, despite the efforts of successive governments, our efforts to close the gap have not been successful: 11 of the 15 Closing the Gap targets are not on track. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are still locked up at a rate that makes them proportionally the most incarcerated people on the planet, and I note we had the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, the report of which was released in 1991. It's a long time ago. But many of its recommendations still haven't been implemented, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people continue to die in custody at unacceptable rates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So when the Leader of the Opposition frames part of his opposition to the Voice around saying that he would rather have a royal commission, I have to ask: what does he think would be different about that process? When we have the example of the seminal royal commission that has still failed to change outcomes for people's lives, when we have decades of failed approaches behind us, why would we keep using the same failed approaches over and over again? The proposal before us has the backing of some of the most senior constitutional experts in our country. It is consistent with the advice of the Solicitor-General. It is time for us to take a new approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do have evidence that, when Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people do have a say over their own lives and futures, when they're involved in the design and implementation of policy and legislation that affect them, we get better outcomes. We see the results that come from things like Aboriginal community-controlled health services, which put Aboriginal health in Aboriginal hands. These are trusted services which are run with a real understanding of their communities. We see the Indigenous rangers programs, which not only protect country but also provide role models for people in their communities. They promote improved mental and physical health. They strengthen and enhance culture. They encourage more women into work. The Voice works on a similar principle—that, by giving people a direct say over their own lives, by giving people a direct say over how government works in their lives, we can improve their lives and those of the community they represent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home state of Victoria we are already seeing some of this approach in important work initiated by the Andrews government, the First Peoples' Assembly of Victoria. This is an independent body made up of traditional owners from across Victoria chosen by their communities to advance preparations for negotiations for treaties in Victoria. The assembly is advocating for a statewide treaty while also supporting and empowering traditional owner groups right across Victoria to negotiate specific treaties reflecting their priorities and wishes. Through a willingness to work together and to listen and engage in respectful discussion, the assembly has taken important steps forward. I look forward to the continued work of the First Peoples' Assembly and their progress towards treaties. There are important lessons for us at a federal level from this. It's an example of what we can achieve when we work together.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I began this speech with an acknowledgement of country. For me and those in my generation and older this is a practice that has only become widespread during our adult lifetimes, but for my five-year-old daughter it's something she started doing at kindergarten. She already knows about the Wurundjeri people and their connection to this country. The members of her generation are already trying to take up the opportunity the Uluru Statement from the Heart offers us to walk together for a better future. They can't vote yet, so they're relying on those of us who can to seize the opportunity to say yes to constitutional recognition that makes a real difference and improves lives, to say yes to recognising the amazing 65,000 years of history and continuous connection to this land and to wake up the day after the referendum to an Australia that has said yes to a more reconciled nation that is committed to making sure Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are heard so lives will be improved. We're not there yet. We know there is a lot of work to do to get a successful referendum and, in fact, get this bill through the parliament.</span>

In particular I note my colleagues in this parliament, including the father of reconciliation, Senator Patrick Dodson; the Minister for Indigenous Australians, the amazing Linda Burney; Senator Malarndirri McCarthy, the Assistant Minister for Indigenous Australians; and the First Nations members of our caucus.

He's a great guy and I'm very proud to know him and very pleased he has seen fit to share these words with me.

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:27</span>):  I want to start, tonight, by saying I'm a proud Australian who can trace her family's history in this country back to the First Fleet, which arrived in 1788. Members of my family forged pathways across this vast landscape. They helped build communities, drive industry, defend our shores and protect and assist those who needed help. I am proud of this history, and, indeed, I'm often inspired by it. But I also recognise it pales into insignificance when measured against those who were here before the arrival of the First Fleet—our First Nations people, who, science shows, have walked this land for over 60,000 years. In this context, I feel an extraordinary responsibility as I rise to speak, as North Sydney's representative, to the Constitution Alteration (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) Voice 2023. In doing so, I acknowledge that before 1788 my electorate on the north shore of Sydney was inhabited by two First Nations communities—the Cammeraygal and Wallumedegal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill enables an act to alter our Constitution to recognise the First Peoples of Australia by establishing an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voice. It is a bill which I believe many will look back on in years to come as they reflect on how our nation came to be where it is. It is a bill that I am unashamedly looking at as a proud Australian, as someone who wants my nation to be all it can be and my community to have a unifying expression of who we are, where we have come from and where we are striving to go.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the current debate seems to want to divide us, I believe there is one thing we are all united on—that is, regardless of our history, as we stand here today we are all Australian. I believe that for us to realise this truth, however, we must commit ourselves to living proudly in a reconciled fashion, with our shared history stretching back over 60,000 years. While this bill is not perfect, having looked at it and listened deeply to those who speak with authority about how it has come about, the ambitions and desires that supported its creation and the optimism that comes with it, I am convinced it represents a positive opportunity for us to move forward as a country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even so, there remain questions as to what this change will mean. In truth, as we stand here today, public opinion on its merits, needs and potential impacts is divided. As we move forward, then, I commit myself to facilitating respectful conversations that pursue a simple agenda of ensuring every Australian is confident of their own decision when it comes time to vote on the referendum. It seems like a simple thing to wish for for those who came before us: recognition and empowerment. From my perspective, it's a privilege to be a part of a generation that is prepared to step into this space and begin the process of evolving our nation into a land where we're all rightfully respected and connected through a shared history going back 60,000 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Uluru Statement from the Heart is not just a beautiful piece of writing; it is fundamentally an invitation to take part in a meaningful process of reconciliation. That starts with listening to our First Nations peoples, which is what this constitutional alteration enables. I want to specifically thank the First Nations leaders, activists and communities behind the Uluru Statement from the Heart—the Referendum Working Group, the Referendum Engagement Group and the Constitutional Expert Group—for their counsel and leadership.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When our Australian Constitution was first written, its creators were people—all men—from distinct communities who believed that, for the modern nation of Australia to grow, it needed a framework that enabled representatives from each area to negotiate and agree by consensus the best way for us to move forward. It took eight years for the Constitution to be drafted and two more for it to be ratified on 6 July 1900. While there was much to celebrate as the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act came into effect on 1 January 1901, it is noteworthy that not only were First Nations people not consulted or involved in the drafting of the Constitution; they were deliberately excluded. Not only did First Nations people have no say in the way the Commonwealth of Australia was to be governed; the Constitution specifically prevented Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples from even being counted as part of the Australian population. Regardless, First Nations people were bound by the law brought into place on that day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1967, then, the Constitution was amended to enable First Nations people to be counted amongst Australia's citizens and for this place to make laws specifically for First Nations people. But even then that change did not recognise the fact that, prior to white settlement, a nation consisting of 250 different mobs and countries already existed in this place. It is for this reason that, in 2023, we as a parliament and a people are trying to find a way to finally right what I believe is a longstanding injustice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that, since colonisation, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have experienced profound and continuing disadvantage. We may not like to speak of this history. It makes many people uncomfortable. But our constitutional history cannot be considered in isolation from the present levels of economic and social disadvantage suffered by a high proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. At almost every consultation conducted by the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Indigenous Australians, those levels of disadvantage and frustration with failed policies were raised. Indeed, the findings of the panel were unequivocal. The Closing the Gap statistics are by any standard a cause for concern. The best intentions of governments at all levels have failed to achieve acceptable results.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We find ourselves, then, at a juncture—one where I'm sure Einstein's famous words that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result have never been truer. We cannot rewrite our history, but we can decide to move forward with purpose, compassion and optimism. Facing the truth can be uncomfortable, but the truth is that, to address the fundamental, systemic and long-held exclusion of First Nations people in our country, we must do something differently. I hope the Voice to Parliament can be that something different.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a generation, by ensuring the Voice is enshrined in our Constitution, we are binding future generations to the same determination we feel today—a determination to ensure any change from this point forward is not just symbolic but substantive. This ask has come directly from First Nations people following a long and involved process of community consultation, seeking to improve the disadvantage faced by the communities. I believe all Australians would agree that any person impacted by specific laws should have the right to have a say in the development of those laws. In this context, I believe, then, that the majority of Australians would agree that First Nations people should have a say in the laws that directly affect them. It is this that is the ultimate purpose of the Voice—nothing more, nothing less.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To this end, I welcome the constitutional alteration proposed by this bill, and I support the recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Peoples of Australia. I also support the provision for the establishment of a new constitutional entity called the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice, because, in truth, our country is an outlier when compared to others worldwide. Constitutional or legal mechanisms recognising indigenous people are common globally, with many OECD and Commonwealth countries having made the move to ensure representation. In fact, the Parliamentary Library identified 44 states which have some mechanism for special representation, including countries like New Zealand, where the parliament has reserved seats for Maori people, or the Danish parliament, where they have established seats for Greenland. In this context, we can and should look to other countries who have a constitutionally or legally recognised representative body to ensure we learn from those that have gone before us. Ultimately, when we take that look—and that has been done—we see that a constitutionally enshrined voice to parliament is indeed a practical way to achieve recognition in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst I have heard community concerns about embedding the core representation-making function of the Voice in the Constitution, I'd like to reassure people that enshrining the existence of a voice in the Constitution is very different to managing or dictating the role and functions of the body. That's why I fully support the provision for parliamentary legislative powers to make laws with respect to matters relating to the Voice, including its composition, functions, powers and procedures. This provides flexibility to ensure the Voice can adapt and respond to the contemporary needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples whilst ensuring the supremacy of the parliament itself. In this way, the function of the Voice complements existing functions of the Australian democratic system and enhances the normal functioning of the government and law. Whilst it does create a separate institution that will speak to the parliament and executive, it is important to note the role it will play will be advisory in nature. It will not replace or impede the directions of either institution. Nothing about the Voice's representation will hinder our democratic processes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have worked through quite a process to come to the realisation that I support this bill, a process of deep learning and listening, and I believe most other Australians will need to work through a similar process in the months to come. In acknowledging the reasons why I support this bill, I also acknowledge that there are still genuine concerns and questions. Specifically, clause (ii) has triggered questions, as the clause states that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice may make representations to the parliament and the executive government of the Commonwealth on matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Fearmongering aside, I've been approached with honest and valid concerns from North Sydney constituents about how far this representation to the executive government will go, and I want you to know your questions are valid and I hear you. Personally, though, I am reassured by the advice that this clause would not oblige the parliament or the executive government to consult the Voice prior to enacting, changing or repealing any law, making a decision or taking any other action. Rather, the Voice will play an advisory role only. It is in this context I'd argue that the earlier such potentially important advice can be offered to any parliament or government on any day, the better. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Voice will not change or take away any right, power or privilege of anyone who is not Indigenous. Rather, the clear goal for the Voice will be to influence government on what is best for First Nations communities, resulting in better laws and policies, better targeted investment and, ultimately, better outcomes for First Nations people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a member of the 47th Parliament, I will make my best endeavours to facilitate open conversations in North Sydney in the lead-up to the referendum to ensure every person is equipped to make their own informed vote. Ultimately, I welcome this bill and the consequential constitutional alterations. The future I think it will enable excites me, and it is a future I think my children want, but ultimately each of us will have to make our own decision on the day our vote is cast. I just hope that in my role as the member for North Sydney I can ensure that as many people as possible cast their vote that day from a place of optimism and courage, seeking to leave this place better than we found it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to finish tonight with the closing statement from the Uluru Statement from the Heart itself:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 1967 we were counted, in 2017 we seek to be heard. We leave base camp and start our trek across this vast country. We invite you to walk with us in a movement of the Australian people for a better future.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say, then, in 2023 together we can achieve this better future. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="181810" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:39</span>):  I know there are a lot of people who feel like they need more information about what we're talking about here today. But, in fact, there is a lot of information, and some of it's quite dense, so what I want to try to cover off in the time that I have is some of the key issues that I know are top of mind for people, both supporters and those who are still not sure. The legislation that we're talking about today, Constitution Alteration (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice) 2023, has to be passed so that we can hold the referendum to amend the Constitution in order to recognise the First Peoples of Australia by establishing an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Voice. That's the big picture stuff. Once this bill is passed by an absolute majority of the House of Representatives and an absolute majority of the Senate, a referendum will be held in the second half of the year, sometime, we're expecting, between October and December.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are really two key things that the referendum is going to seek to do. It's going to enshrine Aboriginal and Torres Strait peoples in the Constitution. First, it's about just recognising that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples were here when colonial settlers arrived. They were here with their 65,000 years of history, with a continuous connection to the lands on which we now reside. It's recognition. I have to say, I've found very few people who are opposed to that. The majority of people nod and say, 'Well, that's just obvious, isn't it?' The second part is about listening to the voices of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples when it comes to the laws and policies that affect them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The listening part is really what I want to focus on. Now, we know that listening to communities leads to better laws and policies. In my community within the Blue Mountains World Heritage area, we know that the policies that affect us are much more effective when we're listened to about our local knowledge and understanding of the precious lands that we occupy. So this is about listening to communities and making a practical difference on the ground in areas that are so profound, like health, education and housing. That is what the Voice will help deliver. Why are we so confident about that? Because all of us know that we get a better result when we partner with the community affected, and this is about partnering with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spent 20 years of my working life going to and from the Northern Territory. I was there for about a week every month, working with very well-meaning organisations and government departments. Over the course of that 20 years, I saw the same ideas and programs being put up. There might be five or 10 years between them, but they came back. They often didn't achieve what they were designed to achieve, because they weren't done in partnership with communities, but we got some good results where they were done in partnership with communities. I can think of a few of them. The Indigenous Ranger Program is a really key and transformative program. There are the many Aboriginal community controlled health organisations. They're making a genuine difference in their communities. Justice reinvestment is another one that changes the way we deal with people who are operating outside the law. These all demonstrate strong and improved outcomes when communities are involved in decision-making. And this referendum is the best chance we have to address the injustices of the past and create change that will lead to a better future, and, quite frankly, lead to us in this parliament making better decisions about where taxpayer dollars go to improve the lives of some of the most vulnerable populations.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll get to the actual referendum question. Australians are going to be asked a really simple question. The question that will be on the ballot paper is:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to address the furphy—it's the kindest way to describe it—that there's no detail and that this process has been rushed. It's important because we understand that in people's really busy everyday lives constitutional reform is not always the highest priority. I certainly know that when I was busy raising kids and running a business the last thing I would have had time to really think about was the detail of constitutional reform. But it is hard to find a pre-referendum process since Federation, since we first wrote the Constitution, that can really compare to the lengthy process we've gone through to get to this point.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a statement of fact that no referendum has been preceded by more debate, more engagement by parliamentarians, legal experts and community members than this one. There was, for instance, an expert panel on the recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Constitution established in 2010—13 years ago. It conducted community consultation and produced a report in 2012. Then there was the 2015 report of the Joint Select Parliamentary Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. Now I'm surprised that one didn't become everybody's bedtime reading. Even back then we were going into the detail of it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was the First Nations constitutional dialogues conducted by the Referendum Council in 2016 and 2017 to discuss options for constitutional reform led by Aboriginal peoples. And then there was the First Nations National Constitutional Convention at Uluru, held by the Referendum Council in 2017, to ratify the decision-making of the constitutional dialogues. That led to the final report of the Referendum Council in June 2017 endorsing the Uluru Statement from the Heart and calling for Voice, Treaty and Truth. So that's what got us to what people are familiar with, the Uluru Statement from the Heart. Since then, there's been the 2018 report of the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition Relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. That recommended the government initiate the process of co-design of the Voice with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Then there was the co-design interim report in 2020 and the final report in 2021, and the Prime Minister announced a draft constitutional amendment in July last year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since then, there has been robust scrutiny and testing from various groups around it. Most recently there was another parliamentary inquiry process. We've also had the Joint Select Committee on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice Referendum complete the most recent inquiry on 12 May this year. It made a single recommendation: that this bill be passed without amendment. And that is exactly what this parliament should do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's an overview of how we find ourselves here. On top of that there's the Solicitor-General's advice, which was released. The opinion draws a line under some very wrong and baseless arguments that have been put forward, including by the Leader of the Opposition, I'm afraid. The Solicitor-General's opinion is consistent with the overwhelming consensus of opinion from constitutional experts. The view is that not only is this amendment compatible with Australia's system of representative and responsible government but it would enhance that system. The Solicitor-General also confirms that it will be a matter for the parliament and not the High Court to determine when and how the executive government consults the Voice and considers the advice of the Voice. All of that should give Australians confidence that constitutional recognition has been well thought through and that it will work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to touch on the design principles that underpin the Voice, because this is where people haven't necessarily had the opportunity to go through the detail. The detail exists. It's just a matter of finding the time to work your way through it. The design principles that have been co-designed include that the Voice will make representations to the parliament and the executive government on matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, which means that they can make representations proactively, that they can respond to requests and that the Voice will have its own resources to allow it to research, develop and make representations. The second design principle is that the Voice will be chosen by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people based on the wishes of local communities. This means that members will be selected by their communities, not appointed by the government. Members would serve on the Voice for a fixed period of time so as to ensure regular accountability to their communities. And to ensure cultural legitimacy, the way that members of the Voice are chosen would suit the wishes of the local communities and would be determined through the post-referendum process. I know that people have asked questions about that, including members of my local Dharug, Gundungura and Darkinyung communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Design principle 3 is to ensure that the Voice is representative of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, that it is gender balanced and that it includes youth. The fourth principle is that the Voice will be empowering, community led, inclusive, respectful and culturally informed. Principle No. 5, a really key one, is that the Voice will be accountable and transparent. Design principle 6 is that it will work alongside existing organisations and traditional structures so it respects the work of existing organisations. Design principle 7 is that it will not deliver programs. It will make representations about improving programs, but it will not be the deliverer of those programs. The final principle is that it will not have veto power. Under each of those is a whole lot more detail, and I'm really happy to share that with people in my community who may have more questions and now can go: 'Okay, I get that. I want to go a layer deeper.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These sorts of principles were talked about in Springwood at the hub recently, when I brought together around 700 people. Filmmaker and incredible activist Rachel Perkins shared with us her insights, her thoughts and her journey from the Uluru Statement from the Heart through to her support for the referendum. I thank Rachel. We had 400 people in the room and another 300 online who were participating by entering questions and by giving responses. It wasn't an exhaustive discussion. It was an initial discussion. There were a range of views canvassed, including from First Nations people. It was really important to start that conversation in the community on that scale. It can be a daunting prospect, but I encourage all members of parliament to do it. I think we will have many more of those discussions in coming months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we think about why this is happening now, our First Nations caucus members—particularly Senator Pat Dodson, the Minister for Indigenous Australians; and Senator Malarndirri McCarthy; but every one of our First Nations caucus members—have worked very hard on this. The message really is that it's time. I will leave with the words of Daniel Morrison, Chief Executive Officer of the Wungening Aboriginal Corporation, who talked about why this matters for future generations. He said: 'The time is now. It's 2023. We deserve change, if not for us for the children who won't have the opportunity to vote in this year's referendum.'</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="297660" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr RYAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:54</span>):  At least 50,000 years ago, the many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander nations became the first sovereign nations of this Australian continent and its surrounds. Those nations had their own laws and customs, and their sovereignty was never ceded or extinguished. More than 20 years ago all sides of politics in Australia accepted that this rich fundamental history of Australia should be told and that, central to a long overdue reconciliation process, our First Nations should be recognised in the Constitution. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The demand for recognition became the proposal for a constitutionally enshrined voice to parliament, which would empower our Indigenous people to take their rightful place in what is and always has been their own country. Six years ago, in the Uluru Statement from the Heart, our First Nations people asked us to create for them a voice to parliament. The Uluru Statement from the Heart is a beautiful document. It's an invitation and a gift to our nation from our First Peoples. Most Australians have not yet read it, but I suspect that most people in my community of Kooyong have. I know that not only because the people of Kooyong are, on average, 10 per cent smarter and 20 per cent more attractive than the people of any other electorate in Australia, I know that because my team has managed to deliver the Uluru Statement from the Heart directly to their doors. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In these recent weeks of May 2023, a steady stream of volunteers has come to my electoral office to pick up boxes and boxes of postcard sized statements from the heart. They have now letterboxed them to every home in the electorate. In providing every Kooyong household with a copy of the Statement from the Heart, we have delivered a statement of intent. As Kooyong's Independent I would not stand on the sidelines or, like some in this chamber have, actively campaign against recognising our First Nations Australians in our Constitution. Instead, I will be out in the community with hundreds of volunteers, bringing our community with us as we work towards a historic yes vote in the forthcoming referendum. Just this month alone, more than 140 of our wonderful volunteers have delivered more than 72,000 copies of the Uluru Statement from the Heart. And for that I thank them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The goodwill from our community is palpable. On receiving her Statement from the Heart in her letterbox, Joanna from Canterbury called our office. She said that she so appreciated receiving the postcard from her local member that she wanted to become involved as a volunteer immediately. Others, like Eric from Hawthorn, John from Canterbury and Mandy from Hawthorn have also emailed to say that they appreciated the gesture. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was really pleased to read in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Age</span> last week that the Yes 23 campaign is readying its 7,000-strong volunteer army to flood Australia ahead of the referendum. Dean Parkin, the director of Yes 23, said that there have been over 100 Voice related events nationally in the last week alone, in sporting clubs, religious institutions, workplaces, community halls, offices and schools. This is a decentralised distributed network campaign. Discussions are happening at kitchen tables and around water coolers around the country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have every confidence that this plan will work. I know that because I've seen it before—in the campaign that brought me here. To those saying that they don't believe that these grassroot volunteer armies will make a difference in the Voice referendum, let me say this: most felt that volunteer armies wouldn't succeed in Wentworth, Mackellar, North Sydney, Warringah, Curtin and Goldstein. They especially didn't think that the extraordinary groundswell of 2,000 volunteers in my electorate of Kooyong would create the change in our community that it created in 2022. But it did. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With this speech, I wish to inform the House of what on-the-ground voice campaigning looks like in my electorate right now and why it gives me great confidence that the public will accept the gift from our First Nations Australians that we can walk with them in accordance with the Uluru Statement from the Heart. The delivery of 72,000 statements from the heart in Kooyong followed on from our initial Voice information night with Thomas Mayo and Marcus Stuart held in the Hawthorn town hall earlier this year. That community town hall had just under 1,000 attendees. I'm proud to have informed the House that we are not stopping there; we are only just getting started.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the next few months, our incredible volunteers will knock on every door in Kooyong. They will give every household in Kooyong an opportunity to discuss the forthcoming referendum. Our dedicated team of volunteers numbers more than 100 already, and it is a broad church. There are people doorknocking for the very first time alongside doorknocking professionals. There are card-carrying Liberals, alongside lifelong Labor Party members and Greens voters. We have an amazing Youth4Voice team, with 25 young people in Kooyong, who have written presentations to be given in schools across the electorate to help spread the word. This is not a political movement; this is a grassroots social movement motivated by a desire to support one of the most important questions faced by this country in recent years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, and perhaps most excitingly, corflutes are back. During the federal election, the people of Kooyong expressed their desire for change by placing a corflute at the front of their homes. What started with a few dozen signs here and there around the electorate turned into a flood of support. By election day, 3,000 homes in Kooyong had a corflute out the front. I'm proud and excited to tell the people of Kooyong that we have now designed Yes 23 corflutes and will soon be offering them to our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The point of all of this is to say: do not underestimate—ever—the power of community. If there is any lesson to be learned from the 2022 federal election, it is that, when an Australian community stands up and demands a change, it can surprise everyone. Kooyong is but one community in a big country, a country now full of communities that have learned the power of collaborative local democracy. I know that many of my fellow Independents represent communities that are also standing up for their values, inclusiveness, collaboration and positivity ahead of the Voice referendum. Almost exactly one year after the community campaign for Kooyong ended, the community campaign to win the Voice referendum is just getting started. It will not be won in this House; it will be won in the houses and homes and around the kitchen tables of kind-hearted Australians across this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will be voting in favour of the Constitution Alteration (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice) Bill 2023 because my community overwhelmingly supports recognising First Nations Australians in the Constitution and giving them a voice to parliament. First Nations Australians have been calling for a greater say in the development of Australian public policy for more than a century. With a successful referendum, Australia will finally listen to those calls. This will be a source of pride for the Australian nation. It will be a unifying moment for us all. It is past time for all of us, as the Uluru statement says, to walk together with Indigenous Australians. As we walk together with those born of early settlers and with our more recent immigrants, it is time for us to give our First Nations Australians a voice, and it's time for us to listen to that voice. So I commend this very important and very significant bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McEwen</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:04</span>):  When it comes to the upcoming debate on the much anticipated national referendum, there are two important words in this debate, 'consultation' and 'recognition'. They're two simple words that mean a lot to people who have been here for many, many thousands of years. The enshrining of a First Nations voice in the Constitution is built on these simple but essential principles. The question that the Australian public will be considering later this year is based on these principles—simple yet very important. It is time we as a nation listen to the voices that spoke at Uluru.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to start by acknowledging the traditional owners and custodians of the country of our great McEwen electorate, the people of the Kulin nation—the Dja Dja Wurrung, the Taungurung, the Wurundjeri and the Wurundjeri Woiwurrung peoples—and the traditional owners of the land on which we meet and are standing here today, the Ngunnawal and Ngambri peoples. May I say it's a shame we don't open our parliament acknowledging in First Nations language, something I think we should be doing. We should all continue to acknowledge their continuing connection to land, skies and community. We pay our respects to peoples, cultures and elders past, present and emerging, both in this place and within the vibrant communities that we all represent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to support this bill, the Constitution Alteration (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice) 2023, as we as a nation push towards recognition of our First Nations people, the beginning of healing after generations of advocacy and hard work from our First Nations leaders. This referendum is responding to the honest question put forward by the Statement from the Heart. It was a call to finally recognise the people who for over 65,000 years of continuous culture have walked this land. I'm proud to stand with a government that is ready to listen and answer that call.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill enables the beginning of this important process to get constitutional recognition that First Nations people have been fighting for. Our Constitution is the framework that binds and upholds the very laws of our country. The time of federation was momentous. It was the birth of modern Australia as we now know it, laying the foundations to build the country that we all love. When I think of the birth of modern Australia, Tom Roberts's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Big Picture</span> painting is one of the first that comes to mind—a gathering of people from across the country, excited for a new beginning and to build a great country that would be 'renowned of all the lands'. But that room didn't welcome everyone. The custodians of the land, the First Nations people who walked this country, were locked out. Back then, they were not even considered citizens. As Thomas Mayor puts it in his book <span style="font-style:italic;">Finding </span><span style="font-style:italic;">the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Heart </span><span style="font-style:italic;">of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Nation</span>, the Indigenous populations were 'voiceless', believed to be 'dying out' in the eyes of our founding fathers. While First Nations people have since gained the right to citizenship, in the 1967 referendum—it is still baffling to think they had to go through that—what we haven't rectified is providing a voice to address the matters that affect Indigenous communities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look at the artwork that surrounds the Uluru Statement from the Heart, Thomas Mayor likens those signatures to the southern sky. The lead artist, Rene Kulitja, wrote on it 'Uluru-ku Tjukurpa', which roughly translates to 'the traditional stories of Uluru'. It tells of laws, religion and the moral system through the illustrated story lines around the statement. This piece of art, as Rene emphasises, represents everyone. We're all citizens under the southern sky, and this Statement from the Heart outlines the importance of constitutional recognition and enshrining and protecting a voice. For our nation to continue progressing forward, we need to embrace our history, recognise the culture that has been the building blocks of Australia's foundation and make sure we uphold the simple but important principles of consultation and recognition. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we step out to be a leader in this ever more globalised world, having this constitutional recognition and Voice that amplifies Indigenous voices will create a unique identity for our nation on a global stage. It will bring about better and more targeted policy that will have a positive impact on the Indigenous communities that it represents. It means that policy will have further reaching effects, going further to tackle the ever-elusive goals of closing the gap. It's not about a bunch of politicians around a table. It's about the coming together of voices from Indigenous communities and tackling issues that these communities see every day. They will have better ideas of how to solve the issues affecting their communities, and we must amplify these voices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where does the Voice to Parliament come from? We've heard tonight: 2010 this process was started. In 2017 a momentous convention of leaders and elders took place, in the shadow of Uluru, of 250 delegates that were nominated from their communities in 13 regional dialogues. This was the largest gathering of Indigenous representatives ever held, and what came out of it was a path of hope and empowerment, a way forward to build from the wrongs of the past for a brighter future, to make Australia more united and reinforce the pillars of our democracy. To talk about the Statement from the Heart we must acknowledge some of the dissent that was present during the convention, where a handful of delegates walked out of there, being vocal in their displeasure at the proceedings. It would be amiss to believe all Indigenous people are homogenous in their beliefs and values, and we can see that now in the present-day debate. But the vast majority stayed because for them it was important to have this done, and what came next was a moving and incredibly unified front for the way forward—the decision of enshrining a voice into the Constitution, along with constitutional recognition, being the first step.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This comes off the back of years and years of campaigning and advocacy by Indigenous leaders. This is what the Statement from the Heart put forward to the nation of Australia. June Oscar, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice commissioner, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Uluru Statement carves out a path for change and we need that to be embraced by our fellow Australians and our political leaders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The heart gave Australia a pathway forward where delegates invited Australians to walk with them. Most Australians recognise we need to start walking along this pathway to make our nation fairer and a better place. As Thomas Mayor said, what was a people's movement soon became a constitutional movement. After the heart we have a way forward, and that is what the Albanese Labor government is following. We are listening to the needs expressed, making sure we are consulting with a large majority of Indigenous leaders and elders and respecting their wisdom. This government accepts wholeheartedly the recommendation, which is why we are pushing to hold this referendum, because we are listening and acting on what these communities are saying.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what does the Voice actually entail? As we get closer, in the dialogue around the Voice we are experiencing an ever-growing campaign of misinformation and divisive rhetoric from those who seek power through confusion and division, so let's bring it back to the very bare basics. The Voice is about ensuring Indigenous communities from all around Australia are represented at federal level when it comes to policymaking on Indigenous issues. As Aunty Pat Anderson said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is about getting grassroots voices amplified and feeding into Canberra, representing the views and voices of their communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For instance, the Voice will provide recommendations to government on its Closing the Gap report, aiding and strengthening the decisions made that affect Indigenous health, livelihoods, wellbeing and justice. It does not have overreaching power to change government policy; it is there to provide advice, help create the best policy and get the best outcomes. Further, the Voice is an advisory body, not a third chamber to parliament. The people who peddle these lines are using scaremongering tactics against the goodwill of Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we as a nation will be given at the end of this year is a simple question: a proposed law to alter the Constitution and recognise the First Peoples of Australia by establishing an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice, creating a new chapter in recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Islander people in the Constitution. These are things that are actually important to the people who they affect. This is a simple change that won't have a noticeable impact on average non-Indigenous Australians. I will say this to people loudly: what changes for you the day after this referendum is successful? When you wake up in the morning, you put milk on your cornflakes, you hop in your car to drive to work or you whip down to watch your team play football, what change does it make? What impact does it have on you as a non-Indigenous Australian? The answer is simply nothing. But it does give you an opportunity to stand up and be part of a nation that actually acknowledges what happened in the past and is doing its bit to rectify problems that have happened and fix the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what does it mean to our Indigenous Australians? It means a hell of a lot: consultation, recognition and a chance for them to be able to build a better future and have their voice heard by us and for us to go out and listen to them. I was listening to Ken Wyatt, the former member for Hasluck, the other day, in one of his interviews, and he said: 'How often do people go out and sit in the red dirt and listen to communities? How often do people go out and do these things?' That was a man who stood by his principles, and he left the Liberal Party because of that, because of their objection to this very simple question that has been put forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What those opposite fail to understand is that the establishment of a Voice and enshrining Indigenous rights in the Constitution is not mutually exclusive with achieving the targets we need to achieve. In fact, having a First Nations Voice helping with policy goals and being in a position to hold our government accountable will only strengthen Australian governments. We know there's been a lot of talk and a lot of stuff put forward that is just factually incorrect. As Thomas Mayo puts it, we've got to protect what we can build. That's the importance of the effect this positive change will have on the lives of Indigenous Australians, and we want to make sure it has a lasting impact.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been questions about the legal consequences, with the opposition seemingly wanting to make the Australian public believe this body would dictate almost how your kids make sandwiches. We've heard the utter rubbish from the shadow Attorney-General. This is the person that those opposite want to put as the first law officer of the land, talking about the impact of parking tickets. I don't think I've heard a bigger idiotic statement in my entire life. Maybe get back behind the whiteboard, where you seem a lot brighter, because it is absolutely wrong to have this rubbish on Anzac Day, talking about the football and what it means. That is purely the No. 1 tactic of conservatives: divide, conquer and scaremonger. That's all they've got.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want to do the right thing—if you want to stand up and say: 'You know what? We can acknowledge this and we're growing up and we're mature enough to be able to have this debate, have this referendum and bring our country forward'—then you've got to vote yes. It addresses so many problems for so many years. It's a simple way for us to be able to do the right thing, but it is a powerful and strong message that we send for Indigenous Australians that we hear them and we understand them and we want to get the best outcomes we can. We've seen that the opposition are going to be sitting on the wrong side of history with this scare campaign. As I said, the Voice not going to hurt non-Indigenous Australians. It's not going to impact them. It's not going to cause problems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I'd like to direct everyone back to the Uluru Statement from the Heart—specifically the meaning behind the art surrounding the statement. Having the representation of the southern skies and the stories along the songlines of the Tjukurpa, it welcomes everyone into a better future that we can see. With the Voice, we are one step closer to finding the heart of a great nation, and we hope that the Australian people will accept the invitation and walk together for a better future.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWN" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr COULTON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parkes</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:18</span>):  I rise tonight to speak on the Constitution Alteration (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice) 2023. I come to this place tonight to speak on this with a feeling that, whichever way this referendum goes, it's not going to be good for our country. I am concerned, and I will point out the reasons why I have concerns about the proposal and I'll talk about the other side of it. But I just want to put on the record that I believe that the Parkes electorate has the second-highest percentage of Aboriginal people of any seat in this room: 16½ per cent of my constituents are Aboriginal people. There are Aboriginal people among the citizens of all the communities in my area. Many of them are in leadership in local towns. Indeed, two of my electorate staff in my office are Aboriginal people. They weren't chosen to work in my office because they were Aboriginal people; they were chosen because they were the best people for the job, and they are doing an excellent job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the last election, I believe, I was one of a few people on this side of the House that actually got a swing to them. That was largely because the communities that have high proportions of Aboriginal people supported me. I actually got a 17 per cent swing to me in Brewarrina, and in the election before I got a 34 per cent swing to me in Goodooga. I actually won the seat of the town of Wilcannia, which is the home of the Indigenous-Aboriginal Party of Australia. I'm telling you this because I wear the burden of responsibility of representing these people who have given me their support very, very dearly. For nearly 16 years I have been their voice in this parliament. One of the things that I have been finding upsetting—I'm sure many in my electorate have too—has been some the patronising contributions we have heard from the other side of the chamber from people who clearly are speaking from an intellectual or philosophical level without having an understanding of what they are talking about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since this proposal has become a definite that was going to happen, I have been meeting with community leaders right across my electorate—people like Alistair Ferguson, who heads up the Bourke Tribal Council. They were instrumental in setting up the Justice Reinvestment Program, a program that has got national attention for dealing with issues in their local community—a success driven by local leadership. If I go up the river a little to Brewarrina, six of the nine councillors on Brewarrina Shire Council are Aboriginal. The general manager of the council is an Aboriginal man, and they are doing an amazing job in that community. They are paving roads. Eighty per cent of the workforce at Brewarrina Shire Council are Aboriginal people, and they are doing an incredible job of developing that part of the world around Brewarrina, Goodooga and Gongolgon. It's the home of the fish traps, one of the oldest manmade structures on earth; it apparently predates the pyramids. Bradley Hardy does an incredible job of explaining to visitors the history of the traps and the cultural history of the people on the river there—the good and the bad as well; not glossing over history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I am finding incredibly disappointing is the speeches from people who don't know who are claiming that nothing has happened. I find that offensive to the people that I represent. I can talk you about young men and women that I met as students in schools in Moree and Brewarrina and other places who now have senior roles in state and federal government, who are practising doctors, who are high authorities in land management with the Rural Fire Service—a whole range of occupations and local leadership. Most of my shire councils have Aboriginal people on them, including someone I have a great admiration for, Vietnam veteran Vic Bartley, who is a long time councillor at Bourke. These are local leaders. To say that Aboriginal people haven't had a voice and a say in their destiny is incredibly offensive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can tell you, from speaking to my constituents, they are concerned about a voice that is selected by this parliament. They are concerned that there will be people who may have political allegiances making up the Voice. They are convinced that there will be no-one represents them and their individual circumstances that would get an opportunity to be a part of that voice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue is: who is an Aboriginal person? I suspect that's why the Voice will be selected and not voted upon. As I said, 16½ per cent of the people in my electorate identify as Aboriginal people. But they are just people. They go to work every day, they've got their kids at school, they probably do better than average in the local sporting teams. If you go to my towns and see the local footy teams, or the golf course, there is no way that people are treated by race. Now we are looking at putting into the Constitution something to identify people by race permanently. I can't possibly see the upside of doing that. By putting it in the Constitution it is there forever, I believe. Some of the older members of my community have memories of ATSIC; they certainly don't have fond memories of that time. They are concerned we will end up with a group of people that's not accountable especially to those people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I said I have concerns if this goes either way. I am concerned that if it doesn't get up—and I am definitely not voting for it, and I suspect it might not get up—that also is quite negative. I only wish the government had put some more thought into it and put up something that was acceptable to the Australian people. The idea that this could be legislated by parliament is not a strange one. I'm on the record; if you go back to my first speech, I talked about constitutional recognition for Aboriginal people. I'm certainly not opposed to that. What I am opposed to is a body that, once it is in place, is there forever. If it comes to a position where the people I represent feel they aren't being represented by that body, what is the mechanism for them to have some say and get their voices through? We've seen some of the proponents be quite aggressive and disrespectful to people with an alternative point of view in this whole process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm incredibly proud of the efforts of the people I represent. Last year there were over 70 Aboriginal students who did the HSC in Dubbo. That is an incredible result from what it was 10 years ago. We see that the REDI.E corporation are running a supermarket where the people of Wilcannia can get fresh food for the same price as they can at large centres. We've seen a young lad of 18 go to New Zealand and beat the Kiwis at the Golden Shears shearing competition—a real role model to other young people to go into the shearing industry, which is a well-respected and time-honoured tradition for young people getting a start in life. Many people I know start off shearing and move onto other things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've listened to the contributions in this House. I find that they're patronising. I find they're really not speaking on behalf of real people. I am concerned that the people I represent, that have put their faith in me for the last 15½ years, are not going to gain a benefit from this proposal. I am concerned with the way this is going.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  On Anzac Day 2023, as I've done for many years prior, I gathered with the George Town community to pay my respects at their dawn service. This year, I was struck by a wonderful speech and original poem shared by Star of the Sea student Keegan Jacobs, a recipient of a George Town RSL bursary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Keegan spoke of his great-grandfather Raymond Mudie who fought in World War II as a corporal and sergeant, facing battles in the Middle East. I wanted to share just a small extract of Keegan's speech about his late great-grandfather that he affectionately called 'Poppa'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">No matter what, the men that poppa led was his main priority, this was especially shown on their return to Australia. Whilst waiting on the ship to be allowed to disembark, one of the officers was trying to make all the men do exercises. Men who had been fighting a war for years, who were exhausted and just wanted to go home. Poppa being the inventive person that he was decided that this was not going to happen and he threw the officer overboard. This was one of the instances where he went from Sergeant to Corporal quite quickly. I like to think that if I was in that situation, I would have the courage he did to stand up for his men.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Although the war ended in 1945, the battles continued for many service men and women for the rest of their lives. Poppa had demons that he fought for the rest of his life, the memories of what he went through never left him. To his family he tried very hard to be the happy smiley man who left for the war, however, at times it was too much to bare, and he had to deal with a lot on his own.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Later in the day, I had the pleasure of addressing a small gathering of residents in Nunamara to share the story of one of their own: Jessie Simons, later Jessie Hookway. Jessie was raised on a farm in Nunamara and undertook training as a nurse at the Launceston General Hospital before heading to Singapore in September 1941 to attend to wounded soldiers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the advance of Japanese forces on Singapore, Jessie was evacuated with 65 of her nursing sisters and a large cohort of civilians on 12 February 1942. Two days later, their vessel, the SS <span style="font-style:italic;">Vyner Brooke</span> came under sustained bombing attack by the Japanese. Jessie was rescued from the water and, once on land, was taken as a prisoner of war along with 32 of her nursing sisters, eight of whom would die in internment. More than 20 of her former colleagues were massacred on 16 February in what became known as the Bangka Island massacre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For 3½ years Jessie remained a prisoner of war, returning home in late 1945. Just two days after her return, Jessie was interviewed by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Mercury</span> newspaper and said: 'There were things you couldn't imagine, and I wouldn't want you to know. It seems 1,000 years since I left Launceston.' Jessie went on to write an account of her time during the war titled 'While History Passed', and passed away in Launceston in December 2004 at the age of 93. Lest we forget.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="298840" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr REPACHOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:34</span>):  It's the end of an era for our region in the Hunter, with the closure of the Liddell Power Station. Liddell was built in 1971 and served our region and our state for well over 52 years. It provided much of New South Wales with reliable, affordable power and provided our region with well-paid, secure jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We knew this day would eventually come. The closure was first announced in 2015, and, in the period since then, Liddell had two extensions to its life. But it is still a sad time for those in the Upper Hunter who have grown so used to seeing the smokestacks of Liddell just outside of Muswellbrook. It's part of the Upper Hunter, and it's hard to imagine what it will be like driving up along the New England Highway when we'll no longer be seeing it, in just over 18 months, when demolition has been completed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout its lifetime, Liddell generated over 430,000 gigawatt hours of power. At its peak, it ran 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and generated enough output to power 750,000 average Australian family homes. The grand old lady, or old girl, as it's known in my electorate, truly was a workhorse. And the grand old lady had a good run, with only one per cent of power stations operating for more than half a century like she did.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You don't find many workplaces where people love their jobs, but people who worked at Liddell were some of the few who did say they loved where they worked and what they did. Some worked on the site for their whole working lives, and the power station gave employment to several generations of families. In its prime, Liddell employed over 700 people. When it closed, it employed 180. As the local member, I'm very proud to say that not a single one of these workers was left unemployed from this closure. Around half went across the road to the Bayswater Power Station, one-third retired and one in 10 are trying something new. There are also 20 employees staying at the site to decommission it over the next 18 months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Liddell had well and truly done its service to us, but the time had come for the aged power station to close. It had reached the end of its economic and physical life. As it aged, it became less reliable for our energy grid, more expensive to operate and more unsafe for those who worked there. This is why it was time for it to close.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Liddell was a baseload power station. Its job was to run 24 hours a day, seven days a week, making sure our state had reliable power when it was needed. But because of its age, we could not depend on Liddell to supply us with reliable power like it once did. In recent years, the station was operating under capacity. This is why there is no need to fear about our energy supply or price hikes, now that it has closed. This has also been confirmed by the Australian Energy Market Operator, who has told us that there will be no threat to supply from the closure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I know there will be some who will jump up and down, saying that Liddell should have stayed open and Labor should have stepped in and forced this to happen. But those people—mostly found sitting opposite—aren't basing their argument on logic or even economics. They're basing their arguments purely on politics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And to the people in my electorate: some will try and tell you that a 52-year-old power station which required constant maintenance and was no longer a reliable source of power generation, and was putting workers at risk, should have stayed open. But the truth is: these people don't care about what's in your best interests. They only care about scoring political points.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud that the Hunter has been a powerhouse of New South Wales for over half a century, and I will spend every day that I work in this job fighting to make sure that we continue to be the region that keeps the lights on in New South Wales for the next 50 years as well. While the closure of Liddell is the end of an era, it is also the start of a new one, filled with new opportunities and good, secure, high-paying jobs in our area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you to everyone who has worked at Liddell over the years. The Hunter and the whole of New South Wales is grateful for the important work that you did to keep us warm in the winter and cool in the summer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Goodbye, old girl. We will miss you every day. I miss you.</span>

One of these graziers was sixth-generation beef grazier Glen Kelly and his wife, Nikki. The wind factory, along with other nearby projects, including Clark Creek, Mount Hopeful and Boulder Creek, would involve extensive clearing of land, much of which has never been touched, on steep mountain ranges. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another grazier who I've known for many years and who's been battling unreliable projects is Cedric Creed and his wife, Therese. Cedric and Teresa are producers who live and work in the Callide Valley of Central Queensland in the region of Smoky Creek. They have been raising concerns about the impact of a massive solar factory—3,000 hectares—that has been approved on their boundaries, on A-grade, sloping, heavy, black erosive soil, above their food producing properties on the watershed. Unfortunately, there are many people not only in the Flynn electorate but across this country who are fighting similar battles against these unreliable energy projects. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This all directly correlates with the fact that the unreliable energy sector is producing huge infrastructure projects to meet Minister Bowen's 82 per cent unreliable energy target by 2030. This target involves 22,000 solar panels to be installed every day between now and 2030, 40 wind turbines every month between now and 2030, and a proposal to build 28,000 kilometres of high-voltage powerlines to connect these projects to the grid. These projects are now seen to be having an enormous impact, particularly in rural and regional Queensland, which I outlined in my maiden speech approximately 12 months ago. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This will cause environmental damage, and the unreliable sector does not have to comply with any current regulations in Queensland, including tree-clearing guidelines, reef legislation or environmental protocols that have been imposed on every other industry. This is simply outrageous. It's time the Queensland government implemented legislation around the unreliable energy sector that will apply governance over the unreliable sector regarding how these projects are getting built and their impact on the farming sector and, more broadly, rural and regional communities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Already we've seen the Clarke Creek wind factory, owned by Mr Andrew Forrest, come to a complete standstill, with contractors told to stop work and demobilise, and the project manager Windlab dismissed. According to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span>, Forrest's Squadron Energy will take up the management of this project, which raises many questions as to why this has happened, and will the moneys owed to the contractors be paid, and what are the reasonings surrounding this debacle? The Port of Gladstone has hundreds of wind turbine components waiting for transport, with now no confirmation of a destination. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of legislation, there is nothing to make the unreliable energy sector comply with all other environmental protocols imposed on other industries, such as agriculture and the mining and resource sector. Why is there no legislation stipulating who will clean up, rehabilitate and dispose of these projects once they reach their end of cycle? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, I held a nuclear energy forum in Gladstone with the member for Lyne, Dr David Gillespie. The event had in attendance over 70 people, with plenty of positive discussion about nuclear energy and the critical role it could play in Australia's energy market in the future. The forum discussed the misconceptions surrounding nuclear energy, small modular reactors and how nuclear energy produces zero emissions but does have significant energy output. </span>

                  <span style="font-style:italic;">
                  </span>The scientific reality is that we must firm up the energy grid when unreliable energy does not provide affordable and reliable base load power. To distribute unreliable energy, more than $1 billion will have to be spent on the 28,000 kilometres of transmission lines and the establishment of unreliable energy— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired) </span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVO" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:44</span>):  Last Friday I was delighted to welcome the Acting Prime Minister and Minister for Defence to the 150th Ipswich Show in my electorate, and he opened the show on a glorious Queensland autumn day. I was honoured to be part of the official opening with him; the Queensland Premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk; the Ipswich mayor and counsellors; and local state MPs as well. It was an historic occasion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Ipswich Show is one of the longest-running community shows in Queensland. Like many Ipswichians, I grew up going to the show as an annual event. My sincere thanks go to Ipswich Show Society president Darren Zanow and show society patron Denise Hanly and to everyone involved in making this great event possible, including the show society and the more than 400 volunteers. Many thanks. I give a big thank you to No. 35 Squadron, based at RAAF Base Amberley in my electorate, for the flyover of the C-27J Spartan. I timed the ending of my speech to make sure that the flyover got there, and I'm sure that they were more interested in the flyover than in my speech.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First held in 1873, the Ipswich Show has grown from a small country fair to one of the largest regional shows on the Queensland agricultural show calendar, attracting more than 25,000 visitors annually. About 13,000 visited on the show public holiday on Friday. A predecessor of the Ipswich Show was the Ipswich Agricultural and Horticultural Society show. That society was formed on 14 March 1866. Later on, on 28 August 1872, it became known as the Queensland Pastoral and Agricultural Society. The first show was held on 13 May 1873 at a site at Churchill, facing the Bremer River. The show was moved in 1877 to the present site on Warwick Road.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The show society is a not-for-profit organisation. The municipality of Ipswich had just turned 13 when the first show was held. The six categories in the first show were horses, cattle, sheep, pigs, agriculture and miscellaneous. On that day, prizes were given for the two best hams, the two best flitches of bacon and the two best cheeses. At the Ipswich Agricultural and Horticultural Society show in 1868, the Governor of Queensland had to turn back because there was so much rain. It sounds typical in Ipswich. He got so drenched that the <span style="font-style:italic;">Brisbane Courier</span> newspaper reported that he had to turn back to the middle of town for a change of clothes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was fantastic to see the show back bigger and better than ever, with a massive program. I held a mobile office as usual for the full three days, and we gave out over 7,000 of my red Shayne Neumann information bags. There was something for everyone, from arts and crafts to local produce, agriculture, performers, fireworks, exhibitions, competitions, rides and, most importantly, many happy, smiling faces. It was fantastic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was an honour to be able to take the Acting Prime Minister on a tour of the trade pavilion to see a cross-section of our outstanding local businesses, including Imbibis Craft Distillery, whose artisan gins and liqueurs have won several international awards. Wounded Heroes, also a great organisation in our local community, were there, and I showed the Acting Prime Minister the great work that they do and he had a good chat with them. He even found time to have a chat to River 94.9 on their outdoor broadcast. I heard nothing but positive feedback about his event and also about the show and what it achieved locally. The visitor numbers were a record this year, which is fantastic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have made a commitment of $4 million to upgrade the Ipswich Showgrounds, including $2.5 million for general upgrades and $1.5 million from the government's Disaster Ready Fund to improve amenities such as showers and toilets for use by residents during emergencies. I think that about 11 times in the last 12 years the show society have opened the Ipswich Show during natural disasters, so this is a very important commitment that we're making to the show society. This will support the broader redevelopment of Ipswich Events and Entertainment Centre, which will incorporate emergency relief to provide accommodation and care for residents during natural disasters. During last year's floods, the showgrounds provided accommodation for many, many people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the show society for what they've done and the great work they did this year. I'm looking forward to the Esk Show this weekend. The weekend before, I was at the Marburg Show and my staff and Labor Party members went to Kilcoy. These shows do a great job in the local community, connecting people and showing the best of our local region.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BROADBENT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:49</span>):  I won't muck around. I'm here to stop the jabs and the mandates, protect the kids and tell the truth—my body, my choice. Every day I engage with people who are suffering from vaccine injuries or impacted by COVID mandates. Vaccine-injured Andrew is tormented by excruciating pain 24/7. After surgery last week, he's distraught that his life is ruined. Katherine has worked for two years and is overwhelmed with depression after having her application for compensation rejected, even though two doctors agreed that her injury was caused by the vaccine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But today, I received a video message pleading for help from Dazelle, a beautiful 16-year-old girl who needs a double lung transplant due to the side effects of chemotherapy and surgery. Dazelle has been fighting cancer since she was 13. She has been through several rounds of chemotherapy, ending up on life support and dialysis, and endured a bone marrow transplant, which her body rejected. If that's not horrendous enough, now two major hospitals are refusing to do the transplant because she hasn't had any COVID-19 injections. One of the specialists even said that Dazelle is a health risk to other fully jabbed patients. At first, she was told she'd need two jabs; now she's told she needs four—three up-front and a booster in six months. But Dazelle doesn't have six months to wait. Her medical advisers need to remember they took an oath to 'do no harm', because terrible harm is exactly what they're inflicting on Dazelle and her family by demanding she is jabbed four times!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For more than two years, I've been raising the alarm regarding mandates and vaccine injuries. But I don't stand here to be adversarial—COVID has ripped our country apart, and we need to start healing as a nation. I appreciate that you might think I don't understand how hard it has been for government to make quick decisions around the pandemic whilst incorporating policies on the run. I accept their decisions were made in good faith. But now I plead with my colleagues and those in the House to also act in good faith. Do you think it's okay for Dazelle to be refused  lifesaving surgery because she hasn't been jabbed? She and her parents aren't anti-vaxxers, far from it. After her bone marrow transplant, Dazelle had to be revaccinated with all her childhood vaccinations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know I was fortunate not to be mandated to keep my job. Right from the start, like Dazelle, I was cautious and hesitant about a vaccine that had been developed so quickly. I felt strongly, and I still do, that it's 'my body, my choice'. That's what Dazelle is asking for, too. With the TGA database now showing more than 140,000 notifications of adverse events and excess deaths in Australia being 12 per cent above the baseline average, it's well past time we had an open discussion about the safety and effectiveness of these vaccines. Personally, I find it abhorrent that these provisionally approved vaccines were mandated on pregnant women and that parents were encouraged to jab their kids. At the very least, it's time to end the mandates and investigate what's going on. I say to our medical practitioners: it's time to speak up; do it for Dazelle! I know these past three years have been tough for so many medical and health practitioners. And I know many feel conflicted and wrestle with the issue of informed consent. Who can blame them with Aphra threatening to deregulate them if they deviate from the COVID script?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I implore my colleagues in the House that enough is enough! Please listen to your constituents. People are suffering unimaginable distress. I have said before that, as their elected representatives, the job of fixing this mess rests with us. It's time we remove the shackles of apathy and disconnectedness. We must end the mandates, stop the jabs and keep our kids from harm. I am personally concerned that there are so many out there crying in the wilderness that only want to be heard. And, yes, there are those whose lives have been torn to pieces by these vaccine mandates and injuries. I try to bring them the attention of the government of this day and those ministers that are responsible in these areas. I can only ask that you hear their call. These people are not a minority in our community anymore. They're real people. They have real blood just like ours. They bleed like we bleed, and they are really suffering. And there are thousands of them, as has been confirmed quite often by many of my colleagues. Thank you for the opportunity to address the House, Mr Speaker. I do appreciate it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:55</span>):  The Blue Mountains has a small but strong Tibetan refugee community, many of whom have taken the path to citizenship. It's because of the stories of struggles that they've shared with me that I became engaged in the human rights issues that Tibetans experience. Many of those who come to Australia have been arrested for their activities in Tibet within Chinese borders. They've shared with me the challenges of being afraid to communicate with families still there, the fear that any contact might generate unwanted attention on that family member. They've shared their commitment to trying to increase the freedoms that their families in Tibet experience. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I was very pleased to lead a delegation to meet with the Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharamshala in northern India last month. Arranged by the Tibet Information Office in Canberra, my all-party parliamentary group for Tibet included my co-chair, senator Janet Rice, and we were joined by the Deputy Speaker and the member for Mackellar. Our purpose was to meet with members of the Central Tibetan Administration, including leader Sikyong Penpa Tsering, ministers of his government and members of that democratically elected government. I know the Deputy Speaker was very pleased to meet her counterpart, also a woman. The Dalai Lama's decision to create a democracy that serves the interests of all Tibetans outside Tibet was an ambitious one, but it was terrific to see what fresh eyes do in developing a democracy from scratch.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had the opportunity to discuss geopolitics with the Dalai Lama for nearly an hour, and that was a real privilege. We met with younger members of civil society. We visited a school, a nunnery, a medical centre and an aged-care home, where Tibetan compassion and hope run strong. We saw their efforts to maintain Tibetan culture while in exile and heard their concerns for fellow Tibetans in China, particularly around the removal of about a million Tibetan children from families into boarding schools and the widespread DNA data gathering. Both those issues were raised. As the UN experts say, there are practices taking place that run contrary to the human right to education, the right to linguistic and cultural freedom, and the right to freedom of religion or belief. There was also deep concern expressed, including by the Dalai Lama, about the environmental damage being done to the fragile Third Pole. Tibet has the largest alpine ecosystem in the world, with 14 of the highest mountain peaks providing fresh water to more than 10 river systems. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What was very clear is that the words of support from the Australian government are very much appreciated by Tibetans living in exile. There was also appreciation for our visit, although I think we were the grateful ones to gain insight into the lives that Tibetans in exile are leading. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will continue to advocate for the rights of Tibetans whose educational, religious, cultural and linguistic freedoms have been eroded. I look forward to continuing also to work with my local Tibetan community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to mention small gifts that I took from Australia, including wooden wombats, tea towels and aprons from the Ferry Artists Gallery in Wisemans Ferry and work from Tangentyere Artists in Alice Springs. They were very warmly received, including by the Dalai Lama, who held his emu tea towel up with pride. I feel very strongly it will not be used to dry the dishes. It was a very powerful and memorable experience. I want to thank Karma Singey, the representative of the Dalai Lama for Australia and the region, and Dr Zoe Bedford, the executive officer for the Australia Tibet Council, for joining us on the visit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Small businesses don't operate without good connectivity, and it's vital in disasters. The Albanese government has confirmed the funding in our budgets to fix 14 mobile black spots in the electorate of Macquarie: Blaxlands Ridge; Bowen Mountain; Oakville; Maraylya; Berambing; Bilpin; St Albans; Central, Upper and Higher Macdonald; Yellow Rock; Hawkesbury Heights; and Bullaburra. Mount Tomah, which was treated with disdain by the previous government, is also being constructed. It's more than $6 million. They should have been done following the 2019-20 fires or, even further back, following the 2013 fires. This makes a difference to business and gives them an even playing field.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:35</span>):  Townsville, Cairns, Mount Isa and Mareeba have the highest crime rates ever recorded probably in Australian history. Over three cars are stolen every day in Cairns. Every family in Townsville will, statistically, have their car stolen over the next 13 years. When these juvenile offenders are incarcerated in what is euphemistically called a detention centre, this detention costs the taxpayers over $850,000 a year. And what do the magistrates achieve? They keep sending an amateur criminal to incarceration and getting back a professional criminal—a person who is now totally alienated and who sees himself as an enemy of society</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the old days, before the whitefellas came, we blackfellas had bujeka, and it was a common word. Percy Neal told me it was used by the tribes, a common word in Eastern Australia, a common word in Central Australia and a common word in Western Australia. It means banishment. My generation remembers, at the top of the hit parade, the song 'My Boomerang Won't Come Back'. To quote from that song:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">They banished him</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">From the tribes then</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">And sent him on his way</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">He had a backless boomerang</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">So here he could not stay</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In other words: banishment, which was the law in the old days in Australia. If you played up in the old days, they didn't need prisons. You'd be sent out into the bush to live by yourself until you were prepared to behave like a civilised human being, and then—and only then—you'd be allowed back into the camp. So, what we are saying is to bring back bujeka: 'Goodbye; ta-ta; I'll see you in a year's time.' You will now be 1,000 kilometres away from Cairns or 1,000 kilometres away Mount Eliza. What we're saying is to bring back bujeka.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It must be said that in many situations the punishment does not fit the crime. Many young kids are just guilty by association. They're little kids who've been thrown in a steel cage like an animal when they really haven't done anything wrong; their older brother tells them that they are to hop in the car he's just stolen or he'll get a bashing. In the past, these kids would have been given a good kick up the backside and a clip under the ears by a local copper, and that would have been the end of it. But now they are costing us close to $1 million a year and of course are permanently alienated from society. Relocation sentencing, as it's come to be called—being sent to some remote location, literally 1,000 kilometres away—offers the people of Cairns, Mount Isa, Ingham, Mareeba and Townsville assurance that these offenders will not be in their towns any longer; they will be 1,000 kilometres away, and they won't be costing you $850,000 a year. By the way, I was corrected the other night on television: it was $1 million. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

His name is Petr Levkovskiy. Like many Australians today, Pete came to Perth as a migrant, for a better life and opportunity for his family, settling in Bull Creek, like I did when I first came to Perth. He was smart, kind and giving. He read a lot about everything; he was very curious. He was a family person and liked to spend a lot of time with his family, his kids and his friends, playing board games, bushwalking and going on picnics. Pete studied hard. He worked hard to get a good-paying job and raise a loving family here in Australia with his wife, Anna. Pete, like all of us present here today, loved this wonderful thing called life. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the morning of Sunday May 22, Petr did what every good Samaritan does when a cry for help happens. A desperate kid was crying for help, and he went to help. Sadly, he did not come home that day. One year has passed. It is one year since a terrible and senseless act that has profoundly impacted Anna and her family. Crime is a concern that transcends age, gender, race and religion. We as a community must look out for one another like Pete did. We must continue to care for our neighbour. Everyone deserves to come home safely. I know that, now that we are in government, we can do more to make sure this never happens again.</span>

Petr was a great example of honesty and responsibility. He was willing to help people and willing to make every day brighter and better for everyone. Thank you, Pete. You will always be in our hearts.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McPherson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:41</span>):  Last week I joined with state and council colleagues to host a community meeting on stage 4 of the Gold Coast Light Rail. It was standing room only, with over 600 people attending and many more unable to enter the building. It was a real reflection of community concern, and I've not seen a public meeting quite like this in all my years as a member of parliament. Speaker after speaker raised very legitimate concerns about the impact of the proposed route including the logistics of lane closures; a reduction in local parking and access to side streets; the environmental impacts of cutting through Burleigh Hill, going over two estuaries and affecting koala habitat, as well as the destruction of culturally significant Indigenous sites; and the safety aspects of emergency vehicles accessing along the Pacific Highway. Residents are also deeply concerned that this project, effectively, provides a green light for overdevelopment of the southern Gold Coast and will forever change the nature of this unique part of Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The community sentiment was very clear. We cannot risk damaging local businesses, creating long-term traffic issues and harming our environment with the current proposal. It is not fit for purpose. In the lead-up to the meeting, I conducted a survey of the affected suburbs, and I've had over 1,600 responses so far. Eighty-six per cent of local residents said they are concerned about the negative impacts of light rail on our southern Gold Coast environment and lifestyle, and a huge 85 per cent want the extension of heavy rail from Varsity Lakes to Coolangatta to be made a priority. This is the public transport infrastructure that our community wants and needs, which is why I am today delivering 125 letters signed by local residents at that meeting to the federal Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Catherine King, asking that the extension of the heavy rail be made the priority in her 90-day review of national infrastructure projects.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's essential that all levels of government listen to the community and deliver infrastructure that will actually benefit residents and make our regions stronger. The depth of feeling at last week's meeting clearly shows that residents believe that light rail stage 4 will do the opposite. It's a matter of public record that I have deep concerns about stage 4 and that I've been calling for the extension of the heavy rail line as a priority. I want to assure my constituents that I will keep fighting for them on these vitally important issues.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:44</span>):  I rise to acknowledge the Albanese Labor government's $91.7 million commitment to continue funding the Reconnect program that assists young people experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness. On the Central Coast, up to 8½ thousand people are homeless or marginally housed in the region. Programs like Reconnect provide support and assistance to people in these circumstances. Reconnect service provider Uniting has been offering this program to the people on the Central Coast. Through its service, people aged 16 to 25 years can access specialised homelessness support as well as assistance with finances, legal issues, family matters, health and mental health, employment, and education and training. The Central Coast Uniting team are highly knowledgeable experts in finding the most appropriate short and long-term housing and support solutions to those young people accessing or in need of this service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government understands that funding homelessness prevention services that address contributing factors that lead to homelessness, like family breakdown, help to strengthen our communities and make them more sustainable. The federal government is also committed to building more social and affordable housing, particularly for vulnerable Australians. Our Housing Australia Future Fund will achieve this by investing billions to build 30,000 new social and affordable housing properties over a five-year period. The fund will assist women and children impacted by family and domestic violence with up to 4,000 homes.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently had the privilege of visiting the Uniting speciality centre in Wyong to meet with the phenomenal team who run this service on the Central Coast. I saw and heard about the outstanding work that takes place in and from this centre, and spoke with each of the team members that make it all happen. I would like to place on <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> my appreciation and thanks to those remarkable individuals: Jade Brown, Charlie Chubb, Jodi Madigan, Kristy Warren, Brandon Pinchbeck and Breanna Ferguson. I thank the minister for their work, and for ensuring that youth homelessness and support services like Reconnect receive substantial funding to continue their vital and life-saving work. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:46</span>):  At the 2021 state election, tens of thousands of Western Australians in the Peel region put their trust in Mark McGowan and Labor. But now I hear nothing but buyer's remorse. People ask why the Peel Health Campus has not been fixed. People ask why many state government projects are delayed, over budget and underdone. Frankly, people are tired of the endless excuses and blame shifting. Last week in the Western Australia parliament, the member for Murray-Wellington delivered an extraordinary display of buck passing, blame shifting and, frankly, language unbecoming of a parliamentarian.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's fact check some of her claims. Fact check 1: The member for Murray-Wellington said only Labor committed a record $160 million to transform our hospital into a truly regional hospital. In reality, WA Labor's record of health delivery in Western Australia and Canning is a disaster. The Peel Health Campus has been named one of the worst hospitals in the nation for emergency waiting times. In 2022 ambulance ramping hours skyrocketed to reach their worst on record. They may have promised an upgrade but this weekend the Western Australian health minister admitted these urgent upgrades will not start for another year, and this was after the hospital was evacuated on Saturday because of black mould in the system—more excuses and more delays.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fact check 2: Lakelands Station—the member for Murray-Wellington was also happy to claim credit for the opening of the Lakelands train station. I first heard about this project when doorknocking in north Mandurah in 2016. People were angry that they had bought a home there on the promise of a train station. We started a local campaign to deliver the station—community forums, phone calls, mail outs, leaflet dropping, mobile offices. With the support of the local council, we secured $2 million for the business case and $10 million for the initial build. It was the coalition government that delivered another $52 million for the Lakelands train station, taking our contribution to $64 million of the $80 million project. For years, Mandurah MP David Templeman had sat across from Premier Mark McGowan at the cabinet table without delivering a single dollar in funding for the train station yet here we are two weeks away from opening, only because we campaigned and committed the money. Labor did not want it, and the people of Lakelands and I fought for it and together we have delivered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fact check 3: the Mandurah Estuary Bridge. The member for Murray-Wellington claimed that the WA Labor government was funding $110 million to duplicate the Mandurah Estuary Bridge. This is false. The previous federal coalition government agreed to invest $55 million into the bridge duplication in 2021 after a Liberal-led community campaign. WA Labor only committed to match the funding for the project during the 2021 state election campaign.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A final one might be the biggest delusion of Mrs Clarke—that is, fact check No. 4: Pinjarra Heavy Haulage Deviation. This is a project that will get 600 trucks out of the town of Pinjarra every day and onto a new road. We committed $200 million; she is claiming $250 million. She is just plain wrong. We want competence and WA Labor are not delivering it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:49</span>):  Not one of the members in this parliament who are blocking the social housing package that we have put forward is currently waiting on a social housing waitlist—not one of them. Not one of the members from the opposition, the One Nation party, the Clive Palmer party or the Greens is currently waiting on a social housing waitlist. Yet, that group of members is currently blocking the federal government from constructing social housing homes. It's the first time in a decade that a federal government has constructed social housing. You would think that, if you're sitting on the same side of the chamber as Pauline Hanson, as the guy from the Clive Palmer party and as Peter Dutton's crew, maybe that would be an indication that you're on the wrong side of this debate. But that's exactly what the Greens are doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It gives me no joy. On this side of the House, after watching the previous government refuse to spend a single cent on social housing over their decade in office, we know how hard it is not only to win government but to get money on the table for social housing. We finally have the opportunity to build 30,000 homes, as a starting point for the federal government: homes for First Nations Australians, homes for veterans, and homes for the thousands of women and children who are currently experiencing domestic and family violence and are being kicked out of shelters because there just aren't enough beds. These people are waiting. Games can be played with a whole range of issues, and politics will be played on a whole range of issues in this place. That's fine; that's part of this place's peaks and troughs. But don't stand in the way of shelter, of social housing homes.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the start, not one member of that group of parties—of One Nation, of Clive Palmer's party, of the coalition or of the Greens—who is currently standing in the way of social housing is waiting for a home. None of them are. I think that in this place we have to be honest and we have to be accountable. There are times when we agree with each other and there are times when we don't. But I know that if I was sitting on the same side of the chamber as Pauline Hanson, Peter Dutton and Clive Palmer on a debate about social housing, maybe I'd look around, because on the other side of the chamber you have the Labor Party, the teals and the Independents. You have the Labor Party, the teals and the Independents all coming together because we've negotiated in good faith to try and come up with an outcome. From the Prime Minister to the housing minister, everyone has tried to get an outcome on this bill. But there is a group of people standing in the way, and they should get out of the way so we can build more social housing homes.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="291387" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAMILTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:52</span>):  Last Tuesday there was an extraordinary coming together of the greater Queensland GPS community, as Mr David Scott Bell was laid to rest at a very moving ceremony at Brisbane Boys College. Since the late eighties, Mr Bell has been a much-loved teacher and colleague at no less than five GPS schools: BBC, Churchie, and the Ipswich, Toowoomba and Brisbane grammar schools. Across an impressive range of roles, he's remembered and admired most for his willingness to help struggling kids find their own love of the English language. That's what he focused on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He had a fine career. But, as fine a career as he had, it was as a rugby coach that he truly excelled. Mr Bell was one of those men who believed wholeheartedly in the all-round benefits of sport. He sought not just to make his charges better players but to make them gentlemen, a high ambition that was sometimes a tough challenge. He coached club as well as school teams: GPS 1st XV, Queensland U16s, Queensland Schools 1 and 2, Queensland U19 and Australian Schools. Unbelievably, his teams won five national championships. His combination with his great mate Mr Ian Jones across 197 of those matches resulted in a winning rate of 67 per cent. To put that into context, Wayne Bennett is sitting on 62 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In every aspect of the game there were life lessons to be learnt. In every weekend fixture there was an opportunity to better prepare yourself for the challenges life would one day throw at you. In the pursuit of victory, he hoped you might even come across the greater prizes of happiness and self-respect. In this way, he shared the views of the founder of the modern Olympics, Pierre de Coubertin, that rugby was an enabler of 'social and moral strength'. I think Mr Bell would have liked that comparison, as there was something from a bygone era about him. He had a famously dry wit and a rapier sense of humour, which is captured in the memoirs of two former Wallabies captains, John Eales and Rocky Elsom.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was my coach and someone I looked up to tremendously. He played a huge role in my life. I'm lucky enough to say he briefly coached my son too. I'm very grateful for the interactions we had, and today I remember him with some fondness. In an age when we bemoan the lack of male teachers in our schools and the underperformance of boys in academic results, Mr Bell's ability to connect with young men, to give them belief and courage both on the field and in the classroom—and, yes, sometimes even on the floor of parliament—makes him all the more missed. Of course, he'll be missed by none more so than his amazing daughters, Charlie, Molly and Rosie, and my thoughts are with them and with his family at this time. May he rest in peace.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr CHARLTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:55</span>):  I rise today to acknowledge International Mother Language Day. International Mother Language Day is celebrated every year on 21 February. It was formally declared by UNESCO in 1999 and has been celebrated since 2000. International Mother Language Day brings together communities from across the world and celebrates the important role languages play in building cultural identities while highlighting the need to protect and preserve languages. I note the contributions of the Bengali language movement and community in championing this cause and for the success of International Mother Language Day. I also acknowledge the contributions of Sydney's Bengali diaspora in leading the promotion of International Mother Language Day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is a distinctly multicultural community with over 400 languages spoken at home. We have an unparalleled opportunity to take a leading role in the protection and promotion of mother languages. Already we've made progress towards this goal with the construction of the first International Mother Language Day monument in Ashfield on 19 February 2006. I know this was a collaborative project between the local member for Grayndler, now Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, and Sydney's strong Bengali community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate of Parramatta is similarly a beacon of multicultural success within the greater Sydney metropolitan area, where 61 per cent of people speak another language at home compared to the national average of just 22 per cent. With such a strong multilingual community, Parramatta has the potential to become a local leader in the promotion and protection of mother languages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the work of Prabir Maitra, a Westmead local and branch member who's been a champion for multicultural Australians as a former City of Parramatta councillor and Labor branch secretary. Prabir is the son of Ranesh Maitra, a veteran of the Bengali language movement, the same movement that would later help establish International Mother Language Day. So, on 21 February 2024, on International Mother Language Day, I encourage everyone in Australia to come together and celebrate our multicultural community.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAWKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mitchell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:58</span>):  It's a pleasure to rise and speak about the 22nd annual Cancer Council Hills Relay for Life, which was held this weekend, Saturday 20 and Sunday 21 May, in my electorate of Mitchell at the Castle Hill Showground. It's a privilege for me to have attended the last 15 years with a team, along with thousands of others from my community. I'm told by the Cancer Council that the Hills Relay for Life is probably the largest in Australia and that the relay that has raised the most money, which is a very significant achievement from the Mitchell community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously Relays for Life are to recognise and celebrate local cancer survivors, patients, their carers and to honour and remember everyone who's been lost to cancer and to raise that vital money for research and funds in the ongoing progress that we are all making as humans against an insidious disease that takes so many. This year it was a privilege to have about a hundred people on my team and to raise a couple of thousand dollars, but it was more important to see that over the last 22 years we've now reached over $5 million just from this one relay. This year we reached $300,000 as a community for the Cancer Council. It's a great privilege to represent such a generous and charitable community, and this relay, being one of the largest—if not the largest—in Australia, is a great source of pride to me and a great community for me to be involved in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Hills has some of the highest voluntary rates of anywhere in the country. We still have that great community spirit. Even post COVID, people are getting back into community volunteering. I note the state government are promoting volunteering again, and I support their endeavours to get on board and get people out volunteering and back to that sense of community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This relay doesn't come together overnight. I really want to congratulate the Hills relay committee. They prepare almost all year round, with nine months of intense effort at the Castle Hill Showground. I want to congratulate and thank the Hills Relay For Life volunteer committee. They are all volunteers. There's the chair, Lisa Carruthers, Michelle Patterson, Jaime Berglin, David Hand, Lynne Pike, Ruth Didsbury, Alison Harper, Katie Didsbury, Bryan Mullan, Feona Hennes, Jenny Glover, Karen Cunningham, Renae Dean, Michelle Byrne, Denise Daynes, Bev Jordan, Angela Pike and honorary committee members Jacqueline and Victoria Lee. They show fantastic dedication. That's a large team I just mentioned, but there are even more volunteers behind them. To raise $5 million in the last 15 years is such an important effort. We heard from the researchers and the people who benefit from that money on the work that they do and the progress that they've made in fighting this insidious disease.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say big thankyou to everyone, the 2,000 participants on the weekend. Millions of dollars were raised. We have great community spirit and a really great institution. I look forward to participating in this for many, many years to come to make sure we are raising that vital money and supporting all the victims and survivors of this insidious disease and their carers.</span>

That gives me a chance today to give a shout-out to all of our amazing local volunteers in the Bendigo electorate. This year I would like to particularly focus on people who volunteer in our community and health sector. Our community houses throughout the electorate would not survive if it weren't for the amazing work of volunteers in Kyneton, Castlemaine, Heathcote, Maldon and Greater Bendigo. We have a number of community and neighbourhood houses and centres that do great work. There are all the community meals that they prepare, the volunteer reading group that they have and the work that they do to help elderly people with their gardening. There are also community houses that help with organising and coordinating events like our recent Pride events and festival. Our community lunches in particular would not happen without the great work of the volunteers who help out.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In our health sector, we have a number of volunteers who've come back, even after COVID, to be volunteering in our health setting. I'd like to give a special shout-out to all the volunteers at Bendigo Community Health Services that assist in the emergency department. It's been tough in the emergency department, particularly as we are coming into flu and COVID season. Every night, there are long waits in the emergency department of Bendigo health, and I know how hard the volunteers work to help keep people calm and to help them navigate their way through a complex system. Whilst we work to rebuild Medicare, we know that their job will continue to be challenging. I say 'job' because it does feel like a job sometimes for these volunteers. They turn up and do their shift. The only thing that really distinguishes them from the others in an emergency department is they wear a red T-shirt and they are not paid for their dedication and quality of care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My final shout-out is to the amazing people that work in emergency relief. A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to meet and catch up with the new volunteers at Sunshine Bendigo. They are one of the emergency relief organisations that supply emergency support for families with young children—everything that they may need on the birth of a child or if they've had to move quickly and have children under five. This includes pots, prams and warm clothing for the winter. You name it and they are there to support people with it. They recently had to move premises. It took a village to move them, but they did it. I give a special shout-out to the people at Bendigo Foodshare, who tell me that there's never been a greater demand for emergency relief and food support services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Central Victoria would stop if it weren't for the great work of our volunteers. I'd like to give them a shout-out and encourage others to think about volunteering to help their community, their friends and their neighbourhood.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor have never met a tax they didn't like. In fact, in 12 months the Albanese government has riddled two budgets full of new taxes and broken promises. The last election we warned Australians—we warned them—that when Labor run out of money, what they do? They come after yours. That's what they do. Their attempts to raid your superannuation is just one of the many ways that the Labor government are trying to take more of what you earn.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Labor announced their superannuation policy, they intentionally misled Australians, claiming it would affect only older and wealthy Australians. They tried to turn the policy into class warfare, as they do time and time again, pitting young Australians against older Australians—always dividing, never uniting. They're asserting that those older Australians, many of whom have spent their entire working lives paying taxes to support this country, can spare a little more because they are so well off. What they fail to tell you, potentially, is that while they were raiding the super of older Australians they also had their grubby hands in the super of 2,000,000 young Aussies under the age of 25. Modelling released to the coalition under freedom of information on the government's controversial superannuation tax confirmed the changes will apply to young Australians earning average wages over their lifetimes. I hope young Australians are listening to this.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to Treasury's own analysis, a 20-year-old, who earns an average wage throughout their life will have a superannuation balance higher than $3,000,000 in their early 60s, seeing the tax on their super double by the time they retire. That means a 20-year-old today—and I've got them in my household—earning an average salary will be caught up in the net of Labor's doubling of superannuation taxes.</span>

                  </a>  For the first time, young Australians will face higher taxes on their super than the generation before them. This tax hike will affect young Australians under 25, including tradies, executive assistants, teachers, nurses, police officers, accountants, journalists, public servants, physios and many other professions. And what for? So Labor can pay for their pet projects, rollout more dodgy programs like school halls and pink batts. Not only did Labor lie to you about not touching your super but they also lied about it affecting only older and wealthy Australians. They're going after older and wealthy Australians—I hope they're listening to this today too—and then they tried to hide it from you. For a bunch that claim to be all about transparency, they spin lies and they break promises like a dodgy second-hand car dealer—or worse, I don't mind second-hand cars.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Young Australians are doing it as tough as everyone else right now—even more so in some areas. As the shadow minister for youth, I speak with young people regularly—all the time. What I hear time and again is that many are struggling, financially and also mentally. Rents continue to rise, and with house prices soaring, many of them fear they will never live the Australian dream of owning their own home, and they should be able to realise that dream. Suicide continues to be the leading cause of death for young Australians. Last year, 402 young Australians lost their lives to suicide—402 too many. Mental health is a huge issue, and with many young Australians trying to overcome challenges of the past few years with COVID, it's becoming harder and harder to access mental health services and, for many, with the cost of living rising, it's simply unaffordable. Yet this most recent budget delivered nothing for young Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The latest ABS data shows youth unemployment is climbing back up again and it's now sitting at 8.2 per cent. It's a shame. A lesson for those young Australians who may not remember a time under a Labor government, is that when Labor run out of money, they come up to yours. When Labor claimed they wouldn't touch your super, they lied. Young Australians deserve to know why they always pay more under Labor governments.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:09</span>):  I'm happy to rise to respond to the motion put forward by the member for Moncrieff. I'm not sure if the member for Moncrieff plays any cricket, but it reminds me of those days when the kid at school, the bowler, would go right back to the boundary, come running in and then slip right at the crease and deliver a complete dud—one of those John Howard dud deliveries. This is the sort of fear campaign that I've come to expect from the member for Dickson. It's a shame to see that the member for Moncrieff has swallowed the Kool-Aid.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sean Kelly in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> actually reminded everyone of the member for Dickson's long history of dog whistling and running scare campaigns. He is a one-trick pony. Remember that time he said Melburnians were 'scared to go to restaurants' because of African gangs? The people of Aston didn't forget that the other week. There was the time the member for Dickson called refugees 'illiterate and innumerate' but then in the same breath said that they would take people's jobs. Obviously, fear doesn't have to be logical. Of course, remember the member for Dickson walking out on the Apology to the Stolen Generations and his recent declaration to campaign hard for a 'no' vote for an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice. So, with this long history of dog whistling, including this motion, we need to go to the core of such campaigns, and that's misinformation, because this motion doesn't waste any time getting into its misinformation groove.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not sure who the member for Moncrieff chats to, but I'm not sure there are many 20-year-olds earning the average wage. For those that don't know, the average wage for a 20-year-old is about $24,000 a year, a far cry from the $90,000 used in the motion to make the maths work. I don't know how many part-time or casual jobs there are out there, being filled by 20-year-olds, that pay those sorts of wages. But, if the member does know of any, I'm sure that there are plenty of 20-year-olds who would like to know.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also talking about a motion highlighting a proposition that is more fanciful than real, and one which in any case wouldn't really affect anyone until 2068, 45 years away. To put that in context for the member for Hinkler, 1978 is 45 years ago. But, hey, scare campaign sent dog whistling aren't about facts and reality. The member for Moncrieff possibly got a call or two from some of the 17 people in Australia who have over $100 million in their super accounts who are actually concerned about these changes. She would have been nodding along on the phone as they complained about Labor picking on them and treating them unfairly, all the while thinking to herself, 'These poor battlers,' those poor 17 people with over $100 million in their super accounts. 'What can I do to help them?' Thus the birth of this stupid motion as part of the LNP's ongoing dog-whistling scare campaign. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the member for Moncrieff doesn't mention in the motion any of these people that she's trying to help out. They are those that shall not be named.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr PERRETT:</span>
                  </a>  No opposition members, no doubt, will mention the notorious 17, but I'll leave it open to the member for Hinkler. Why? Because 99.5 per cent of Australians don't have over $3 million of super and therefore won't relate to the story of people with super balances of $100 million plus. The member for Moncrieff would have thought, 'How can I get people to relate?' So the figures were fudged that pushed the time frames right out to almost half a century into the future to get some scary numbers at the end. I'm surprised she didn't talk about people who were a year old now and how their super balances will increase. How disingenuous. This is from the same mob who rail against the evils of compulsory super any chance they get—an industry that Labor created that now has around $3 trillion invested around the world and in Australian infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In reality, the changes to superannuation tax breaks for earnings on balances of above $3 million is the right thing to do. Labor was focused on saving for retirement when we invented superannuation, not rorting the tax system. The $3 million threshold strikes that right balance between incentives to save for retirement and strengthening the super system by making it sustainable into the future. Labor built the superannuation system, and we'll always protect it and work to make it stronger for all Australians—not just those poor battlers who have balances of over $100 million in their super accounts!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like night turns to day, the LNP will blow their dog whistles. I even see the Leader of the Opposition blow the dog trumpet every now and then. I know that the leader does it better than anyone, but I hate to see him infecting his frontbench—that same fear campaign, that misinformation campaign. That's not what the people of Australia care about. Obviously, if we extrapolate long enough into the future, all Australians will have super balances of over $3 million, but that is a hundred years away. Ridiculous.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PITT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:14</span>):  It's always great to follow the member for Moreton. He gives me so much material. For the member for Moreton's benefit, does he really think people would put money into superannuation if it weren't for tax incentives? Without tax incentives, no-one would do it. Nobody would put additional money into an account that gets locked away for decades unless there was an advantage for them. They simply would not do it. We are all for people looking after their own money and making their own decisions with the money that they own and that they earn.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Madam Deputy Speaker Chesters, say it isn't so. We heard promises from now prime minister Anthony Albanese during the election campaign that there would be no changes to superannuation. There would be no changes to franking credits, no changes to unrealised gains, no changes to capital gains and no changes to negative gearing. Now, we know how much of that has turned out to be untrue. Firstly, Australians made a decision on who they voted for at the last election based on those commitments. Secondly, they made decisions on their own finances based on the rules of the day that were in place at the time, as they should. For many of them—those who have self-managed super funds, for example—who have actually borrowed money and bought hard assets, changes to unrealised gains will absolutely destroy those investments, because they will not be able to pay the tax on them. They simply won't have the money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll declare an interest: I have a self-managed super fund. Right now it doesn't own any hard assets. I don't have any of those types of assets, but I have had them in the past, and changes like these simply would have meant that I would've been forced to sell that property, because I could not pay what is coming as a tax bill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen the now Prime Minister of this country backflip on many of these issues, particularly those around superannuation changes and franking credits. Yes, I acknowledge what the member for Moreton has said: for most Australians that's a lot of money. It is, but people made those decisions based on the rules that were in place. Is the idea that they have to unravel the investments that they used to pay for their retirement because this government cannot control their spending in just one budget? Let's face it, the Labor Party increased spending in the budget in May by $185 billion over the forwards. That is $185 billion that has to be paid for. It'll be paid for by taxation from hardworking Australians right around the country, whether it's middle Australia, whether it's those who are on much better wages and incomes or whether it's the ones in between. You only have to look at my own electorate. The loss of the low-income tax offset meant that 51,000 of the people that I represent lost up to $1,500 this year in tax returns that they desperately need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at what is actually happening. The point made by the member for Moncrieff is exactly right. On 5 May 2023 Simon Benson, that well-known senior political reporter from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span>, wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">More than two million young Australians earning an average wage throughout their working life could be hit with a future super tax under the government's plans …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Guess what? You'll get there faster with an inflation rate of seven per cent. That's where it is right now. If the inflation window is not within target, they will reach these numbers much more quickly than before. That is the analysis of Treasury modelling. So what has been put forward by the member for Moreton, for example, is your own modelling from your own department, in terms of the federal Labor government. Based on the advice from Treasurer Chalmers's office, a 20-year-old earning an average wage throughout their career would have a super balance of more than $3 million by the time they reached their early 60s.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I am 53 and I can tell you, Madame Deputy Speaker Chesters, that in my 20s I made a decision around a particular super fund, which had a couple of grand in it, for which, at the time, I could get a thousand bucks because I'd moved jobs. I changed and I went to someone else and they said, 'If you sign this piece of paper, you'll get this, but it'll lock this other bit up.' I've got to tell you that, at the time, that was a lot of money. I made that decision, and consequently I now have a small amount locked away in a fund here with ComSuper—or whatever the arrangement may well be—that I can't get. I can't transfer it to my other accounts and I can't move it because I made a decision in my 20s which impacts me now. So, for all of those workers out there in that age group, this will impact you. You will get there. It will absolutely get there. It will impact you directly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at what happens with this money. We've now seen reports around Incolink in Victoria. CFMMEU chief John Setka is looking to expand the Incolink empire, and guess why? It is because they gave $20.5 million in the last financial year to the CFMMEU and they're looking to expand that empire across the country. It's wrong. This is why so much money being tied up in industry super funds is incredibly dangerous for the country. They simply don't look after it in the interests of members, only in the interests of unions.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="MT4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BROADBENT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:19</span>):  It is a pleasure to follow the member for Hinkler in his description of where this legislation leads us. I make only one very strong point on this issue. Yes, it will affect young people. Yes, it will affect lots of occupations and people who have invested under these laws. The point that I would like to make is that, if government decides in the process to change the rules, you then have to address the fact that you have changed the rules and give the person you had the agreement with an option to opt out of the contract that you put in place with them in good faith.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What am I talking about? I'm saying that, because of the rules set before the Australian people over a number of governments, not just this one, where they have made changes, governments have to go out of their way to say, 'We've have made this change, we believe, for the long-term benefit of the nation's people as a whole.' However, if you are directly affected by these changes, government must allow people to opt out of the contract. In business, if you and I make an agreement about a loan fund in which you agree to loan me a certain amount of money on these terms, and it's contracted, we both enter into that loan agreement in good faith. If, halfway through, one or the other says, 'Look, I don't believe you're paying me enough for the money that I lent you, because times have changed, and I'd like to change the contract,' it is an obligation and it is law that the person challenging the current situation must offer the other the right to opt out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, whilst I agree that government can make any change they like on any issue they like—this government can legislate for anything, and they are doing so; whether you agree with it or you don't agree with it, they have the numbers on the floor of the House and they've only got to get through the Senate as well to make changes to any current rules before the Australian people. I'm just saying that, if you do that, there is an obligation on government to go back to the people who are directly affected by the change to say to them, 'If you don't like the arrangements that we have now changed on our watch, we are going to give you the opportunity to withdraw all of your super money out of super and take it to a place of your choice for your investment.' The Liberals and Nationals believe that people should be in control of their own money. They were in control of their own money when they entered into a fair agreement with the government of the day—and that's what they did. And now these changes will directly affect a number of people with super balances over a certain amount.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can accept that and I can accept absolutely that the government elected by the people of Australia has the right to make a change. My argument is this: if you then enter into a changed situation, you must go back to the people that you have made the change for and say to them: 'Alright, we've made the change. If you don't want to continue to invest in this product that we're offering you, we offer you the opportunity to opt out.' Then you say, 'But that would have millions of dollars taken out of super and put into other investment arrangements.' Yes, it would, but it's an obligation of government to say: 'We've changed the rules. Nobody else changed the rules. We changed the rules by legislation in the last budget, and this is what we're doing with super. This is where we want to go.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I was criticised at the time—mostly by my own party—for being seen to support the government in their super changes. That's not exactly what I said, but it was taken that way at the time. I'm saying two things. One is that, during the election campaign, the now Prime Minister said, as opposition leader, 'I won't make any changes.' The current Treasurer, Mr Chalmers, said exactly the same thing: 'We do not envisage making any changes.' In the last budget, they did. That's my first point. My second point is: if you then make that change, be fair on the Australian people who are affected by that change and say, 'Because we've made the change, you can now withdraw the whole of your super and put it in another investment of your choice.' That is fair and reasonable.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="I8M" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr CHARLTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:25</span>):  This motion is yet another example of the 'no-alition' paying politics while we get on with the business of governing for Australia's future. The government has been completely upfront about these proposed changes. We're making a modest adjustment to superannuation tax breaks for those with balances over $3 million. That means 99.5 per cent of Australians with super accounts will keep on receiving the same generous tax breaks that are currently in place. That means that just 0.5 per cent of people with balances above $3 million will be impacted by this measure. Let's be clear about that. They will still receive tax breaks, just less generous tax breaks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is completely wrong for those opposite to claim that these modest super changes will unfairly impact younger Australians. The simple scenario raised today illustrates that a young person earning $90,000 right now and increasing their earnings throughout their life would be very unlikely to exceed a balance of $3 million during their working life. So the $3 million threshold strikes a balance, and it strikes the right balance between the incentive to save for retirement and protecting the future of superannuation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to super, the Liberals have no ground to stand on. Let's not forget the fact that their proposed changes to super in 2017 would have affected twice as many Australians with a super account. On top of that, this is the same group of people who allowed more than $30 billion to be drained out of Australian superannuation accounts during the pandemic. Most of that money was taken out by young Australians. In most cases people took out their entire superannuation balance, and in many cases those people remained employed or on JobKeeper. It was reckless policy on the run that did great damage to the superannuation system. It also did great damage to those individuals affected by that same policy. It didn't reduce their vulnerability, and it didn't reduce their hardship. It moved that hardship from one point in their life to another point in their life—that point being when they retire and find that they have, in some cases, up to $60,000 less in their superannuation accounts than they would otherwise have had. The policy was vandalism of Australia's superannuation system, and it will have a pernicious effect on many Australians who will now be retiring with much less in their superannuation accounts than they otherwise would. That's the damage that those opposite inflicted on Australia's superannuation system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This modest measure strengthens our superannuation system and strengthens the government's budget. Let's not forget that this government inherited $1 trillion of debt, so it is quite ironic that we have on that side of the House a political party that now wants not only to maintain that trillion dollars of debt but also exacerbate that debt by maintaining tax breaks for extremely wealthy people with superannuation balances well above what is needed to provide for a comfortable retirement, which is the purpose of superannuation. In fact, these are people who, as a result of their super balances, are getting very generous tax breaks that are not available to most Australians who don't have that same balance in their superannuation. We've been very clear about why these changes are needed with the challenges facing the economy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today marks one year since the election of the Albanese Labor government. It is one year since we inherited a trillion dollars of debt resulting from reckless coalition spending. That trillion dollars of debt included rorts and colour coded spreadsheets and programs like JobKeeper, which massively oversubsidised businesses and workers who remained employed, with that JobKeeper money going in its billions to businesses that had no reduction in their profits. Now it falls to us to fix the budget, and this type of measure is exactly the type of measure you would want to be fixing the budget with: a measure that is tailored, a measure that is targeted, a measure that doesn't affect the vast majority of Australians who are currently doing it tough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's this type of measure that is a hallmark of the disciplined economic management of the Albanese Labor government—economic management that has enabled this government to provide a surplus in its first full budget, a surplus that all Australians should be very proud of.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hawke</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:30</span>):  Listening to the contributions of those opposite to this debate on superannuation tax, it is clear that the Liberal Party is clutching at straws, frantically scrambling to maintain a misplaced sense of economic superiority. After inheriting $1 trillion of Liberal debt as well as growing spending pressures in defence, health, aged care and the NDIS, the Albanese Labor government has been up-front about the economic challenges we face. Unlike the Liberals opposite, we are taking a responsible approach to these challenges. We aren't trying to rort our way to re-election and we aren't ignoring the need to secure our nation's economic future. Labor's economic plan is about repair, restraint and targeted relief, after almost a decade of economic mismanagement at the hands of the Liberal Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This change to superannuation tax breaks is a small part of that. Despite the agitation from those opposite, the adjustment being made to superannuation tax breaks is very modest, only affecting earnings on balances above $3 million,  a figure that represents just half of one per cent of Australians—the top half of one per cent of Australians. It is also entirely in line with existing norms not to index the threshold. We don't index the tax-free threshold, the personal tax thresholds or the corporate tax thresholds. Instead, the parliament sets a threshold, and the parliament decides to change it in line with community expectations from time to time. This is a modest change to superannuation tax breaks, to be implemented in line with existing taxation practice after the next election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet somehow those opposite have decided that this is the silver bullet to their political woes. They gamble that this is the point that demonstrates that Australians should put their economic faith in the people who gave us $1 trillion of Liberal debt rather than in the government that delivered the first surplus in 15 years. Those opposite are suffering from an identity crisis. For years they have tried to fool Australians into believing that they are somehow superior economic managers, repeatedly assuring the public that only they could get the budget back in black. Now, we may not have the mugs to prove it, but the Albanese Labor government has returned the budget to surplus after just 12 months in office. So, I understand why the Liberals opposite are clutching at straws like this. But unfortunately they just don't get it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Treasury projects that only the top 10 per cent of earners retiring in 2052 will have a superannuation balance of $3 million or more upon retirement, demonstrating that the $3 million threshold strikes the right balance between providing incentives to save for retirement and strengthening the super system by making it more sustainable over time. However, if they had it their way—the mob that gave us $1 trillion worth of Liberal debt—we'd be borrowing even more money to subsidise people who already have millions of dollars in their super accounts so they could continue to enjoy the privileged economic conditions they find themselves in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition have no integrity or principle to stand on, when you think back to their changes in 2017. On introduction, the coalition's change was estimated to impact about one per cent of people who had a superannuation account in 2017-18. That is twice the proportion of those affected by this very modest adjustment. Treasury projects that at least the top 30 per cent of earners retiring in 2052 will have paid additional tax contributions in their working life under the threshold legislated by the coalition—three times the proportion affected by our change. For all of the bluster coming from those opposite, it is absolutely clear—crystal clear—that they just do not know how to effectively manage the superannuation system, let alone the economy that their egos are so invested in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span style="font-style:italic;">
                  </span>Labor built the superannuation system, a superannuation system that serves working people and provides for comfort and dignity in retirement. Only a Labor government can be trusted to protect this system and make it stronger. This budget and the changes that are contained within it are focused on making life letter and more secure for Australians, for working Australians, while those opposite will continue to dither as they try to protect the privileged interests of the top half. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Twelve months in government and they are absolutely dripping in hubris, but the Australian public know this lot. What did the Prime Minister say prior to the election, on 2 May 2022? He said, 'We have said we have no intention to make any super changes.' Then again on 31 January 2022, the now Prime Minister said, 'We have not planned for any changes in superannuation.' The Treasurer said on 27 March 2022, 'Look, we said about superannuation that we would maintain the system. Australians shouldn't expect major changes to superannuation if the government changes hands,' yet here we are.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise in support of the motion of the member for Moncrieff, who is doing an excellent job in advocating for young people and educators as the shadow minister for youth and early education. Those opposite talk about $1 trillion worth of debt. Clearly, every single time they raise this issue, they are, of course, misleading the House. They talk about $1 trillion worth of coalition debt but, just over the last 12 months, those opposite added $185 billion and around about $250 billion prior to that, when they were in government, to the current debt. You don't hear those members opposite talking about it but almost $400 billion worth of debt has come from them. Interestingly, though, they never talk about it. But in any event, it's not a trillion dollars. I know they are not particularly good at maths but it's a very, very great shame that they continue on about this.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I hosted the shadow Treasurer in Fisher for a series of events with local community and business leaders. We did a community forum. At the community forum, Trent from Birtinya submitted a question about the impact of Labor's budget on young people. He shared his own experience of paying off his HECS debt. Despite Trent having paid $7,000, because of Labor's mismanaged inflation, he has only paid $1,000 off that HECS debt in real terms. The HECS and FEE-HELP systems have allowed Australians from all walks of life to access tertiary and vocational education with an equal footing, and that is really important because trades matter in this country. We should be encouraging more young people into trades, not simply pushing every young person into a tertiary education. We are seeing the fruits of that today. You try and pick up the phone and call a plumber, pick up the phone and call an electrician or a carpenter. These trades are absolutely in such significant shortage. That is because, under Julia Gillard, they changed they changed the tertiary education system, which pushed all young people into the idea, 'If you don't have a tertiary education then you're nobody.' That is very, very unfortunate because what we are now living with in this country is a great shortage in trades. Trades matter. If you get a trade, chances are you'll actually do better in life. You will work for yourself. You will earn more money than those at universities, where those opposite like to indoctrinate young people.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms FERNANDO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:40</span>):  It has been a year since the Albanese Labor government was voted into power by hardworking Australians, and what a fantastic year it has been. Despite inheriting $1 trillion of debt accrued as a result of a decade of the coalition's mismanagement, the government has got on with fixing our nation. It has been honest and upfront about the challenges we as a nation and as an economy face. This is a stark departure from the landmark 'cover-up upon cover-up' style that characterised the coalition government. Besides the $1 trillion of Liberal debt, these challenges include global economic pressures and growing spending on defence, health, aged care and the NDIS. This government's ability to deliver a surplus for the 2022-2023 financial year, for the first time in 15 years, in spite of these challenges demonstrates its commitment to delivering a better future for every single Australian.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we are starting off in a good position, thanks to the leadership of the Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, Treasurer Jim Chalmers and Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services Stephen Jones, our work on fixing the debt we inherited and restoring sound economic management does not end there. A part of this includes modest adjustments to superannuation tax rates for earnings on balances above $3 million. This adjustment will not come into effect until after the next election. This change will not affect 99.5 per cent of Australians with super accounts, who will instead continue to receive the same generous tax breaks. The 0.5 per cent of Australians with super accounts above $3 million that are affected by this change will continue to receive tax breaks, although slightly less than before.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this point doesn't seem to be understood by those opposite, which is not surprising considering the coalition was a government for the few and not for the many. The coalition continue to be working in the interests of 0.5 per cent of Australians, among the wealthiest in this country, and are not concerned about the welfare of the 99.5 per cent. What the opposition is asking is for a break from standard practice of non-indexing thresholds. We do not index the tax-free threshold. We do not index the personal tax threshold. We do not index the corporate tax threshold. It is a custom for parliament to fix the threshold and respond to community expectations by changing it from time to time. This is what the parliament of Australia, the country's peak representative body is for: to give effect to contemporary community expectations in the present and in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I joined the Australian Labor Party because, among other things, Labor built the superannuation system. It was the Keating Labor government that introduced the compulsory employer contribution scheme, and successive Labor governments have strengthened the system, despite continued attacks by those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A $3 million threshold strikes the right balance between incentives to save for retirement and strengthening the superannuation system by making it more sustainable over time. The Treasury projects that only the top 10 per cent of earners retiring in 2052 will have a superannuation balance of $3 million or more upon retirement. The opposition have no integrity or principle to stand on when we remember the changes they introduced in 2017. On their introduction, the coalition's changes were estimated to impact about one per cent of people with a superannuation account in 2017 and 2018. The Treasury projects that at least the top 30 per cent of earners retiring in 2052 will have paid additional contributions tax, in their working life, that is under the threshold legislated by the coalition. Yes, that's right—thrice the amount of Australians affected by our change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Australians are doing it tough, this government's principal priority is targeted cost-of-living relief through a responsible and supportive budget. On the other hand, the priority of the Liberals is bigger tax breaks for the people who already have $100 million in superannuation. Indeed, the mob that gave us a trillion dollars in debt wants Australia to borrow even more money to provide subsidies for the richest 0.5 per cent of Australians. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today marks one year and a day since the Albanese government were elected, and in that time we haven't wasted a moment. That is particularly the case when it comes to the efforts we have been putting into fixing aged care, because we know that, prior to our government being elected, despite years of warnings and calls for improvement, despite an entire royal commission, older Australians in aged care in this country were not being treated with the dignity that they should have been. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that under previous Liberal governments our aged-care system was neglected, and we saw the reality of that in our communities. So our government have put the focus back on improving aged care. We've put the focus on making sure that older Australians, hardworking Australians who have helped build this country, know that, when they get to the age where they need to be looked after in our aged-care system, they can rely on that system to provide the care and support that they need now and into the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My community has told me time and time again how important the aged-care system is to them. We all know someone who has needed to be supported by the aged-care system. We all look to a future where our parents or we are going to need to be supported by the aged-care system. At the same time, those same people in my community have told me about the neglect that they've feared, the worry and concern that they have felt, because, while they know that aged-care staff have been doing their best, those staff have been overstretched and they've have been underpaid. People know that they've been leaving their relatives in a system where they can't be sure that they will be treated how they should be treated—with dignity. No-one wants to see more of these stories. Our government has been doing everything we can to turn this around.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aged-care staff do such important work. They are largely women, working in a very important area for very little pay. But staff tell me how much they love what they do. They tell me how they enjoy getting to know residents and helping them with the day-to-day of their lives. It is hard work and it's long hours. It's work that they've been thanked for, but it's not work that they're being paid for as they should be paid. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I am so proud and pleased that our budget earlier this month is making history. Our government is delivering a 15 per cent pay rise to aged-care workers right across the country. This is the biggest ever pay rise for aged-care workers. There are 56,700 award aged-care workers in my state of Victoria alone who are expected to benefit from this. This historic pay rise means that a registered nurse on a level 2.3 award wage will be paid $196 more a week. That's more than $10,000 extra a year. An assistant in nursing on a level 3 award wage will be paid $145 more a week. That's more than $7,100 extra a year. A head chef or a cook on a level 4 aged-care award will be paid $141 more a week. That's more than $7,300 extra a year. These are just a few examples, but they are so important. These are the people who keep our aged-care system running, and now they are going to be paid as they should be. I am so proud of this reform our government is making.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is just one part of what we have done to improve aged care in the year since the election. In the very first week this parliament sat after the election, our government introduced two important bills. The first enabled major improvements to aged care: to put nurses back into nursing homes; to ensure carers have more time to care; to improve transparency, integrity and accountability in the sector; and to cap the fees paid for home care. All of these are sensible, overdue changes to help improve the quality of aged care right across the sector. Since the election our government has directly addressed 37 recommendations from the aged-care royal commission. We are not going to let this rest. We know how important it is that aged care is there to support us all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My friend the Minister for Health and Aged Care has been very clear that the work doesn't stop here—we are bedding in these reforms and we are also working to address more of the recommendations from the royal commission. We are boosting the number of aged-care workers, helping people to recruit the staff they need, training more personal care workers, and much more. There is a lot of work to do; you can't turn around one decade of neglect just like that. But our government knows how important aged care is, and we will continue to do the work to make sure it is there into the future.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HAINES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:51</span>):  I thank the member for Jagajaga for this very important motion. The royal commission has shone a light on how, over time, we have undervalued our older people and, in turn, the system that cares for them. It spoke about how we owe our parents, our grandparents, our partners, our friends and our neighbours a safe, kind and quality care—care that I know is possible. At times in my career I had the privilege of working in aged care and I have witnessed firsthand the dedication, professionalism and compassion of the staff who care for our elderly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission exposed the systemic failures of our aged-care system. Daily, I hear how these failures result in frustrating and disempowering experiences of aged care. I meet aged-care providers who are trying their hardest in difficult circumstances. I sit down with health and aged-care staff and talk about the burnout that they're experiencing. Recent aged-care measures, including under the budget, are a step in the right direction. Our aged-care workers are at the heart of the system, but across Indi aged-care facilities tell me how incredibly hard it is to attract the much-needed workforce to keep their doors open. They're forced to employ nurses from external agencies at higher costs because they can't attract their own local workforce to fill the shift. Those costs include accommodation in a tight market on top of wages. A 15-per-cent wage increase for aged-care workers is long overdue and a true acknowledgement of their value. Aged-care facilities tell me they hope this wage rise will increase and attract a stronger local workforce to ease some of the financial pressures they're facing. Adrian Johnstone, CEO of the St Catherines aged-care provider in Wangaratta, says this wage rise will reward staff with the pay increase they deserve. Like me, he hopes that this wage increase will spur on more people to take up a fulfilling career in aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2021-22 financial year, 74 per cent of aged-care homes in regional Australia were operating at a loss. This is a startling figure. We feel this close to home. In the last few months, three aged-care facilities in my electorate of Indi have sounded the alarm on the extent of their financial losses. One is experiencing losses of $100,000 every month. In rural and regional Australia, when facilities go under, the consequences are felt right across the community. It's about losing a major employer and a skilled workforce. When a facility closes, I hear heartbreaking stories of husbands or wives having to drive for an hour or more to visit their loved one, when once they could just pop down the road. Likewise, lifetime friends can no longer just pop over.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the budget, the indexation for the Australian National Aged Care Classification price will increase by 17 per cent, and this means Commonwealth support given to facilities per bed per day will increase. The government say they are confident this increase will see a real reduction in the huge financial losses that aged-care facilities are experiencing right now, such as those I have described in my electorate, and I'll be watching very closely to see whether this is the case, because one thing's for sure: we can't continue to lose local aged-care providers at the rate we're experiencing now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As our population ages we must also support people to age at home when they want to. While the government is trumpeting the 9,500 extra home-care packages in the budget, the problem we're now seeing isn't about getting approved for a package; it's about finding a provider to deliver the services they're eligible for. One of my constituents—let's call her Mary—was approved under My Aged Care for help under the Commonwealth Home Support Program for gardening and for cleaning her windows and gutters. After this approval, Mary started calling the local providers listed on the My Aged Care website to see who could offer her this support. Unfortunately, Mary cannot even get on their waiting lists, as they've closed their books. Providers say there are simply not enough workers to offer the services people are entitled to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Benalla in my electorate is yet another example. The private providers are at capacity and clients are left for long periods without services. There are last-minute cancellations, the changing of workers and very little continuity of care. I met with the age-friendly Benalla U3A and Benalla Rural City Council about this crisis and I've written to the Interim Inspector-General of Aged Care asking that they do something to get this back on track. I'll be approaching the minister about this as well. This program must address the frustrating inadequacies that my office constantly hears about. It must ensure the support of quality care and the appropriate support that we owe our elderly people.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PHILLIPS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:56</span>):  I am very pleased to second this important private members' motion, put forward by the wonderful member for Jagajaga, because aged care is a massively important issue in my electorate of Gilmore. Just as we said before the 2022 election we would be, here we are 12 months later, having directly addressed 37 recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety since coming to office. That is huge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For years, aged-care workers knew what the problems were and pleaded for the former government to fix the issues, but the government weren't listening, and they certainly weren't acting. I had local aged-care workers from across Gilmore tell me clearly that aged-care workers were leaving aged care because the pay of aged-care workers just didn't stack up. There just weren't enough aged-care workers in nursing homes and there just wasn't the necessary time to care for residents—people's loved ones. It wasn't because aged-care workers didn't care; it was because they did care. Today I say: we have listened, acted and delivered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The aged care royal commission interim report, titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect</span>, came up with 148 recommendations, but it should come as no surprise that the former government did the absolute minimum. Combining the measures from the legislation we've passed and the two budgets that we have delivered, we have addressed in full or in part a total of 69 recommendations, and we have no plan to stop our work of reforming and transforming aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our second budget delivers a record 15 per cent pay increase for aged-care workers across Australia. This represents the biggest ever pay rise to aged-care workers. This budget allocates $11.3 billion over four years to fund the Fair Work Commission's interim decision for a 15 per cent increase to minimum wages for many aged-care workers. This will support around 92,100 award aged-care workers in New South Wales, who will earn between $129 and $341 more per week for a 38-hour week. For too long those working in aged care have been asked to work harder for longer without enough reward, but with this budget that changes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of the historic investment we are making in the budget, a registered nurse on a level 2.3 award wage will be paid an additional $196 a week. An enrolled nurse on a level 2 award wage will be paid an additional $145 a week. An assistant in nursing on a level 3 award wage will be paid an additional $136 a week. A personal care worker on a level 4 aged-care award or home-care worker on a level 3.1 SCHCADS award will be paid an additional $141 a week. A recreational activity officer on a level 3 aged-care award will be paid an additional $139 a week. A head chef cook on a level 4 aged-care award will be paid an additional $141 a week. But there's more. With the implementation of our aged-care legislation, we recognise the enormous amount of work of the government to support the aged-care sector to improve facilities and lift the quality of care for residents, including through increasing average care minutes and greater transparency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the honour of having the Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care visit my electorate this past week, and we visited Uniting Osborne House Nowra. We talk with aged-care residents over a cuppa and a scone. We talked with aged-care workers. We took a tour of the facility while talking further with aged-care workers. It was easy to see and hear the buoyed confidence in this aged-care home. The increase in pay, of course, is a game-changer, but the implementation of these recommendations will make a profound difference on aged-care workers lives, aged-care homes and our most treasured aged-care residents. We were also told how our fee-free TAFE is making a noticeable difference locally in people taking on aged-care courses and helping grow aged-care workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We said we'd put the care back into aged care, and we have. We're supporting aged-care workers. To all those thinking about a career or retraining: aged care has a bright future. Go for it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:01</span>):  Deputy Speaker Young, you've heard the last two speakers. One spoke glowingly about her facility in Nowra, and I asked if they have been able to get a full-time registered nurse to service their organisation. I wonder whether that's the case? You heard from the member for Indi a very in-depth discussion around the problems she is facing is a member of parliament in regional Victoria. I am equally a regional member of parliament, and every word that was spoken by the member for Indi is impacting directly on the people of Monash. They are exactly the same issues. They are everywhere right across the regional state. I haven't had closures, but, when the member for Indi said 74 per cent of aged-care facilities were running at a loss, you had to say, 'Well, has the government got a plan here?' You really have to ask the question.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's great that the government had decided that aged-care workers across all levels are going to get a 15 per cent pay increase. That then puts pressure on other organisations that are not getting a 15 per cent increase, and the competition for workers within community becomes quite strong. Therefore, it creates other problems. I am not denying the aged-care workers, as I have said for all of my political career, because I have had a long-term issue around aged care. I have been as hard on my own governments as I have been on Labor governments in the past. I have negotiated between state governments and federal governments when the state governments and federal governments were involved, right back to 1990, with Peter Staples as the minister up here and with the aged-care minister in Victoria—both Labor that couldn't get on. I was the negotiator between the two to try to get some action as to what might happen in one of the facilities in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My big question here is: yes, you've given a wage rise to aged-care workers. Yes, you've addressed the royal commission's recommendations. Yes, I think your intent is desirable, and I have heard intent before. When Labor members stand before us today and say 'nine years of neglect', that is not the truth. There were nine years of change, but it goes all the way back to 1996, with John Howard, when his outlay was $2 billion on aged care in those days. That went from two to four to six to eight to 12, and now we're in the hundreds of billions of dollars.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-GeneralInterjecting">An honourable member:</span>  That's why they called the royal commission's report <span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect</span>: because it was neglect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="MT4" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BROADBENT:</span>
                  </a>  I'll take the interjection. The royal commission was called by the former government, not this government. The former government was quite committed to whatever the recommendations were from that royal commission. I reject the 'nine years of neglect', but I would put to you that the royal commission identified certain establishments, certain providers, that were in neglect. I don't know what other members are faced with, but you would've visited your own aged-care centres. I can proudly say that my providers on the whole do a magnificent job. Every time there's been criticism of providers, I've had to write to every one of my aged-care workers and say, 'I know it's not you.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor does not have a plan for an overall future. If you give a wage increase like that, have you indexed it every year so that providers won't be paying that extra money every year and having to cop that as an expense against their business? Then, over 10 years, you have that increasing expense with no support from government to cover it. They're the issues that I'm concerned about, because providers are the last ones who are left with the bucket of money that they have to spend on their residents. I want the best for my aged-care people. I'm sure every member of parliament wants exactly the same thing.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:06</span>):  The Albanese Labor government cares deeply about aged care, those who rely on it and the dedicated individuals who work hard to provide quality care. We know that older Australians deserve better than the broken system that resulted from a decade of neglect by the previous government, and we are steadfast in our commitment to reforming aged care and addressing the critical issues facing the sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been a big first year of an Albanese Labor government for aged-care reform. We know that attracting and retaining aged-care workers has been one of the toughest challenges plaguing the aged-care sector, and that's why the Albanese Labor government's 9 May budget delivered an historic 15 per cent pay increase for aged-care workers across Australia. This is the largest pay rise ever for aged-care workers. This will benefit more than 250,000 workers. It reflected the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety's final report, which emphasised the need to improve remuneration for aged-care staff. It was a very clear direction from the royal commission, and our $11.3 billion investment delivers on our commitment to fund the outcome of the Fair Work Commission's decision. It's an independent decision of government, but we said we would back it because, unlike members opposite, we actually want to see wages growing in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Working in aged care involves physically and emotionally demanding work that requires great skill. The aged-care workforce deserves proper recognition for its efforts through fair pay. This pay rise was achieved through the advocacy of workers themselves, with strong support from their unions and this Labor government. Given that 90 per cent of aged-care workers are women, this wage increase not only helps make ends meet but helps address a gross gender pay inequity that has dogged this nation for a long time. The funding provided by the Albanese Labor government will help restore dignity to older Australians, as requested by the royal commission. It's also an essential part of our government's plan to create more opportunities for Australia by investing in health and aged care.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am confident that this will make a significant difference in my community of Newcastle. Aged-care facility workers in Newcastle tell me that attracting and retaining excellent staff is one of their toughest challenges. Like many female dominated sectors, aged care has been a severely underpaid sector for a long time, leading to staff seeking employment in other sectors. This pay increase addresses the initial two stages of the Fair Work Commission's decision on wages. However, the commission is still deliberating on a third, final stage, which pertains to the pay of support and administration staff in the sector. But those staff members can be assured that this government is committed to accepting and providing funding for whatever determination the Fair Work Commission arrives at. The government's commitment to boosting the aged-care workforce also includes initiatives such as fee-free TAFE, more university places, student clinical placements, extended visas and training programs. Collectively, these measures will help alleviate workforce pressures and support the sector, increasing actual hands-on care and ensuring that we are able to provide registered nurses available in each of the facilities 24/7.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are big challenges ahead, but doing nothing is not an option. The pay increase for aged-care workers is just one of 37 recommendations that the Labor government has now implemented from the royal commission's report since we took office just one year ago. The Albanese Labor government is committed to reforming the aged-care sector to provide the quality care our older Australians need and deserve. We've allocated a record $36 billion to fund the 15 per cent pay increase for aged-care workers, to increase the hands-on care and provide for 24/7 nursing care to be available.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, this funding will improve transparency regarding public funds allocated to the aged-care system and assist with the process of drafting a new rights based aged-care act. The Albanese Labor government stands resolute in its deep care of the aged-care sector. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr RYAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:11</span>):  In my electorate of Kooyong, more than 25 per cent of people are aged 65 or more. We have more than twice the nation's average proportion of residents aged more than 85. Aged care is a really important issue for this country. Our ageing population wants, deserves and needs high-quality aged-care services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are at least 27 aged-care facilities in my electorate alone. Last week, I was fortunate to have dinner at one of them, The Gables in Camberwell, with BlueCross CEO, Ingrid Harvey. The aged-care residents, my constituents, told me that in their residential facility, their home, they wanted to be cared for by people that they knew and that they felt comfortable with. They want to feel safe and secure. They also told me that they were very concerned about cost-of-living pressures and the effect of COVID on both themselves and their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The recent Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety highlighted the inadequacies of our aged-care system. It identified significant problems with the quality and safety of aged-care services across our country. It noted barriers to navigating and entering the aged-care system, including a lack of information to help people understand which aged-care services would best suit their needs; inadequate access to healthcare support amongst people who are receiving aged care; and, heartbreakingly, frequent instances of substandard care and abuse. We've heard a lot about that in the media in the last week alone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission made a total of 148 recommendations proposing a detailed strategy to change and improve our aged-care system. This government has addressed 37 of those recommendations, but there is still much work to do. We still need, as a matter of urgency, to address food and nutrition, dementia care, the use of restrictive practices and best practice palliative care in our aged-care system. We also need to address the aged-care workforce as a matter of urgency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aged care is a gendered issue in Australia. About two out of three people accessing aged-care services in Australia are women. Almost nine out of 10 aged-care workers in Australia are women. One-third of them are culturally and linguistically diverse, and one-third of them were born outside this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the recent budget, the government did deliver on its pre-election promise of a 15 per cent pay rise for aged-care workers. It's great to see that rolled out, but there are persisting issues with this workforce. Most of the 280,000 workers in our aged-care workforce are part-time—many of them, not out of choice. Residential providers in Kooyong tell me of the staffing shortages they face every day. The most recent CEDA report showed that 65,000 employees are leaving the aged-care sector every year, yet we need an additional 35,000 employees across the sector to meet care needs. Many aged-care workers are exhausted after working for three years to keep our community safe from COVID. In that context, it's disappointing to see the government cut the number of hours international students can work, given that student visa holders were crucial to the provision of aged care in this country during the pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no doubt that we have let down older Australians in recent years. By May 2021, three-quarters of the COVID-19 deaths in Australia were in aged-care residences. During the pandemic, many aged-care workers had to work in more than one facility because of issues with their rosters and work conditions. In doing so, they placed both themselves and aged-care residents at risk. Our government has now removed all workplace protections and paid-leave provisions for workers affected by COVID-19. This tells us that we have not yet learned the lessons of the pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's still much to do to ensure that older people are supported to live self-determined and meaningful lives and that our educated, skilled and dedicated aged-care workers can provide best practice, compassionate care. I look forward to working with the government to that end.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Four decades ago, tobacco advertising was banished from television by the Fraser government after courageous resistance to lobbying from vested interests. Since then, gambling advertising has filled the void, despite reams of evidence about the harm it causes. Recent survey results from the Australian Institute of Family Studies and the Australian Gambling Research Centre show that exposure to advertising is leading to riskier betting behaviour. One in five people started betting for the first time after seeing or hearing an ad. Three-quarters of those surveyed had gambled at least once in the last year. It's a slippery slope. In a recent study on the impact of advertising, an 11-year-old boy said: 'People want to watch the game and not see the ads. They don't need to be encouraged to have a bet.' A 14-year-old girl said: 'I'm a bit disappointed and sad that gambling is such a big part of sport now. It doesn't have to be about money.' In one study, most young people—79.3 per cent—said there should be no advertisements or fewer advertisements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ads used role models, such as former football or basketball stars, to validate the ads to young people. They make gambling look fun, aspirational, fashionable and almost more important than the sport being played. One 13-year-old said: 'Advertising makes it appear that it's really popular.' The reality, of course, is quite different. As the Victorian Responsible Gambling Foundation's February 2023 discussion paper outlines, the consequences of harm from gambling are poorer health and wellbeing for individuals who gamble and those around them. The paper goes on to say that the social cost of gambling in Victoria alone has been estimated at $7 billion a year, with financial harm being the third-highest cost after family and relationship problems and psychological issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only 30 per cent of those affected by the harm are defined as 'problem gamblers', and studies show that policy interventions restricting the timing and context of gambling advertising are not working. The total gambling ad spend in Australia has risen by 320 per cent since 2011. In Victoria, the gambling ad spend is about three times that spent on alcohol. An average of 148 ads are shown in family prime-time between six and 8.30 pm, and gambling ads are overflowing into non-sport programs, including those that appeal to children. This is all about normalising gambling, not as an add-on to sport but integral to it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government says, 'Wait and see what the committee inquiry currently underway comes up with,' but the minister has not committed to implementing whatever recommendations the Labor led panel comes up with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition says to ban advertising for an hour each side of games. The evidence is that this won't work. The Australian Communications and Media Authority has found that after the last attempt to restrict gambling ads during live sport, back in 2018, the total volume of gambling spots increased by no less than 50 per cent. The ads simply migrated to general programming, much of it watched by children and teenagers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We cannot wait a moment longer before calling time on this. We are reaching a point where our kids know more about multis than they do about the game. And it pays. Sportsbet, a foreign owned company, nearly tripled its revenue, from US$620 million to US$1.5 billion, in just 12 months, from 2019 to 2020. And they pay minimal tax—a mere $½ million annually—by locating their operations where the tax regime is most friendly, currently the Northern Territory. I'm aware of young teenagers in Goldstein who are gambling on apps; 72 per cent of parents are bothered by this, ACMA research says, and 76 per cent of AFL fans don't want it either, according to a recent survey, while 62 per cent said the AFL should not receive any revenue from gambling advertising. Eleven of 16 AFL club executives who were polled by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Age</span> in 2022 said the level of gambling advertising in the sport is excessive. One said the AFL had 'prostituted themselves to the gambling industry'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our system has normalised gambling, and we must fix it. Soccer-mad Belgium is leading the way, progressively getting rid of gambling ads, and sponsorship for pro teams will be phased out over five years. If we don't follow, there will be long-term consequences. The largest group of sports betters in Victoria is young men aged 18 to 24—part of the first generation to be subjected to ubiquitous and insidious gambling advertising.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="296272" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MILLER-FROST</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:21</span>):  Today I rise to speak on the motion put by the member for Goldstein on this very important issue of gambling harm. Australians are the biggest gambling losers in the world. There are other countries that have similarly large gambling cultures and gambling industries, but Australians lose more, on average, than those in those other countries. On a per capita basis, Australians are losing $1,300 per year, for a total of a staggering $25 billion a year. And of course we know that for everyone who doesn't gamble there are others who are losing much more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that gambling can cause significant harm to individuals, families and the community as a whole, and the number of people experiencing gambling harm has doubled in the past nine years. Gambling takes many forms in our community, from lotteries to on-site sports betting to casinos and pokie machines and, in more recent years, online gambling. It is online gambling, available on your smartphone or your computer 24/7, in your school, in your home or in your bedroom at night, that is now causing significantly escalating issues. The rate of harm among online gamblers is three times that among those using the physical gambling product, where you actually have to go out to a venue. It's for this reason that the Minister for Social Services referred the issue of online gambling harm to the Social Policy and Legal Affairs committee, chaired by the member for Dunkley and of which I am a member, and I recognise the member for Curtin here in the Chamber, who is also a member of that committee. The terms of reference include current protections and their effectiveness, support and education available, ensuring that protections are modernised and account for changing technologies, the definition of 'gambling service' in the Interactive Gambling Act and whether it should include and capture loot boxes and social casino games and other gambling-like mechanisms that are available to young people and children, the current advertising restrictions and their effectiveness at limiting children's exposure to gambling products and services, and protections against illegal gambling services, including offshore casino websites.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This committee has heard and continues to hear from a variety of stakeholders, including those who identified to us that they are gambling addicts, the families of gambling addicts, and gambling help support services, as well as the gambling industry, the advertising industry, the sports industry and academics who have knowledge of the Australian and international gambling sectors. Some of the stories we have heard are heartbreaking. Many from the public hearings are on the record. People have lost tens of thousands of dollars overnight—literally during a night. People have lost their houses, their redundancy payouts, their marriages, their jobs, their families and, sadly, much more. People have had to change their entire lives to avoid gambling triggers, such as sports stadiums, television, radio and social media.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government takes this very seriously. While the report will be handed down later this year—and I am very strongly committed to evidence based decision-making, so I am looking forward to that coming out—I would like to highlight three actions being taken already. The Albanese government is committed to ensuring online gambling takes place within a robust legislative framework with strong consumer protections, including the implementation of the national self-exclusion register BetStop. In the committee inquiry we heard from gamblers about the difficulty they have had trying to self-exclude from hundreds of online gambling sites only to find a new one pop up in their email the next day. BetStop will be the one-stop shop for self-exclusion. It will require licensed phone and internet wagering providers to check whether their consumer has self-excluded before they provide services. They will be required to promote BetStop on their websites, app and all other promotions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, while advertising is part of the terms of reference of the committee inquiry, we are acting on previous recommendations. As of 30 March, the previously legally required gambling advertising message of 'Gamble responsibly' has been replaced with alternating messages that focus more on the possibility of losing: 'Chances are you're about to lose' and 'You win some; you lose more.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, Deputy Speaker Young, you may be alarmed to know that, among the harms of online gambling and the really significant losses the committee is hearing about, 15 to 20 per cent of gamblers are gambling not only with money they cannot afford to lose but actually with money they don't have in the first place. It's for this reason that we will be eliminating gambling with credit cards.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300006" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHANEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:27</span>):  There's broad understanding that gambling, especially online gambling, does a lot of harm, but the data to back it up is actually astounding. As a country, we spend as much on gambling in a year as the federal government spends on social security and welfare. Australians have the highest gambling losses in the world, averaging nearly $1,300 a year each. At its extreme, gambling disorder is a medically identified behavioural addiction. It has a material effect on the brain's reward, prioritisation and stress symptoms. Some groups are more vulnerable: young people, men, culturally and linguistically diverse groups, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and people with mental health conditions or substance abuse issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Due to the threefold increase in gambling advertising over the last decade, to $287 million, gambling is now completely normalised in every aspect of life through ever-present advertising. Kids are prepared for gambling through skin-betting sites, loot boxes and social casino games, which are often owned by gambling companies. But, despite its normalisation, losing money through gambling remains highly stigmatised. A number of constituents have told me their stories or their children's stories, but they've wanted to remain anonymous because of the shame. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's broad community agreement that we have a problem. In mid-2022, a survey showed 71 per cent of Australians supported a ban on gambling ads. This support isn't partisan; it's well spread across voting intentions. I've had 50 constituents contacting me seeking action on this issue. Why is change so hard in this area if there is broad community support for better regulation? It all comes down to money and power. Foreign companies, sports codes, media and politicians all stand to benefit from the gambling industry, despite the social harm to the community. These powerful vested interests mean regulation is designed to serve the gambling industry, not to address community concerns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sophisticated foreign companies dominate the new online gambling market. They make huge profits by engaging in appalling predatory behaviours. Online gambling is particularly insidious because it is private and accessible 24/7. It creates a heightened sense of unreality. It's easy for companies to use your personal information against you. Through algorithmic decisions, spending opportunities are curated according to your vulnerabilities and how you play. If you try to stop, these companies lure you back with inducements. The media are captive, saying the sky will fall in if they lose their recently tripled gambling revenue, threatening the sustainability of local news and local content on television and radio. Sport is also captive to the gambling industry, relying on multiple, parallel income streams from advertising, sponsorship and bets themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A few weeks ago I had a complaint from a constituent who, despite being 62, ticked the under-18 box on the AFL app so he wouldn't be served up gambling ads. Despite this, he is still bombarded with them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Politicians from the major parties happily accepted $1.7 million in donations from gambling companies last year. This included a $19,000 Sportsbet donation slipping under the radar to the current Minister for Communications, who is responsible for regulating this area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of these vested interests at every level, regulation is messy and inconsistent, with multiple self-regulating industry bodies creating an inadequate patchwork, with confusing holes and gambling providers flocking to the Northern Territory in a race to the bottom.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The regulatory approach focuses on personal responsibility, blaming vulnerable victims who are subject to sophisticated predatory behaviour. I heard from one gambler who'd self-excluded from 100 sites and was still sent promotional offers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this context, I issue a challenge to the federal government: gambling must be regulated as a public health issue. You will need to be bold. Minor reductions in advertising are unlikely to be successful. The opposition's recent support for banning ads during free-to-air sports broadcasts is the very minimum. We need to go further into online ads and other types of promotion, otherwise the ads just shift. Partial bans have at best partial results. We need a nationally consistent approach.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After years of advocacy from the crossbench, the House Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, which I am a member of, will complete its inquiry into online gambling shortly and make recommendations. Then, our communities will watch to see if government will be brave and act in the public interest. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="282212" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms THWAITES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:32</span>):  Thank you to the member for Goldstein for bringing forward this motion. Gambling and its many harms are of great concern, and we are seeing huge amounts of money spent on gambling advertising. With that, we're seeing kids and young people and others exposed to gambling ads at a level that I doubt we've ever seen before and that I know many in our community do find concerning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've seen this in my own life, as I know many parents have. I recently sat down with my five-year-old daughter—it was the first time we let her stay up late to watch the footy on the TV. She is a Cats supporter—that's not my fault; that's her father's fault. But she stayed up late, and I was really shocked sitting there with my five-year-old to see so many ads and having to explain to her what those were about. So I, like many families, get that, and our government understands that we do need to minimise the harm associated with online gambling and gambling advertising as an absolute priority.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Across my community, I have had people tell me about their experiences of gambling and how worried they are for beloved ones who were struggling to break out of their gambling addiction. I recently sent out a community survey, and, in response, a Greensborough man told me that one of his biggest priorities for our government was that we address the intensive and unrelenting gambling advertising that we are bombarded with. He said that one family member of his was in danger of losing her house as a result of gambling addiction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the same survey, a woman from Heidelberg told me that with all the advertising just everywhere and on so many sites, especially online, sportsgrounds and the television, it's a real worry to watch. She was particularly concerned with the take-up of gambling among younger generations in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the same survey a man from Viewbank told me about the impact gambling addiction has had in his household. He said that his 19-year-old son has lost about $20,000 between last year and this year. This young son only earns $500 a week as an apprentice cabinetmaker. This man explained that all his son had to do was download the apps and create an account, and his son was, in his opinion, addicted to the apps.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we do see these harms in our community, and our government is very much aware of the harm that is being created. To these locals and to the many others across Jagajaga who I know are deeply and rightly concerned about the prevalence of gambling, I want to assure you that our government is committed to taking action. At the moment my good friend the member for Dunkley is chairing an inquiry into online gambling and its impacts on those experiencing gambling harm. I am really looking forward to seeing what I know will be serious and well-thought-through recommendations from that inquiry in the coming months. It is important that we address this issue and that we address it in a way where we have considered all the evidence before that committee before we act on those recommendations. Our government is eagerly awaiting that report and its recommendations in order to give them the consideration that they deserve. I know that many members of that committee are here in the Chamber. Thank you for the work you are doing on behalf of all of us in that committee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do recognise that it's not only people who are gambling who are impacted by gambling harm. The impact of significant problem gambling typically extends to around six other people. Moderate-risk gamblers affect up to three other people, and low-risk gamblers affect one other person. So when we see those ripple effects across our community we know this is not something we can have as situation normal. We do need to make improvements. We do need to make sure that what we have in place protects members of our community from harm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is committed to protecting consumers, their families and their communities from gambling harm, particularly that caused by problem online wagering. It is work we have already started. We have been taking action to reduce the impacts of problem gambling. We have already banned the use of credit cards for online gambling, bringing online wagering into line with land based gambling, where that rule was in fact already in place. We have implemented new taglines, mandated activity statements and committed to delivering a national exclusion register. These are important measures that will help to build a better culture of responsibility on the part of organisations in this industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear that our community wants to see changes to online gambling and related issues. They can see, like those of us in this place, that we have to take action on this. Our government has started the work. We do know there is much more to do. I do really look forward to seeing the recommendations of the inquiry in the coming months to see how best we can make this change to reduce gambling harm for people right across our country.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Small businesses make a significant contribution to our economy, accounting for about a third of Australia's GDP and employing more than 4.7 million people. In my electorate of Reid, small businesses are the lifeblood of the community. There are 26,000 small businesses located there. They not only grow our local economy but they also help weave together the social fabric. They have helped multiculturalism thrive by providing migrants with an opportunity to share their food and skills with their new communities. Burwood Chinatown is a wonderful example of that. Comprised of more than 50 hawker style food stores, business owners have brought their foods from their homelands to share. For example, malatang at the aptly named No. 1 Ma La Tang restaurant, shabu at Miyoshi, zong zi from Mum's Kitchen and even chicken feet from Chicken Feet King. These are all the cultural culinary delights finding a new audience in Sydney, and that is what makes small businesses so great—they add to our economy, employ locals and add to the dynamism of the place. They also give back to the community by supporting local schools, community organisations and sporting groups. For example, the Drummoyne chamber of commerce has a program to help high school students get early work experience so they can take that first critical step on the job ladder. They are fostering talent and building careers. The Majors Bay Road chamber of commerce regularly supports charities including the annual A Bloody Great Cause fundraiser to raise money for blood cancer research at Concord Hospital. Melanie Warman is the founder of Boobs on the Run, a small business supporting mums to get fit and take up running. She's also created a community of local mums who are supporting each other and building connections. That is what is so great about small businesses: they are of the community and give back to the community in so many ways.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we know small-business owners have had it tough over the past few years because of the impact of COVID. That is why the role of government in supporting small businesses to thrive is so important. That's what the Albanese Labor government is doing. We've provided energy efficiency grants so small businesses can reduce their emissions and reduce their operating costs, because it shouldn't just be big businesses with sustainability departments who benefit from the transition to renewable energy. We are providing one million small businesses with energy price relief three $650 rebate for eligible businesses. We're providing direct assistance by temporarily increasing the instant asset write-off threshold to $20,000. And, in an ever-changing digital environment, this government is funding a cyberwardens program to help protect small businesses against cyberthreats.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know one of the biggest challenges facing small businesses is finding skilled workers. Whether they are an aged-care provider, childcare centre, mechanic or cafe, small businesses are in desperate need for workers. Unlike those opposite, we believe in helping to train up a skilled workforce. We believe in a strong TAFE sector. This government is urgently working to address the critical skills shortages small businesses are facing, providing fee-free TAFE places because this government recognises that an economy thrives when small businesses thrive, and that only happens when small businesses can get the skilled talent they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a local representative, I also believe there are things I can do at the local level to support businesses in my area. Last week I invited Meta down to Rhodes to run a workshop for small businesses to provide them with training on how they can better use social media to connect with their customers. It's also why I put forward this bill: so I can speak about the wonderful businesses in my area and support them. I will continue to support them, promote them and advocate for small businesses in my local community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="MT4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BROADBENT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:42</span>):  I'm the product of small business. My grandfather was a grocer. My father was a draper. I ran retail Mensland stores, baizewear stores and drapery stores. I'm very proud of my background and the staff that worked with me all through those years. What I learned in my operation of small business—I never had any contact whatsoever with government through all my years. Neither did my father. Neither did my grandfather. We understood the rules. Our staff were under a national award, and we always paid over the award. There was never, ever a question about what the Broadbent companies paid their staff. We were proud of our relationship with our staff and, of course, with the community we represented, which changed as time went on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Italian community became the dominant community within the Koo Wee Rup area, my father employed young Italian people in the business so they could communicate directly with their fellow Italians. It was the same with the Dutch and the Germans—the same with anybody that came into our district. We had people who could participate in community just by the basic operational relationship being everything. Sales were important, but relationship was always more important for our community. So, when Australians were looking very closely at the recent budget—especially the Australian small business community—they were thinking, 'Jesus, don't put another burden on top of us again. Don't tax us again. Don't make changes again.' And across my years in this place—as the member for Riverina would know—I've found that small business wants one thing from governments: 'Get out of my life. Don't make changes to IR that directly affect my business. That is not beneficial to us having relationship with our staff that we need to have.' Through my time, I did not meet small business owners who ripped off their staff. If they did, people didn't work for them, in those days.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, it's really hard to get staff in a small business. It's never been harder. I can't walk anywhere in my electorate of Monash where there's not a sign in a window saying, 'We are hiring; come and talk to us; we want you to work with us; just come to the front desk.' I think only three times in my years in the business young people walked into my shops and said: 'Can I talk to Russell, please? I'd like a job.' And all three of them said, 'I don't want to be paid; I just want a job so I can say on my resume that I had a job.' Of course, what my father, my brother and I did, when we did bring them in each time, was that we paid them—of course we paid them—for the work that they did. Those three people turned out to be some of the best people we had ever employed. More than that, they went on to do fantastic things within the business community, over and above what we could do for them within the structures of our business, because they got a little start with us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I still meet young people now—well, I say 'young; they're 45 or 50—who say, 'Russell, you gave me my first job; you gave me my first opportunity.' That's what small business does, right across my community and from Darwin to Devonport and from Perth to Parramatta. They're the businesses out there that actually employ people every time and give people a start, give them a job after school, give them a job on Saturday morning, give them a job on Friday night. Yes, we have to employ them for three hours. We pay them for three hours, even if they do only two. But they learn what it is like to be in a very good small business, right across Australia. I know I identify today with the pride of every small business that makes the contribution that they make to our economy every day. I walk with them, I thank them, and I just ask government to get out of their way, because there's  an opportunity here for another young person to get their first job.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GOSLING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:47</span>):  I want to acknowledge the words of the previous speaker, the member for Monash. Just one piece of advice, though, is that we are supporting small business and interacting with them. So, it's not a case of government getting out of the way for small business. It's about how government can assist small business. That is what we're focused on: how government can help small businesses, which are the engine room of our national economy—and that's certainly the case in Darwin in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Across our nation, small businesses employ millions of Australians, and they're really at the heart of our local communities. Of the 2.5 million businesses in Australia, about 98 per cent are small or medium enterprises. Obviously in recent years, for a variety of reasons, thousands of small businesses across our nation have done it really hard, whether because of the impacts of bushfire or of extensive flooding or, of course, because of COVID, when a lot of small businesses were seriously affected. But any time that businesses, particularly tourism-exposed businesses, are hit, that's a real hit to the local economy and to people's jobs. So, it has been a tough time, but that's why our government is delivering for small business, by helping them to bounce back from these challenges and to improve their long-term resistance. We're doing this by providing $15.1 million for small-business owners to access free mental health and financial counselling support. We're also updating Commonwealth procurement rules so that small businesses get a bigger slice of the $70 billion of contracts that the Commonwealth government spends every year, by having a 20 per cent target.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very proud of the role that I've played, even from opposition, in leading some reform to the defence procurement rules and the packaging up of work that saw more local small and medium enterprises getting some of that work. I acknowledge that some of those reforms were taken up by the former government, but we're really driving it. It's so crucial to the defence industry, particularly in the Top End, where I represent the people of Darwin and Palmerston, but also across the Territory and across the country. When those big Commonwealth procurements are happening—multimillion- and even multibillion-dollar investments—we want our small and medium sized businesses to get the bulk of that work and to do very well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One quick example is Pattemore Constructions, which is a First Nations business based in Mcminns Lagoon, just out of Darwin city. They were hired to refurbish three accommodation buildings at Tindal air base in a project valued at about $2.6 million—not in the billions, but millions of dollars—and that is great for their business. They can develop their business. They can bring on more employees. Those jobs are so important, and reforming those Commonwealth procurement rules is really important to that small business in my community because it helps provide a bit more of a level playing field when they're bidding for work. The answer is not getting government to abandon small business by, 'getting out of the way'. It's about asking: how do we help and actively assist small business? We're doing that in a number of ways.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is also reviewing the Payment Times Reporting Act 2020 to consider options to achieve better payment terms and practices for small business. This is another legacy that we've inherited. We have small businesses that are waiting ages for government to pay them. They have been really disadvantaged by a lack of quick payment by government, so we are going to sort that. In the opening round, the first round, there's been $62.6 million in energy efficiency grants to eligible small and medium businesses to help address these rising costs. We've also talked about support for small businesses to help them with their energy bills, which is absolutely essential. I'm proud that our government is committed to actively assisting small businesses across our great nation.</span>

She studied it and she wants it to be better. The difficulty is, she's on a side of parliament that hasn't always regarded small business as something that is as important as it should be, as important as it must be and as important as it can be.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Solomon talked about the help that the government is giving businesses, via the budget, for power costs. It's like cutting someone's arm off then giving them a bandaid and saying, 'This will help.' It won't help. The person is obviously in far more pain than a bandaid can help. They need far more than just a bandaid. These are bandaid measures for businesses.</span>

                  </a>  I wasn't here at the time, Member for Moreton, but I certainly would've. Anyway, we'll move on. We know that 98 per cent of businesses in Australia are small to medium enterprises. I was once part of a small family owned business. I started and ran my own small business with a couple of partners, and that business was highly successful. It's tough out there.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard, prior to the election, the Prime Minister on nearly a hundred occasions talking about the power bill cuts for families and for small businesses, but they have not materialised. And why haven't those power bill cuts been enacted? Because they were never going to be. This government is about pushing power prices up, with its zealotry, with its philosophy, with its going down the renewables pathway too early, way too soon.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard the member for Monash talking about the difficulty in hiring people in his Victorian electorate. And it doesn't matter whether it's in his rural and regional centre, it doesn't matter where it is—right across this nation in many shop windows you are seeing signs that say 'work available, apply within'. There are so many job vacancies. Indeed, the Regional Australia Institute identifies 80,000 vacancies in the regions at the moment, vacancies which cannot be filled.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was talking to Neville Jolliffe and his wife, Jodi, who run independent grocers at both Coolamon and Forest Hill. They can't find people for love nor money. They cannot find people to fill those vacancies. They're happy to pay what they need to. They're a great couple who very much look after their staff. But, for them, it's like everybody else—I could mention the meat-processing plants, I could mention farmers, I could mention any area of endeavour, both unskilled and skilled, within the Riverina: there are job vacancies which simply cannot be filled.</span>

There was no limit on that instant asset write-off under us, and that policy came in at a time when things were difficult.

                  </a>  Will you be quiet and just listen? Maybe you'll learn something, Member for Moreton. You might just learn something, potentially, about the truckie tax which your side of the parliament has put on truckies. Many of them are family owned operations. Not to mention Scott's, refrigerated transport operators, which used to deliver all of the groceries around the country—they have gone to the wall. They have gone to the wall on your watch. They have gone to the wall, and what does that do? That pushes up grocery prices, which are already being hit by everything else that this government has put on them: more red tape, more bureaucracy, more tax. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the Labor way. This is what Labor does when it gets into power. It says one thing before it gets into power and does completely another thing after it gets into power. They have two faces; they absolutely do. This is so difficult for our small-business people, who are running this country, who are the backbone of the economy, who are taking the risks and who are paying everything that they need to, and then some, to keep their business doors open. Sometimes they go home with less money than their actual workers. Labor wouldn't understand that because most of them haven't ever run a business. Most of them have never taken that risk, most of them have never taken up the opportunity to do so, but they come in here and lecture us.</span>

Small business is a powerhouse in Australia's economy, in employment and in broader Australian life. Indeed, at the end of the last financial year, there were over 2.5 million actively trading businesses in Australia, and, of this number, almost 93 per cent had a turnover of less than $2 million.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my work before entering parliament I saw this firsthand, running economic development and small business support in local government. The breadth of business, from retail, the service sector and professional services to manufacturing, investment and IT—it was always impressive to see individuals and companies finding their opportunities, creating their own futures and making the Australian community and economy the stronger for it. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I welcomed the Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy, Jenny McAllister, to Boothby to meet with a couple of local businesses that have seized the opportunities that energy transition poses for businesses and households to save on their power bills and cut their emissions at the same time. MAC Trade Services focuses on helping households become more energy efficient, and efficiency at the Tonsley Innovation District assists businesses large and small with their energy transition. These are both great Boothby businesses that have seen an opportunity and gone after it, and that is the great entrepreneurial spirit that drives the small-business sector in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why the Albanese government is delivering for small business. The broader economic agenda is designed to strengthen conditions for small business. Most importantly, we have listened to small businesses about the challenges they are facing and we are putting strategies in place to address those challenges. We heard about the shortage of skilled labour, so we put in place reforms like cheaper child care and an increase in skilled migration. Our implementation of fee-free TAFE places for areas of skills need is helping train the workforce and the small-business owners of the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard small businesses when they asked for more targeted support for help in the current inflationary environment. In the budget, we announced up to $3 billion in energy bill relief for eligible small businesses and households through the energy bill relief fund, in partnership with state and territory governments. This money will flow to around a million small businesses. In South Australia, the combined rebates for eligible small businesses will total $650 per customer off their energy bills. This builds on the $62.6 million energy efficiency grants program that we committed to in last year's October budget, which adds a 20 per cent tax deduction for energy efficiency upgrades.</span>
              </p>

On 1 July 2024, employers will be able to provide Single Touch Payroll engagement authority to their tax agents for extended periods. This will result in the elimination of unnecessary duplication of paperwork for Single Touch Payroll lodgements.</span>

This can achieve better outcomes for taxpayers by delivering quicker and cheaper resolution of disputes. We're also expanding the number of tax clinics nationwide so more small businesses can receive tax assistance. Treasury will consult with the small-business community in late 2023 to identify further opportunities to reduce regulatory and engagement challenges that small businesses face in their interactions with government.</span>

Online services and retail can be amazing opportunities to open up new markets that aren't restricted geographically or by opening-hour constraints. But, as we've seen increasingly over recent years, the online world poses many hazards for both business and their customers. The government will provide $23.4 million over three years, from 2023-24, for a Cyber Wardens program to support small businesses to build in-house capability to protect against cyber threats. More than 15,000 small businesses will be supported to train around 50,000 cyber wardens.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I move this motion in utter exasperation. I'm at a loss when I try to understand why this Labor government would even consider its radical changes to the dispensing of medicines. I know that there is a natural predisposition because there will be some savings initially for the public. I understand why the public would think that that is a good thing. However—and I know those opposite don't really care about regional and rural Australia—community pharmacies and industry professionals across my electorate of Fisher have reached out to me very upset at the impact that Labor's decision will have on their services. Their customers and clients, many vulnerable Australians living beyond the big cities, have spoken to me about their own fears about access to health care, and they are right to be afraid. Labor has slashed mental health funding. They have hacked at a decade of progress on Medicare. They've dismantled our world-class telehealth system. They promised urgent care clinics would be built, and 12 months on we don't even know where they'll be. They've abandoned primary health care in regional Queensland at the state and federal level, and now, just like last time, this federal Labor government is making vital medicines more difficult to access for Australians in need.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">You see, this is the difference between those opposite and those in opposition. The government believe that they are the doyens of all things. They believe that big government knows best without consulting the people who will be impacted. Did the government consult with pharmacies? Did they talk to small rural and regional pharmacies as to the impact that this would have? And it's not just the impact upon the pharmacies; it's the impact it will have if and when those pharmacies actually have to close up shop because they can't make a dollar anymore. Did they think about that? They won't guarantee supply for rural and regional communities or smaller pharmacies. They haven't thought about medicine stockpiling. They can't answer these questions because they have no idea. Why is that? It is because they didn't consult. Their priorities are out of order. They are out of touch with the needs of everyday Australians—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Community pharmacists and small business owners are already contending with Labor's cost-of-living crisis. They are now facing a crushing blow from this arrogant Labor government. Community pharmacies are telling me that this decision could cost them everything, and our communities will ultimately pay the price. I think especially of a community pharmacy in one of my rural towns, Montville, a community that no longer has a GP, thanks to state and federal Labor. Now their pharmacy is at risk of closing its doors. That's the cost of a Labor government. Marie from Sippy Downs and Warren from Golden Beach share concerns of the impact that this will have on the communities they service. Stan from Maleny called the move 'disastrous'. John from Mooloolaba said it was reckless and irresponsible. Reckless, irresponsible, disastrous—that's a three-word slogan for the Albanese Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The idea that pharmacies would close left, right and centre across regional Australia would have been a ludicrous proposition just 12 months ago. Our pharmacies played a vital role in helping our country through the COVID-19 pandemic. The idea that any government would reward their hard work with this reckless intervention is astounding. It is just plain wrong. But after just 12 months of a callous and careless Labor government, Australians are not surprised. Australian families and their businesses always pay more under Labor.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:08</span>):  I really am very loath to get involved in negativity and argument about this motion. As you know, Madam Deputy Speaker Chesters, I've worked in the healthcare system for over 40 years. I've had a great relationship with all of my local pharmacists and I've appreciated their hard work, in particular the work that they did to stay open and provide services for their patients during the pandemic. I know how hard many of them work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This policy that the member for Fisher has described is actually sensible healthcare policy that will deliver better and more efficient healthcare outcomes for the whole of Australia. There is no doubt that this is long overdue. This has been talked about in healthcare circles for 20 or 30 years. The idea that someone who is stable on a long-term medication has to go back to their pharmacy every 30 days to get repeat prescriptions is crazy. The idea that people have to go back to their GPs every few months to get repeat prescriptions is also crazy. That's why the government is extending the GP prescription time to 12 months and is allowing people to pick up 60 days—two months supply—of their regular, long-term medications without having to go back every 30 days to the pharmacies. It's sensible, it's efficient and it saves money. It is better healthcare policy. This is a bit like taxis versus Uber. Uber has changed the system. It's more efficient. People like it and people want it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have the biggest electorate in Australia by population. I've had not one patient complain to me about the 60-day prescribing. There have been lots of complaints from pharmacists. They were consulted. They're the ones that walked away from the table. The Pharmacy Guild walked away from discussions. They drew a line in the sand and then walked away. I'm encouraging them to come back to the table to talk about how we can help their pharmacies, which, by the way, have been earning record incomes in the last five years. I'm saying, 'Come back to the table, and let's talk about this.' But this is sensible healthcare policy. It is better for patients. It's better for our system. It gives GPs more time to deal with patients, and we know that, in the last 10 years, there has been an exodus of general practitioners. We just haven't been able to get them. The previous government sat on their hands and did nothing, and, when we introduce sensible healthcare policy, all we get from the opposition is negativity and argument. As I say, I have the greatest respect for our local pharmacists, but this is the 21st century. We must make our systems more efficient. We must make them work better for patients, and this is a start. As the minister has noted, we understand very well that the Pharmacy Guild has to represent their members and we understand what they're talking about, but they are the ones that walked away from the table. They must come back, and we must talk about how we can make our system more efficient.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Pharmacy Guild uses ridiculous arguments like, 'More children are going to die of overdose because of this.' There's absolutely no evidence of this whatsoever, yet they keep on saying silly things like that. They're talking about compliance issues. Compliance will actually be better with 60-day prescribing, and it is crazy that they would say otherwise. We know there is a problem with young males in particular who are on regular medication going back and getting repeat scripts and getting their medication from the pharmacy. This will make compliance better. The 300 medications that will be covered under this policy will be introduced slowly. There will be no increase in medicine shortages over those we have now. We've had medicine shortages because of the policies of the previous government over the last 10 years. We've learned how to deal with that, as have pharmacies. It's important to note that nearly a million Australians every year are forced to go without their prescriptions because of cost, and this will reduce cost to patients and make it more efficient. More people will be able to afford their medications because of this 60-day prescribing. This policy is important. It brings benefits to over six million Australians who won't have to go back every 30 days the pharmacy to get medications they may well have been stable on for over 20 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is good policy. There will not be increased medication shortages. I doubt very much that businesses will go broke and close. This is not true; this is a fallacy. This government is doing what is best for healthcare policy, and the minister is to be congratulated.</span>

                  <a href="282981" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:13</span>):  The coalition strongly supports affordable access to medicines for all Australians, and we have a strong record to prove it. When we were last in government, we listed more than 2,900 new or amended medicines on the PBS, at an overall investment of around $16.5 billion. However, many concerns have been raised with me in my office by community pharmacists about what impact the government's 60-day dispensing change will have on their small and family business. In fact, many are concerned this this change could force the cost of other items to increase, so that Australians end up paying more during a time when they are already doing it tough. Like many of Labor's policies, it sounds good, but there are always consequences down the line, including what it will mean for the many thousands of people employed by a pharmacy. We've just heard the member for Macarthur describe this policy as an interrupter, like Uber. Well, this certainly is an interrupter to small and family businesses—those pharmacists who own pharmacies across the Gold Coast in my electorate. The challenges will be diabolical for 5,700 community pharmacies across the nation, 120 of which are based on the Gold Coast—which is the small-business capital of our nation, with 72,000 small businesses. That's what many of these pharmacies are—small and family businesses, and I will always stand up for those small-business and family business owners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this month I met with local Gold Coast community pharmacists and representatives from the Pharmacy Guild—Kyril, John, Anand, Amanda, James and Paul—to listen to their concerns surrounding these changes. Their message was abundantly clear: these changes will be dire for small and family businesses within the sector. James, who owns three pharmacies in my electorate, said that if these changes were implemented he would see the bottom line of his business halved. Even worse, James said that under these changes he'd have no choice but to close one of his businesses and it would become impossible for his business to stay afloat. This is simply not good enough. Labor is sending small and family business to the wall—intentionally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is currently facing a medicine shortage, and many of my local pharmacists have warned that half of the eligible medications under the 60-day dispensing changes are already in low supply. Double-dispensing medications that are already low in supply will only add to that supply shortage. What's the government's plan to address that? I'm guessing they probably don't have one. Not only will these changes lead to further stress on our local community pharmacists but there is also concern that customers will panic-buy and stockpile medication, leading to further shortages and increased medication wastage. Nothing about this is good for small or family businesses, remembering that they employ thousands of people across our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the coalition have been listening to the genuine concerns of pharmacists and the Pharmacy Guild, their concerns have fallen on deaf ears when it comes to this Albanese government. James said that in one of his pharmacies, 54 per cent of his dispensary script numbers will be eligible for 60-day dispensing, and because of that he'll experience a drop of 20 per cent of his gross profit. When you're running a business, 20 per cent of your gross profit goes into the salary bill. These changes will mean that he will have to let go 12 of his 31 staff members—who also have their own families—across his three businesses. That's 12 more people on the unemployment line from just one small, family business that is a pharmacy. All the pharmacists I spoke with echoed those metrics and are completely distressed about the changes. They are calling out for a lifeline and this government is offering them exactly nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many questions the government needs to answer regarding these changes. How will they ensure that regional and rural communities—which they don't care about—are able to access the required supply of medications? How will they ensure small community pharmacies are able to access the required supply of medications? How will they prevent stockpiling of medicines? Can they guarantee that community pharmacies will not be negatively impacted by these changes? If they can't answer these simple questions, how are our community pharmacies meant to have any confidence whatsoever in the government and their decision-making?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition acknowledge the current cost-of-living crisis faced by Australians living with chronic illness. We have been calling on the government to provide a strong guarantee that this change will not harm the viability of community pharmacies. We also want to ensure the policy does not have perverse impacts for Australians more broadly, including pharmacy closures which, in turn, would put pressure on the health system. Why do Australians always pay more under this government?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="296272" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MILLER-FROST</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:18</span>):  I am particularly pleased to speak to the member for Fisher's motion on why people will spend less on medicines under Labor. It is ironic that those opposite put up something about the cost-of-living issue and yet all they can come up with are scare tactics and complaints. The change referred to in this motion was one announced as part of this month's budget, when the health minister—and my electoral neighbour and colleague—Mark Butler, announced that the government would be introducing 60-day prescribing and dispensing for stable, ongoing conditions. What this will mean, in effect, is cheaper medicines for at least six million Australians who take one or more of the 320 common medicines safety-assessed by the PBAC for this scheme. The list of medicines includes common medicines for blood pressure and cholesterol as well as other regular ones, and patients will save up to $180 a year per medicine. Those on healthcare cards will save $43.80 a year per medicine. The change brings Australia into line with comparable countries like the UK, France and Canada. New Zealand has had 90-day dispensing for over two decades—the world didn't end!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This change was a recommendation of the independent Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee in 2018 and was ignored by the former government. It's a recommendation that could have saved Australians millions of dollars a year for the past five years, but it was ignored.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear, the purpose of the health budget is to improve the health of Australians. Overseas evidence shows that longer dispensing times is not only safe but it actually increases medication compliance by up to 20 per cent. Why would this be? When medications are affordable, people are more likely to be able to take all of their medicines regularly as prescribed. Each year, over a million Australians delay or go without medication because they can't afford it. Secondly, if you're going to have a gap in your medication, it's likely to be at the end of your script because, perhaps, you haven't been to your GP on time or, perhaps, you haven't been to the pharmacy to refill it. Gaps in regular medications have impacts on the management of chronic conditions and risk factors. This is good policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's another great benefit of this move to longer dispensing times. That is, patients won't have to attend their GP to get prescription renewals so regularly, and this means GPs will be freed up to see other patients. We all know how hard it is to get in to see a GP after six years of Medicare rebate freezes under those opposite impacted the number of doctors choosing to become GPs. So this move is clearly the right thing to do for patients.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I acknowledge that it has impacts on community pharmacists, and I have spoken to many of them. Community pharmacy provides an important and essential role in our system, and I know the minister for health is committed to ensuring this remains the case. The Australian health system is a blended public and private system, and it's important to the health system as a whole that we have a strong community pharmacy sector. However, we don't have unlimited resources and the health budget needs to make decisions in the best interests of Australian patients. We are a country with an ageing population and a rising prevalence of chronic disease. Demand for health services is rising, and we need to make sure that the system is efficient. This policy aims to address an inefficiency in the health system that sees Australian taxpayers and patients pay more for essential services than they need to, it ties up GPs for script renewals and it drives poorer health results from medication non-compliance. This change affects 1.5 per cent of pharmacy revenue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Crucially, every dollar saved by the government through this change will be reinvested in community pharmacies. Pharmacists have increasingly become providers of immunisation services. They will be funded to reach out in aged care for pharmacy reviews. Some states are running trials or inquiries into prescribing rights for pharmacists for certain medications or conditions. This will require a change of business model for community pharmacy, but pharmacists and, yes, the pharmacy owners have been crying out for expanded scope of practice for years, and this health minister is looking into it. To be clear, the minister is looking into it because the entire health system needs a rethink, needs change, in order to meet the changing and growing needs of Australians. Perhaps the Pharmacy Guild should return to the negotiating table.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every year nearly a million Australians are forced to delay or go without medicine that their doctor has told them is necessary for their health because they can't afford it. This will fix that.</span>

It's: 'Hey, I've got a good idea. Let's try it!'—trying it without consulting and with very little road testing or consideration of the consequences. On the face of it, we have something that looks like not a bad idea: two-month prescriptions. Certainly that'll suit me okay, thank you, even though it would be fair to say that I probably don't need a reduction in cost. Fewer visits to the pharmacy will save me time, and there will be a $1.2 billion saving to the budget over the forward estimates. What's not to like? Let's get out there and sell it. But let's not tell the pharmacists. After all, they're filthy, stinking rich, and they will only whinge about the changes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the government did not give the pharmacy industry sufficient insight into this change, and those on that side of the Chamber have demonstrated that they have a dearth of practical experience. It's fair to say they do have one member who, I believe, has been a pharmacist. I don't think she's speaking today on this bill. But if they'd thought this through, they may well have considered what impact the loss of income may have on community pharmacies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are visits to aged-care facilities. The previous member mentioned visits for aged-care facilities, and I'll come back to them in a moment. There are hospital visits to inspect drug cabinets, dispensing dates, how staff are actually managing the dispensing of drugs and staff education. There are the blister packs. There is a payment for blister packs, but it will halve under this policy. I was speaking to a number of pharmacies in small towns who actually deliver the blister packs. There's no payment for that. There's a knock on the door: 'How are you, Mrs Jones? Here's your blister pack.' That's a very welcome call from the pharmacy and their staff. Furthermore, regular visits to the pharmacy—with stable pharmacists and stable workers—is a chance to size people up as they walk across the floor to you. Is that too much? Who knows?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've taken quite a number of calls from pharmacists. They commonly expect to take a hit of a couple hundred thousand dollars to their bottom line on this and they're now wondering what kind of impact that will have on the net worth of their business. It's clear to me that, if this is a good idea, it should have been part of the Seventh Community Pharmacy Agreement, which will need to be negotiated again within the next 18 months. If there is to be a payment for aged-care visits or if there is to be an increased payment for blister packs, it should have been done at the same time that the government was proposing to slash their income. At the moment it has just caused a heap of instability.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was speaking to a young pharmacist in a small country town. She has owned the pharmacy for four months. She bought it on the figures of the last two years. She has taken out a significant loan and she does not know the full impact on her business yet. I said to her, 'What will you do?' She said, 'Something will probably have to go.' I said, 'Where do you go for that?' She said, 'It'll have to be a staff member—or two—or perhaps I will have to get rid of my backfill pharmacist who gives me a holiday, because I don't think I'll be able to afford that, and we will have to get rid of some of the services that we are offering in the community for little or no pay, and that includes the aged-care visits.' She certainly can't see any savings—and this is a matter for another debate, I'm sure—in her electricity bill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The predominance of PBS prescriptions go to the over-55s, and of course, as we age, the percentage of people on multiple prescriptions increases. It's worth noting that the PBS safety net is at $262.80 at the moment, and many people on those concessions will meet that headline amount in April, May or even June. For those people, there will be no saving at all. It'll be $262.80 this year, and it'll be $262.80 under the changes. It is interesting that a government that says it is about addressing the cost of living is actually giving a break to someone like me and not to an age pensioner. It seems to be a very blunt way of addressing these issues, and that is why I say again that it should have been part of the seventh pharmacy agreement. This should be done in global consideration, not in a one-hit, out-here-on-its-own, thought-bubble process. That's what you get when you don't think through the processes. It seems to me there has been little consultation, no consideration and no plan.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:29</span>):  There is no question that community pharmacies are a vital part of our primary healthcare ecosystem. That has been the case for a long time. It was brought home to all of us with even greater clarity through the experience of the pandemic, and I know that pharmacies in Fremantle, East Fremantle and Cockburn are building blocks of wellbeing in the communities I'm fortunate to represent. The Albanese government sees two things very clearly. First is the fact that our primary healthcare system as a whole needs some fairly urgent remedial care and attention after a decade of neglect. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Second is the fact that cost-of-living pressures are causing too many Australians to choose between important medicines or perhaps to skip taking these medicines altogether. In the budget that has just been handed down, we have put in place a phased transition to 60-day dispensing arrangements for a range of medicines that Australians need for the management of chronic health conditions. This motion, while apparently supporting the change, calls on the government to strongly guarantee various things. Perhaps those opposite should reflect on the fact that their government completely failed to provide full-cycle funding for the programs under the seventh community pharmacy agreement.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  In 2021, the three Labor MPs in the Peel region promised big on health care. David Templeman, Lisa Munday and Robyn Clarke were elected promising to fix our local hospital and have even dubbed themselves the 'dream team'. The truth is they've been a vision of incompetence and low energy. I've stood here many times to expose the appalling mismanagement of the Peel Health Campus by WA Labor. But last Friday Labor's negligence was on full display. Patients were diverted from the hospital after black mould was found in the aircon system and—surprise, surprise—the dream team remained silent. This is unacceptable.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've called on Premier Mark McGowan and his MPs to do their jobs and deliver urgent upgrades to our hospital, as they promised. They've had 6½ years. People are at their wits' end; they have had enough of the second-rate excuses about why works haven't started yet. That was why, on Saturday, almost 300 frustrated locals joined me and the WA state Liberal leader, Libby Mettam, at my health forum. Libby and I listened to worried locals tell us about the struggles they have faced at the Peel Health Campus because of Labor's delays and inaction. The message was loud and clear: Mike McGowan and WA Labor have let us down, but we won't give up. We won't stop fighting until we have a hospital fit for purpose to meet the needs of our community. From this Chamber, I thank the locals who attended. I thank the nurses and healthcare workers who attended and shared their voice to inform better public policy making in Western Australia.</span>

Ged Kearney, Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care; and Dr Fei Sim, the national president of the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia. The town hall was also attended by women and men of all ages and experiences, from medical students just starting out in their profession through to mothers and daughters with their own healthcare stories to tell, as well as experienced aged-care professionals. The stories told by the attendees made it abundantly clear that the experience of those present accorded with the research, which shows there is an endemic gender bias of medical misogyny throughout our health system.</span>

The new National Women's Health Advisory Council will act to identify and eliminate gender bias in our health system. Health care is hard enough without an entrenched bias against half of the population. </span>

They described an extraordinarily sophisticated scam in which they lost $300,000 to Australian and international fraudsters. I'm also hearing from other constituents, from students to retirees, about the increase in financial scams in our community. The ACCC and ASIC have reported that Australians lost billions of dollars to fraudsters last year, an 80 per cent increase from 2021, and that at least 30 per cent of scams don't get reported. Australia's existing methods to combat financial crime related to scams are failing. I welcome the government's commitment to fund a national effort to prevent scams but it doesn't go far enough to prevent the sophisticated exploitation of bank accounts and payment systems that are central to the scam business model.</span>

In the UK, we have seen that this is effective in reducing scams because it incentivises banks to develop the schemes that we need for them to better manage our risk. We have to increase our resistance against financial scams. This is important for all Australians. </span>

Volunteers are the heart and soul of any thriving community. They play an important role in helping those in need. Many of the organisations that support our local community are run by volunteers, including Parramatta Mission in the heart of Parramatta, which provides services to homeless people and many others; the Salvation Army; the BAPS temple in Rosehill; the Parramatta Female Factory Friends; and our local sporting clubs—the Lions, the Cougars, the Waratahs, Rydalmere FC and the Parramatta District Cricket Association.</span>

These organisations help make Parramatta such a wonderful place to live. On behalf of the local community, I thank our volunteers for their contributions.</span>

Flynn identified a need in our community for a safer pedestrian crossing on Thomas Street, around the corner from my electorate office. Flynn's speech won the 2021 Victorian Parliament Prize, but it is our local community that today has a safe pedestrian crossing because of his advocacy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2023 Bayside Youth Awards honoured Flynn, as well as Tommy Zhou, Marianne Huebel, Ben Adler and Milla Besanko. Tom is a budding journalist and is the editor-in-chief of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Kid</span><span style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">pirit</span> magazine. Three years ago, Tommy moved to my electorate from Shanghai, and Goldstein is lucky to have him. Marianne collects, cleans and resells outgrown toys to reduce landfill. I'm inspired by Marianne, whose projects are innovative and sustainable. Ben is a school-aged entrepreneur whose small business is helping households improve their access to emergency services by painting house numbers on the curb. Milla organises monthly clean-ups, collecting, weighing and counting litter. I attended Milla's Clean Up Australia Day event where she oversaw 30kg of rubbish collected from Brighton Beach.</span>

Their communities, like my own of Macquarie, are rich with creative talent, but, for the past decade, they haven't had a government really in their corner.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government recognises the importance of the arts to all communities in the city and beyond. Our cultural policy, Revive, is about giving Australians access to the arts wherever they live, and we're backing that with new funding. We're investing an additional $199 million in Creative Australia, allowing it to support more artists to create work and allow more audiences to experience it. It's also why we're making a massive increase in the Regional Arts Fund from $3.6 million a year to $5.8 million a year. It's why we're investing $80 million to establish a national Aboriginal art gallery in Alice Springs and $5 million to upgrade facilities at the NAISDA Dance College on the Central Coast. It's why we're increasing support for community radio, which will amplify regional and local voices and support new Australian music.</span>

Bill started out as an apprentice butcher in 1959 at the age of 15. He then went into partnership and opened a butcher shop in 1970. Then Bill and his wife, Lyn, went on to open their own butcher shop—Darragh's Butchers—in 1981. The first shop was in Barker Street, and they later moved to the Casino Plaza Shopping Centre, where the shop has been located for the last 30 years. Bill and Lyn have employed many people from the Casino area, including butchers, apprentices and clean-up kids. Many of their current and previous employees, family, friends and locals attended their retirement celebrations.</span>

Lyn is looking forward to retirement. Bill and Lyn have two children, Tony and Joanne; five grandchildren, Stephanie, Chloe, Christopher, Simon and Katie; and one great-grandchild, Tomie. Thank you, Bill and Lyn, for the many decades of your wonderful service to our community, and enjoy your retirement.</span>

Since 2022, these bright minds have immersed themselves in the world of robotics, dedicating their time to learning, designing, building and programming competitive robots for the renowned VEX Robotics tournament. My, oh my, have they exceeded expectations. After triumphing through local, regional and national challenges, three teams from Creator Academy joined representatives from 70 countries across the world in the world championship, held in Dallas, Texas just two weeks ago. Team Australia was made up of local students Ethan Wang, Wenxin Wang, Helena Tuo, Emily Tse, Mia Chen, Mia Cai, Eric Zhou, Jason Gong, Marcus Bai, Yanrui Xu, Marcus Liang, Jeshua Liang and Jonathan Dang. Team Phoenix Tech achieved a remarkable top eight result in the VRC middle school division. Then the Mecha Magpies earned an admirable 96th place out of 800 in their robot skills ranking. The youngest team, the Dingo Roos, secured a commendable 57th place out of 800 in skills and a fifth place in their division.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:11</span>):  Earlier this month, I had the privilege of attending Bathurst's proclamation day celebrations, when the city's newest Living Legends were announced and honoured. Ten minutes before the ceremony, the weather was looking pretty promising. Then, just after legendary and stoic MC Christopher Morgan started the formalities, the weather closed in. However, the rain and wind could not dampen the spirits of all those who attended to give the legends the thanks and appreciation of the community.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bathurst Living Legends for 2023 are Dave Conyers, the Angel of Eugowra. His mission was to air-condition Eugowra, and he succeeded. Bill Deeley is a legendary local historian and community pillar involved in a wide range of organisations, including U3A and Probis. Tanya-Lee Holmes is founder of Imperfectly Perfect Sugar Cookies and a fundraiser and advocate for those with disabilities, our veterans and many others—plus she's also the mum of famous young athlete Rooster. Matt Irvine is a legendary community worker involved in a host of local organisations and causes, including rotary Youth Driver, Bathurst Community Transport, Bathurst Show, the local health district and RFS. Gerry Ryan is already a legend in the local hockey community. He's made an enormous contribution to the sport, to local tourism through Ryan's Coaches and Gold Country Tours and also to Bathurst Council through his work there. Jim Schaerf is legendary for work with Landcare and protecting the environment. Since 2016, he's picked up over 1,800 bags of litter from local streets and roadsides. Congratulations to all the Bathurst Living Legends for 2023. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  I begin just by paying my respects to Geoff Love, who was a local activist and someone who loved environmental issues. In fact, we met on the polling booth, where he was proudly supporting the Greens candidate. Despite us being in different parties, Geoff Love was a gentleman, a very good person and cared about our community. We both shared deep love of the St Kilda Port Phillip EcoCentre as well as Elsternwick Park. I pay my condolences to his family. He was a very fine person.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge and thank the wonderful volunteers at ACF Macnamara and the Kinglake Friends of the Forest. These are amazing people who joined me in a recent trip out to the Toolangi forest to spot gliders. It was pretty spectacular to be out in the middle of the night, looking at some of the most endangered species that Australia has to offer. The job was to go find these amazing little gliders, document where they were in the forest and then pass on that information to the department. The whole point of that is to be able to preserve this critically endangered species. To see those volunteers giving up their time for conservation and for the future of our amazing wildlife is inspiring, and I was proud to join them the other night.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mitchell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:14</span>):  I rise to put on record my condemnation of two decisions of the newly elected Minns government in New South Wales. We haven't had a Labor government in New South Wales for a very long time. The recently elected New South Wales Labor government announced that they would not be proceeding with the Sydney Metro line extension from Rouse Hill to St Marys, which ultimately goes to the Western Sydney Airport. I believe that's an unbelievably bad decision given the time and effort the federal government have put into ensuring that Sydney has a second airport and that the proper transport links to one of Sydney's fastest-growing corridors are ready in advance. I call on the members for Greenway, Parramatta and McMahon to come forward to state their position on the new Labor government's decision to abandon a key piece of infrastructure for Western Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Further to this, the second decision I mention today, which I'll have more to say about, is the incoming Labor government's announcement that they will not increase the dam wall at Warragamba Dam, Sydney's main water source. Not only is this a huge flooding risk for the Penrith and Hawkesbury valleys, affecting corridors of growth for people with the floods that we've seen in recent years when we've had La Nina. Flooding in these areas is impacting people's houses and communities. With the population increases that we're going to see in Sydney, will we once again go back to a situation where Sydney will be without water when the next drought comes? I believe that a Labor government coming to office and cancelling two major infrastructure projects for Western Sydney and the future of Sydney is short-sighted and will stand them in bad stead in the future.</span>

Stephen Greene, a beloved local, dedicated himself wholeheartedly to the Waverley Blues Football Netball Club, enriching the lives of its members and supporters over many memorable years. Sadly, Stephen recently passed away.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Stephen embodied the true essence of a volunteer in our community. The stories that have emerged since his passing have been extraordinary. From his active participation as a player, junior coach, game-day medical trainer, goal umpire and list manager to his invaluable role as head recruiter and committee member, Stephen was the epitome of a great clubman. He remained an integral part of the club, with the Waverley Blues considering him part of the furniture and someone who was always ready to lend a helping hand whenever the need arose.</span>

Earlier this month the Waverley Blues open-age teams, players and officials wore 'Greene' armbands as a mark of respect for Stephen Greene. I extend my sincere condolences to the entire Waverley Blues community and specifically to his family, including his wife, Briony; his children, Amy, Adam and Tom; his father, Joey; and his mother, Dianne; along with his extended family and friends, during this difficult time. </span>

During my recent doorknocking it has been very clear that no consultation has taken place up to this point, and there is a deep desire from residents to be involved in that process. I will always support investment in our city, but I do believe we need to get the investment right to ensure that it supports our local economy, jobs, businesses and, most importantly, residents. Speaking to those residents it's clear that there are already issues regarding noise, congestion and parking that arise when events are held at the stadium with its current capacity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll continue consulting with my community to understand their concerns and how this will impact them, their lifestyles and local amenities. Sadly, at the moment there are lots of unanswered questions. I urge all locals who wish to have their say on the development of the Clive Berghofer Stadium to complete the survey that can be found on my website and Facebook page and in my regular email updates. It's vital that your voices are heard through this process, and I commit to ensuring that local voices are heard here in Canberra as well. As a community, there's great excitement about a new stadium in Toowoomba. We're a growing city with a proud sporting legacy. Let's make sure we get this right.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McEwen</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:18</span>):  Last week was National Volunteer Week. I know that we can never actually quantify just how much value volunteers put into our communities, but we should acknowledge the amount of work that they do across our communities and across our region. Last week I spoke to many of the leaders of our great volunteer organisations to thank them for their work and let them know how our government is supporting them all the way through. These are organisations like Love in Action in Wallan, our Rotary and Lions Club groups, our men's sheds, Probus, SES, the Whittlesea Historical Society, the U3A in Kilmore, as well as the Lancefield Bowling Club, the Macedon Ranges and Mernda football and netball clubs, the Kilmore and Diamond Creek tennis clubs and many others. It's so important that we take the time to acknowledge these volunteers because each and every day they bring the fabric of our communities together by working together and doing the jobs that we need to keep these clubs going and keep our communities and families safe.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say to Shannan and Daniela, thank you for the invite to your wedding. It was such a magnificent evening to go to and see two beautiful young women get married. It was absolutely one of the best weddings we've been to. Their little baby, Charlotte, was the star of the show, let's be honest. She ran through and had a great time. To both Daniela and Shannan I say thank you for that opportunity to be there. It was a wonderful, wonderful evening. Thank you particularly for the candy you gave us at the end of the night—that really went down well. I wish you both happiness forever.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:20</span>):  Last week I had the chance to celebrate the contribution of 26 outstanding volunteers in Petrie who go above and beyond, and always show service over self at my volunteer awards. This event is an opportunity to highlight the unsung and often unseen heroes of society. It was, appropriately, held alongside National Volunteer Week. I thank the following organisations: Volunteering Queensland, Moreton Bay Region Industry &amp; Tourism, IKEA North Lakes, Tom's Confectionery Warehouse, Seasons IGA, Neli Coffee—who make great coffee—and not-for-profit Citipointe Church for the use of their building. Our guest for the morning tea was Mara Basanovic, CEO of Volunteering Queensland, who gave an uplifting and inspiring speech. The 26 awardees were: Amanda Latta, Marie Stuart, Candy Hunter, Margaret Noble, Megan Stuart, Kerrianne Sheppard, Ashley Broad, Bevan Dunlop, Bruce Hintz, Rhonda Brodie, Sue Kennard, Bill Heraghty, Olivia Solina, Laurie Day, Ros Smalley, Ashley Wearne, Lee Nuttall, Folola Coy, Daniel Hayes, Ken Hatchman, Bill Henderson, Lynette Stephan, Lynda Barry, Paul Barry, Robert Hoekzema, Patricia Spillman and Terri Baker. I have met a lot of volunteers across many different organisations, and your stories continually inspire me to represent you to the best of my ability.</span>

I congratulate Musgrove Realty on two awards they received at Rate My Agent's Agent of the Year Awards ceremony, held in Melbourne a couple months ago. Musgrove Realty is a family-owned real-estate agency based in Laguna, a great small town in the picturesque Wollombi Valley. The family-owned business is led by selling principal Garry Musgrove and his son, Kurt Musgrove, who are integral members of the Laguna community and surrounds.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Wollombi Valley is a beautiful, scenic part of my electorate that can easily be visited when travelling north of Sydney towards the Hunter, and I highly recommend that people make the trip. Small businesses like Musgrove Realty provide high-quality services that make the Hunter a great place to live. In recognition of the excellent service they provide to the community, Musgrove Realty received two awards. Firstly, Musgrove Realty was recognised as being in the top five per cent of real-estate agencies in Australia in terms of customer satisfaction. Secondly, Gary Musgrove was recognised as the top agent for Laguna. Congratulations to you, Garry and Kurt, and the whole team at Musgrove Realty. I thank you and all the hardworking small businesses across the Hunter for serving our community so well.</span>

It began in 2002 in memory of Matt, a serving policeman and avid sportsman who tragically passed away from cancer at the age of 28. His father, Garry, and several of Matt's friends established the charity golf day in memory of Matt, and have raised over $200,000 for the Cape Hawke Surf Life Saving Club and Great Lakes Palliative Care Support.

Well done to Bob Smith, the president of the history group, Mr Bruce Dun, and the Forestry Corporation of New South Wales. It's a wonderful asset for everyone to go and visit.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:24</span>):  I rise to congratulate the people of Timor-Leste on a peaceful parliamentary election on Sunday, the country's fifth parliamentary election since the restoration of their independence in 2002. Once again our neighbours demonstrated the maturity of their democratic institutions, and that is a very wonderful thing.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, at the restoration of their independence day celebrations, a number of Australians received orders of Timor-Leste, including Carmel Bates, who is a Territorian from Darwin who received a medal of Timor-Leste from President Jose Ramos-Horta 21 years after creating the Dili International School. The nation was less than a year old when the school's doors opened in early February 2003. It is a remarkable story. Carmel's family decided to move to Dili in 2002, but one of the major issues was education for Carmel's three kids with her partner, Tony Haritos. So they decided to start an international school. It has benefited countless young Timorese children as well as the children of international expats, including members of the Australian Defence Force and members of DFAT. I join the Timor-Leste President in thanking Carmel for her exemplary service.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Capricornia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:26</span>):  Graziers just a half-hour drive from Rockhampton are facing a David-and-Goliath battle against conglomerate renewable energy companies that are planning to destroy acres of untouched land that is a habitat for koalas, sugar gliders and the rare Northern Quoll. One development, the Moah wind farm project, has plans to cover over 10,000 hectares of remnant vegetation with wind turbines.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Glen Kelly and his family have been farming the land which backs on to under this project for six generations now. One of the turbines will be just 4.5 kilometres from their family home. Glen and his family understand the importance of farming to sustain and protect the land. They, and every other farmer in Queensland, adhere to the strict regulations enforced by the state government, which include tree-clearing guidelines, reef legislation and environmental protocols. Yet, unlike the farmers who are guardians of the environment they live and work on, these renewable energy companies don't have to meet any of these regulations. The sheer hypocrisy is astounding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister for the environment's need to hit his 82 per cent renewable target by 2032 is allowing these corporations to build their projects in completely inappropriate areas. The environmental damage that will be caused and the fact that the renewable companies do not have to meet any regulations, unlike other industries, is outrageous. The federal and state governments need to pause the push to rush to meet targets and take a step back to focus on the best way forward to make cheaper and cleaner power without the decimation of the environment.</span>

Appin Road is an essential link in my electorate that connects my electorate of Macarthur in the Illawarra to Wollondilly, Camden and Western Sydney airport. Appin Road is a single-lane road each way that carries massive traffic now. Areas of my electorate have doubled or nearly tripled in size since the 2016 census. We are now the biggest electorate by population in the country, yet the needs of my electorate are being ignored by governments of all persuasions.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would not be treating my constituents appropriately if I didn't raise this issue in federal parliament yet again. Appin Road is a road on which many people have died over the last 20 years. It has increasing traffic, with trucks from Wollongong port carrying cars, produce and coal moving along Appin Road. The road itself is very dangerous, yet it is not being treated appropriately by governments of all persuasions. It is vital for my electorate. It connects us to the Illawarra. It connects us to the north and to the Western Sydney airport and yet its needs are being ignored. The needs of my constituents are being ignored. It is urgent that infrastructure is put in place for Macarthur. Appin Road is a primary connector for all those areas and electorates in south-western Sydney, leading down to the Illawarra, and yet it is being ignored. This is a tragedy for the electorate of Macarthur. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:29</span>):  It's always dangerous to predict the future, but I'll give it a shot. I think in my lifetime women's AFL will be as big and successful, if not more so, than the men's game. I've seen an inkling of this in my own electorate while I watched the emergence of the Northwest Lightning Girls AFL Club. It's a club that cares about its players and has a winning culture. The club is the initiative of Pennant Hills, Westbrook and Hornsby Junior football clubs. In its inaugural season in 2016, it fielded an under-14s team. It's been growing ever since, with teams across five age groups.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The club has celebrated a wonderful milestone. Tara Coopman, known to everyone as TC, recently played her 100th game. I was there for the game and got to catch up with TC, a remarkable, competitive player who just loves AFL and her parents and her brother who are involved in the club. She is happiest when she is putting on a pair of boots and playing, which is practically every day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">TC is the first player in the club to complete 100 games. She has achieved this in over seven calendar years, but, because of COVID, she has effectively done this in five, which is, in itself, breathtaking. She's been with the local club since the under-9s and won awards every single year. This year, TC has been accepted to play in the Under-15 Youth Girls Sydney Swans Academy. I hope one day to see TC play at the G. TC is a wonderful athlete, nurtured by wonderful club and wonderful family. I want to congratulate TC and everyone at Northwest Lightning on this great achievement and the great success they're having mentoring and encouraging a great emerging talent and a great football club.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:31</span>):  Last week, the Minister for Defence Industries, the Hon. Pat Conroy, visited Bendigo to make a very important announcement, an announcement that will save and secure jobs at our Bendigo Thalis manufacturing facility. This is where we build the Australian Bushmasters. The announcement was $160 million to build a further 78 Bushmasters for the Australian Army. This is enormous. This will save and secure the jobs that we have at the site. The previous government left office without a plan and no contracts were ready to go. We have turned it around. We've secured the jobs at the site and ensured that there are future jobs for the next generations. We met some young apprentices there, one of whose father works at the site and great uncle worked at the site. For generations, people have been working at Bendigo Thalis. It is a site where we build the equipment that our army needs. The Bushmaster, as we know, saves Australian lives. It's a world-class vehicle. It is making a real difference in countries like Ukraine. It is being sold to countries like Japan and New Zealand, and we are hopeful for future export contracts, but the good news is we've got a contract to secure the jobs ongoing—78 Bushmasters, $160 million from our government to secure the jobs at the site. I'm so proud to be part of a government that puts defence manufacturing first and the jobs at Bendigo first.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:32</span>):  There have been some exciting things going on in Donnybrook in my electorate. Congratulations to Oakway Estate, located in Palmdale, which recently won Best Cellar Door Experience for WA at the Travel and Hospitality 2023 Oceania Awards. Winners were selected based on the aggregation of reviews from multiple third-party sources. There were over 300 nominations received. The estate is being run by three generations of the Hammond family. The property originally supported apple and stone fruit orchards, before its potential for producing premium wines was realised. The current owners are Wayne and Ria Hammond. Today, the 100-acre, or 40-hectare, property supports the winery, a cellar door, a vineyard, a blue gum plantation and a small herd of beef cattle.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also congratulations in Donnybrook go to Rowan, Merrin and the team at Donnybrook Pharmacy celebrating 10 years as part of that community. Their celebration included awarding one lucky customer a $200 gift card. There was also an amazing birthday cake and cupcakes. The team at the Donnybrook Pharmacy are now busy offering flu shots for their local community, as are most of our local pharmacies, to keep us all healthy over this period of winter. In a community that's based around farming and agriculture, known for its wonderful apples and pears, congratulations to each one of these worthy people.</span>

Last week was National Volunteer Week. I would like to thank the volunteers in my electorate for the amazing work that they do, not to mention a few of the organisations in my electorate whose volunteers make a huge difference to the lives of people in the community who are doing it tough.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Barb Baker runs Helping Hands based in Longford. Samantha Sayers runs a community pantry in the Derwent Valley and Theresa Temple is a house manager of Bridgewater Neighbourhood House. The thing they all have in common is they are providing food relief for families who need it most and for people doing it tough. Some also offer donated household items to those who need them most. People like Barb, Theresa, Samantha and the volunteers of these organisations can be somebody's last hope, a touch of positivity and kindness for people in a dark time. They make a real difference to people's lives. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to mention the incredible volunteers who put together AgFest Rural Youth; the volunteers who put together the Derwent Valley Autumn Festival—a raging success in the last few weeks; the Lachlan Fire Brigade; the Sheffield SteamFest; and of course the footy volunteers, who, week-in, week-out, are in the kitchens, manning the grounds, doing the umpiring. Volunteers—where would we be without you?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:35</span>):  Yesterday at the memorial service on the occasion of the 78th anniversary of the Kapooka tragedy, I witnessed, as did the others who were lucky enough to be present, one of the most inspirational scenes ever. Alan Evans got out of his wheelchair as his daughter Suzanne Christmas laid the wreath at the plinth. He struggled to get out of the chair but get out of the chair he did. He gave the salute. It was absolutely uplifting. It was truly remarkable. Here is a man who in one month's time will be 93 who served the regular Army from 1959 to 1980, who has given this nation his all. Yet despite the fact that only last week he was released from Wagga Wagga Base Hospital after a three-week stint from a heart attack and pneumonia, he still found the energy, he summoned the pluck, to stand and salute. The Kapooka tragedy: 26 lives lost—26 souls—the worst training accident in Australia's history. We pay honour to them. We say 'lest we forget', but I also pay tribute to Alan Evans, whose wife of 62 years, Nancy, was beside him. It truly was inspirational, and may he live to see many more services throughout the Riverina.</span>

I've seen in my portfolio in mental health young women struggling quite significantly. This brings me to one young woman in my community, Emily Smith. I met her at the 35th anniversary of Emu Plains Lions Club. She was presented with a very special 100-year celebration coin for her dedication to our community and, in particular, work that she has done in youth mental health. She is a young woman who has gone through her own mental health struggles, and in my conversations with her we've talked about the significant impacts on young people during COVID.</span>

Young people play such an important role in all our electorates. But for today I would like to congratulate Emily. I was in awe of the work she's done and every conversation with her. I'm just really proud that she's a young woman in my community of Lindsay.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:40</span>):  If ever there was the perfect example of community coming together, it was on full show at the Blessing of the Fleet Festival at Ulladulla on Easter Sunday. The Blessing the Fleet Parade, made up of a record number of colourfully and intricately designed floats, with Blessing of the Fleet Princesses, made its way down the highway at Ulladulla. Thousands of people came out to watch the parade and participate in the festival. There were 81 community and market stalls. There was the popular greasy pole competition, tug-of-war and more. There was the traditional Blessing of the Fleet Catholic church service by the harbour, and the most amazing actual Blessing of the Fleet, where we hopped on a Marine Rescue Ulladulla boat and Father Michael Dyer, together with Uncle Phil Butler, went across the water to each boat to bless the boat and its fishers for a plentiful catch and a safe return.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 1956 the festival has been a long-held tradition of this Italian Ulladulla fishing community and something to be immensely proud of. The Ulladulla Blessing of the Fleet Princess Ball provides an opportunity for young women and their partners to participate in their community, to learn to dance and to co-ordinate their own float. Huge thanks go to the Blessing of the Fleet Organising Committee, to the Rotary Club of Milton-Ulladulla, to the Ulladulla fishing community and to the many sponsors, service clubs, local businesses and community groups that make this event so special. I cannot wait for next year's event.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:41</span>):  Almost one month ago across the country and across Casey we gathered to commemorate Anzac Day. I want to take a moment to, firstly, acknowledge the Monbulk RSL, who are struggling at the moment after recently losing their president, Bill Ford. I had the opportunity to attend Bill's service on Friday. It was an amazing turnout of the Monbulk community. Craig and John from the RSL spoke so well about what Bill meant to their community. His sons did him a fitting tribute. Bill and his wife, Sue, were married at that RSL, and it was really a fitting tribute to him on Friday. It was an honour to be able to be there to pay my respects to Bill. So I want to thank the Monbulk RSL. I was fortunate to be there on Anzac Day, when Bill delivered that whole service with no notes, off the top of his head. It was a great tribute. I also want to thank the Lilydale, Mount Evelyn, Wandin, Dandenong Ranges and Mooroolbark communities for their commemorations that I was able to attend on the day. It was wonderful to see so many people out remembering such an important day in our calendar. And I want to thank the Healesville, Kalorama, Montrose, Millgrove, Seville, Upper Yarra, Upwey/Belgrave, Warburton and Yarra Glen communities, who all held events on the day as well—an amazing commemoration of such an important day in our calendar, not just in my community of Casey but across the country.</span>

The Newcastle Youth Forum was attended by young people aged 16 to 24 from across Newcastle and the Hunter region and provided an opportunity for participants to communicate directly with the minister about their priorities and the issues that impact most on them and their peers. Attendees were particularly asked to highlight the priorities for young people in our region and brainstorm how they would tackle these issues—and they certainly delivered. The young attendees spoke passionately about a diverse range of matters, including housing affordability, mental health, climate change, support for live music, youth safety, and cost-of-living measures. They also shared their diverse lived experiences and proposed some very creative solutions to the social and policy challenges that we confront each day.</span>

The youth of today are our future, which is why it is so critical that they are part of the conversation. As a government we are working hard to continue these conversations with young people across the country, to hear their ideas and listen to their personal experiences. I'd like to express my sincere gratitude to all the young people who attended the Newcastle Youth Forum for their passion, determination and creative thinking.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to be moving this motion today, and I am proud of the Albanese government's commitment to our national parks. In the Territory, we are blessed with a truly stunning natural landscape. From the saltwater and rainforest of the north to the deserts of the centre, we have some of the most beautiful country in the world. Our natural environment and our national parks attract tens of thousands of tourists each year, building the Territory's economy, fuelling business and providing employment.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">For many Territorians, our national parks are also places of deep cultural importance. Ancient rock art at Ubirr and Uluru speak to this. For tens of thousands of years Aboriginal people have protected and nurtured our environment. Today this legacy continues with the Indigenous ranger program and thousands of Aboriginal people looking after country in the Territory.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For our national parks this funding is an absolute lifeline. For the last decade, the former government simply could not manage our national parks. The fiasco that was the Morrison government's $260 million Kakadu funding is a testament to this. For three years, the previous government sat on that money, with very little reaching the ground.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally we have a government that gets our national parks. Since we have been in government we have tripled the amount of money reaching frontline organisations in Kakadu. I know Minister Plibersek and her team have had long conversations with Kakadu traditional owners and national parks as well as other stakeholders about how we can get that particularly special part of the world back on track. I am very eager to see Kakadu get the support and investment it so desperately deserves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are committed to investing in our natural landscapes and improving working conditions for our rangers. Currently, infrastructure in our national parks is in a state of disrepair. But the Albanese Labor government is rolling out an ambitions body of work to bring this up to standard. The Albanese government's investment will go towards addressing critical infrastructure, including updating unsafe equipment, fixing inadequate signage, providing essential ranger housing and refurbishing rundown facilities, such as the Kakadu Aboriginal cultural centre. This will boost conservation activities and cultural heritage management. We aren't just paying lip service to the importance of our parks; we are putting our money where our mouth is. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This investment will also create 110 new jobs, including new roles for traditional owners to work on country and new positions to ensure safety and deliver major projects. I have seen the impact of Indigenous rangers firsthand. Before I came to parliament, I worked alongside hundreds of Indigenous rangers through the Northern Land Council. The work our rangers undertake on a daily basis is not only grounded in cultural knowledge; it is also a meaningful employment pathway for many of our young people out bush. The Albanese government gets this and understands this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For Lingiari, the additional traditional owner rangers and the $262 million plan more broadly will have huge socioeconomic as well as environmental outcomes. I am lucky to have parks of natural significance in my electorate, including Kakadu, Litchfield, Uluru-Kata Tjuta, Finke Gorge, Nitmiluk, Tjoritja, or the West MacDonnell Ranges, and Watarrka, to name but a few. I want to send out a special thanks to Minister Plibersek for all of the work that she has done on this. It is refreshing to have a minister for the environment that actually cares about the environment, talks the talk and actually does the work that is required.</span>

                  </a>  Well, they're federal parks, sure, but you've still got to manage. You've still got to be able to be there when it counts, and the successive Labor governments in the Northern Territory have not done that. But let's talk federally. Let's go to what has been done in this portfolio. The member for Lingiari talks about environmental protection and about national parks. We all want our national parks to be the best they can be. What we don't want to see is our national parks locked up—that would be the Greens' way—and then be open to pests and open to absolute destruction. But, in this portfolio, we have seen $178 million of cuts to environmental protection measures from the figures shown in Budget Paper No. 1. There's also a $407 million shortfall between the forecast spending and actual spending on environmental protection for 2022-23.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would not normally quote organisations such as the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Wilderness Society, WWF Australia and the Australian Land Conservation Alliance, but they have absolutely savaged the handling of the budget in this particular area. There have been absolutely staggering delays from the Minister for the Environment and Water, the member for Sydney, and her office in answer to pleas for information and certainty about whether or not some groups are going to get funding. I know that this is the day when those opposite are going to come in here and spruik their 12 months of delivery. I know it's the day when they're going to be patting themselves on the back having been in government for a year.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition welcomes this motion from the member for Lingiari. I know she comes here with good faith. I know that she's coming here to work hard for her constituents. I'm pleased that she's actually in this place because, but for me and but for the hard work and advocacy of others to keep the seat of Lingiari in the federal parliament, there would not be a seat of Lingiari. Regional people deserve representation, and I don't care whether that representation is a Labor member or whoever—as long as it's not the Greens—but we want to see regional people represented, and, as I say, we want to see our national parks be the best they can be.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank you for bringing this motion forward. I represented Kosciuszko from 2010 to 2016 until there was a redistribution, and I know how important national parks are. Indeed, a previous National Party leader and iconic figure, Tim Fischer—the late great Tim Fischer AC—started off the Tumbatrek. It should have actually been called the 'Tim-batrek', because it was Tim's baby. He came up with the idea to promote tourism and promote national parks and to promote the balance of visitation of national parks with the need to conserve and protect the environments of these unique wilderness spots within Australia. Certainly Tumbatrek has been going for many, many years. I revived it back in 2011. I'm glad that I did, and now the member for Eden-Monaro carries the long staff that Tim trekked with. I know that the Labor Party's talking points say 'a decade of neglect and misery' et cetera but, in 2019-20 alone, we devoted $216 million to Kakadu alone and another $233 million to other national parks. We cared. We delivered. It's time Labor just had a little bit of a look back at the real history of what we did in the coalition, during the Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison years to protect the environment, to enhance those unique wildlife areas and to make sure that we did everything we could—and we did!—to ensure that they were protected for future generations.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:54</span>):  We are a government that values and protects our environment, and that is why I am pleased to rise to speak in support of this motion by the member for Lingiari. The Albanese Labor government has committed an extra $262.3 million in the 2023 budget to address the chronic underfunding of Australia's iconic national parks. This is additional funding on top of the existing parks funding. The $262.3 million covers some of our most precious places, including Booderee National Park and the World Heritage listed Kakadu and Uluru-Kata Tjuta national parks. It also includes Christmas Island National Park, Pulu Keeling National Park, Norfolk Island National Park and a network of 60 Australian marine parks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to act because the scale of the mismanagement and neglect that took place under the previous government cannot be understated. Sadly, that mismanagement left our national parks with broken infrastructure, out-of-date equipment and inadequate facilities. Without sufficient funding, important work like protecting threatened species is adversely affected, and the tourism industries that local economies rely on are not supported. This compromises the ability to protect some of our most precious places and the plants and animals that call them home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government will also invest $163.4 million to save the Australian Institute of Marine Science, which, through a dedicated team of marine scientists, helps us to protect the Great Barrier Reef. Again, after years of underfunding by the previous government, they were left with mouldy ceilings and out-of-date laboratories, and with their jobs at risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The additional $262.3 million in funding for our national parks is a vitally important investment to make sure that we manage nature better. These environments requires staff and tourism businesses to operate, which means that funding and protecting them is also good for our economy. Under this new funding, 110 new jobs will be created, including new roles for traditional owners to work on country. The Albanese Labor government's investment will boost cultural heritage management and conservation activities; address critical infrastructure needs, including updating unsafe equipment, providing ranger housing and refurbishing rundown facilities like the Kakadu Aboriginal cultural centre; and support important programs such as the new National Seed Bank at the Australian National Botanic Gardens. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must better protect our precious places, and better support those who manage them, to ensure that they can be enjoyed for generations to come. As a government we want to be sure that we are leaving our environment in a sound state for our children and our grandchildren. This is important to me as a parent and as a grandparent. I love our natural environment, as do many of you here, like many people in my electorate of Pearce in Western Australia, where we have some stunning bushlands, national and regional parks and coastline. It's very important. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As an ambassador for the Western Australia Parks Foundation, appointed by former governor Kerry Sanderson, I promote and raise awareness of our natural environment, particularly our national parks. Pearce has many beautiful bushland areas and more than 30 kilometres of stunning coastline. We have the Yellagonga Regional Park, the Yanchep National Park and others that I know are highly valued by our community and by visitors. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is investing more in our parks, which is in stark contrast to the previous government. In 2019 the Liberals and Nationals promised $276 million in funding for Kakadu, yet they delivered just a fraction of that—$17 million. As at 31 March 2023, Labor had delivered $50.31 million and also contracted another $2.96 million. We have already delivered important infrastructure, and, importantly, we are consulting with traditional owners to advance new tourism developments. We value our natural environments and we want to protect them now and into the future. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It hasn't been easy since Labor was elected. Yesterday, 21 May, marked the first-year anniversary of Labor coming into government. Families and small businesses are feeling the pinch now more than ever. Spiralling costs in energy, workforce shortages and the supply chain crisis are pushing businesses to the brink.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In last week's budget, the government wasted an opportunity to home in on the issues directly affecting business and middle Australia. Australians waited with bated breath in hope of some relief from the cost-of-living pressures. Millions of Australians were left disappointed with a budget that will spend an additional $185 billion while middle-income Australians won't receive any relief from the strain they're under. During a housing crisis, Labor plans to increase migration by 1.5 million people by 2027. That's more than nine times the population of my electorate of Capricornia. With Queensland's vacancy rate sitting at an extremely tight 0.9 per cent in the first quarter of this year, even more families will be forced onto the street to sleep in their cars or tents. New data released by the Housing Industry Association last Thursday has revealed construction of new dwellings has slowed significantly. The great Australian dream of owning your own home is quickly turning into a nightmare as young Australians wake up to the realisation that they may never have the opportunity to own their home under a Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government's policies are causing inflation to stay higher for longer, continuing to put pressure on interest rates. Our core inflation is now higher than every other major advanced economy. There have been no fewer than 10 interest rate rises under this government. It's not just the housing and rental crisis that's also feeling the pinch; energy prices have never been higher since the Labor government was elected a year ago. Electricity prices are skyrocketing and are expected to go up by more than $500. The Albanese government has failed to deliver on its promised electricity price relief—a promise the Prime Minister mentioned 97 times on his campaign trail. Those opposite only have a plan for meeting climate targets, not ensuring our energy remains reliable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These targets in the establishment of renewable energy projects are going to hit the hip pocket of the everyday Australian. To meet the minister for the environment's 82 per cent renewable energy target by 2032 will require 22,000 solar panels to be installed every day and 40 wind turbines to be erected every month between now and 2030. To distribute this renewable energy, more than $100 billion needs to be spent on the 28,000 kilometres of transmission lines. These poles and lines will run through prime farming land, pristine national parks and suburbs right across the country. The sites for these projects are completely inappropriate. This is going to be hugely detrimental to the environment and also to the budgets of families and businesses as costs to achieve this renewable energy push will be passed on to the consumer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Reckless policy interventions into the energy market have stalled gas supplies, bringing with that skyrocketing prices impacting every aspect of production. This is adding to the costs along supply chain from the producer to the checkout. The manufacturing industry is one of the biggest consumers of energy in the country. High-energy-using businesses are going to be slapped with substantial hikes in power prices. Two hundred and twelve of Australia's largest manufacturing businesses will be hit with Labor's safeguard mechanism carbon tax, putting more jobs at risk through a poor piece of climate change policy aimed at punishing the engine room of our economy. The very businesses who brought this government a $4 billion surplus are being punished. Labor has no plan for improving this industry to allow for the growth of jobs and the economy in the manufacturing sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite promising over and over again that their National Reconstruction Fund would reinvigorate manufacturing in Australia, there was next to nothing in the budget to roll out this program. A year has been lost for manufacturers while this government delays crucial support for the industry. Labor halted the Modern Manufacturing Initiative, aimed at supporting and growing the industry. Not one cent has been delivered through the National Reconstruction Fund to date. Under the former Rudd-Gillard Labor government, manufacturing contribution to GDP fell by $7 billion, and 6,800 manufacturing businesses closed their doors. It seems that, under the Albanese government, the manufacturing industry is set to go the same way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government must address the critical issues affecting the manufacturing sector through policies that create strong economic conditions. This past year has formed the question: are we better off now under a Labor government than we were 12 months ago?</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:04</span>):  I must say, the second-worst part of budget week has definitely got to be the fact that no private members' business was scheduled, as the House didn't meet on Monday. The worst part, of course, is listening to the hollow pontification of the Leader of the Opposition's budget reply speech. But my remarks on that are best saved for another time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I'm joining my colleagues—fellow members of the class of '22—the member for Swan and the member for Hunter in speaking against the motion by the member for Capricornia. For what it's worth, we should remind the House that this is a motion moved by the shadow assistant minister for manufacturing. Manufacturing is immensely important to me as well. It's important to Spence. It is the industry that was positioned around the establishment and growth of Adelaide's northern suburbs. Spence has the seventh-highest percentage of manufacturing business within it—manufacturing for a vast number of industries, from defence to clean energy. But what Spence doesn't manufacture en masse anymore, like we used to, is cars, and we again have those opposite to thank for that. By virtue of the shadow assistant ministry held by the member for Capricornia, one would of course expect to see a voluminous motion—a treatise, if you will—explaining the coalition's policies when it comes to manufacturing, to energy, to interest rates and to Labor's supply shortages. Alas, this is certainly not an opposition with a plan—not a positive policy in sight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have here instead is an opposition of 100 negative hollow statements, begging questions which serve as a subtext for the ultimate question: when are the worst days of opposition finally going to be behind them? Not today. It will be when those opposite can finally divorce themselves from the record of their former government—not just the Abbott years but the Turnbull years, and let's not forget the Morrison years, too, although we should not forget them entirely, lest we are doomed to repeat them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion moved by the member for Capricornia sets itself out to be either coyly naive or legitimately oblivious of what the Albanese Labor government has done in this past year to move our country forward in this space. As with a breakfast at an inner-city cafe, I shall be attempting to deconstruct the motion by the member for Capricornia as I plate it up for the Chamber on this fine evening. Those opposite are making an audacious leap in logic by attempting to contend that the government has no plans to combat any of the issues faced by a number of manufacturers which have been listed in the motion. Whether it be power prices, labour shortages or disruptions to supply chains, I can vividly recall the member for Capricornia voting against the Albanese Labor government's energy plan, voting against the safeguard mechanism, and voting against the Jobs and Skills Australia Amendment Bill, just a short time ago. Yet the member for Capricornia attempts to say that the government has no plans. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member's motion moves on to the National Reconstruction Fund—don't even get me started. This is another piece of legislation that the member and those opposite voted against. In fact, the NRF passed in spite of the member for Capricornia, in spite of the member for Hinkler and in spite of the member for McMillan. As the record reflects, the National Reconstruction Fund Bill received assent on the 11 April this year. On 9 May, what did we get from the member the Capricornia? We got a motion pondering why the fund has not yet issued a single dollar to manufacturers. Am I surprised by this? Absolutely not. I'm not even slightly surprised by this stance, as those opposite are scions of a former government renowned for its colour-coded spreadsheets. That's why I'm not surprised about their air of confusion about why an independent Commonwealth corporate entity that is not yet a month old in the statute books hasn't started financing projects. But of course, as the member's motion notes, if it had done so, she has severe reservations as to the inflationary effect that any funding would cause—just as an aside.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That mindset is just part and parcel of the former government's reluctance to support manufacturing in Australia. It seriously took a once-in-a-generation—hopefully—pandemic for those opposite to think to themselves, 'Oh golly: maybe it might be a good idea if we made things here in Australia again' and start to unwind the damage they've caused to the industry. One of the most important elements of good government is having a good opposition, and all I can say to the member for Capricornia, to those opposite, is: do better.</span>

                  <a href="148150" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PITT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:09</span>):  I'm about to give you a hot tip, Madam Deputy Speaker Chesters. No matter who is in government, whether it's Labor or whether it's the coalition, and no matter what the situation is—whether it's a hung parliament or whether there are difficulties in the Senate—the fundamentals of business simply do not change. They don't change. It doesn't matter whether you are in manufacturing, agriculture, resources or anything else, the fundamentals are these: confidence—that is everything; affordable electricity and gas; affordable and reliable energy; the ability to actually secure critical staff that you need to make your business run; and a willingness to put your house on the line and risk everything to be in small business, make a difference and actually deliver something.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now this Labor government is destroying every single section that is needed for business to be successful. They have intervened in the electricity market. I've never seen anything like this. It is quite extraordinary. There is a cap on gas prices. There is a cap on people who have invested tens of billions of dollars in this country to develop an industry that simply didn't exist, and the Labor government has moved the goalposts. Not only has it moved them; it has thrown them into the ocean. You have the Japanese ambassador saying that in Australia there is now sovereign risk for investment. That is absolutely unheard of. We saw in media reports in the last 24 hours that the Prime Minister had to meet with the Japanese Prime Minister to try to ensure that Japan were confident that our resources would continue to flow under the existing contracts that they've had for decades. For decades in this country, they have been delivering jobs and investments for Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout the COVID period we managed to ensure that the reputation of this country continued as a reliable supplier for energy and resources for places like Japan. Without Australia's coal, energy and gas, they would've closed down. It would've been absolute anarchy. It is the same in South Korea and a lot of our other key markets. If you want to have manufacturing in this country, then, quite simply, these are the things that matter. Who in their right mind will invest in this country, knowing that a Labor government will pull the rug out from under them after they've invested, after they've put significant money on the line, after they've come to this nation and actually built an industry that we need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have seen is the Minister for the Environment and Water knock out two coalmines and then celebrate. Admittedly, one was approved in the last seven days, but it's one which is for coking coal, and you do need to make steel. That's a fundamental if you want to be in manufacturing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we see are interventions around gas prices and electricity prices, and we see moving policies. All of these things absolutely destroy confidence. Then comes the safeguard mechanism, another job-destroying policy from this Labor government for which there is no real solution. If you are an industry in the top 200, how on earth do you offset your carbon emissions for an existing facility if you cannot invest to make any changes? There was a report from the CSIRO late in the year last year which outlined very clearly what the existing protocols could potentially deliver inside offsets for carbon farming. You could shift 100 million hectares of Australian agriculture and you wouldn't touch the sides of what is required by the safeguard mechanism under this Labor government. There's only 420 million hectares, and guess what? It produces food. Now, we kind of need food. We are a big exporter. Some $70 billion to $80 billion is the target I'd expect this year for agricultural exports. It is absolutely essential not only to Australia's productivity; it's also part of our psyche. We're an agricultural country. The idea that you would shift hundreds of millions of hectares of ag production to carbon offsets and let them go to weeds and feral pigs and dogs and have no employment is the absolute opposite of what a government should be doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You cannot simply wander around telling international investors that these policies are fantastic, that they're the greatest thing since sliced bread, but that they can't actually be delivered. The only way that the CSIRO identified that had any potential was carbon capture and storage, and guess what? The federal Labor government has rubbed that out. That's not something that Minister Bowen wants to support, yet it could produce gigatonnes of storage, according to the CSIRO. That actually works. Imagine that—a policy that works! So what we continue to see when it comes to manufacturing is a tax on confidence. It's a tax on policy stability. It's a tax on the ability to invest and actually secure funding. These are all the things that every business needs to be successful—in fact, to start and to survive and to remain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, the people to whom I talk may well want to be out there employing more people, but they simply do not have the confidence to do that, and under this Labor government I expect that will continue, because they cannot pay their bills, particularly their power bills.</span>

                  <a href="298840" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr REPACHOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:14</span>):  I rise today to speak on the very important topic of manufacturing. Right now it is tough for a lot of Aussies. Interest rates continue to go up, the cost of living is continuing to get higher, and these same pressures are making things difficult for our manufacturing sector too. A strong Australia needs a strong manufacturing sector. It is no secret that our manufacturing sector is not as strong as it once was. The Hunter knows this well. Just up the road in Newcastle is one of the biggest steel manufacturing plants in the country, the BHP steelworks. This gave jobs to many people in my electorate. It closed in 1999, and who was the government then? Those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like me, those who worked in the car manufacturing industry also know all too well the struggle of manufacturing in this country. It does not take a genius to figure out who was in government when the last car manufacturer in this country closed down. That is right; it was those opposite—again. There appears to be a pattern here. Whenever the decline of manufacturing sector is o brought up, those opposite are associated with it. They then have the tenacity to stand in this place and make pathetic and untrue claims that this government is doing nothing to help the manufacturing sector. Well, it may be difficult to rebuild the manufacturing sector as quickly as those opposite knocked it down, but we will certainly try.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government who passed a $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund, and those on the other side of the Chamber—the no-alition—unsurprisingly, as they always do, said no. So do not claim that you care about manufacturing when you oppose a multibillion-dollar fund aimed at building manufacturing again in this country. Those opposite would rather oppose for opposition's sake and see manufacturing continue to decline than vote with the government, because it might mean admitting that we are doing something right. That is childish, playground like behaviour but, luckily, the adults are now in government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate of the Hunter has always been a powerhouse for our state and it is this government that is making sure that my electorate will remain a powerhouse of New South Wales for decades to come. Ten long years of insecurity and indecisions on energy policy cast some doubt on the future of power generation in the Hunter. But this Labor government is making sure that jobs in the energy sector are created right where they should be—in the place that has always kept the lights on for New South Wales—the mighty Hunter. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Reconstruction Fund is making this possible. Just in case you have forgotten, those who you can probably hear having a whinge oppose this. If they had their way, energy generation in the Hunter would be making zero progress, stuck the behind indecision and ideological roadblocks. But the fund will provide opportunities for Australians, especially the Hunter, in a broad range of areas. This fund will help our resources sector, a sector I am proud to champion and a sector which the Hunter region was built on. Because of this fund, manufacturing is already looking at coming to the Hunter with Energy Renaissance building their first gigawatt factory just outside the Hunter, making our region home to lithium ion battery manufacture. This is just the beginning. This fund will create opportunities in the forestry and fisheries sector, the transport sector, medical science, renewables, low-emissions technology and also in defence. No matter where your skill set lies, job opportunities will be created for you and underpinning every single one of those sectors is manufacturing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know things are tough for Australians and we know that this does not make it easy for our manufacturers. But despite what is being said by those opposite, we are getting on with the job of creating jobs and helping to encourage manufacturing in this country. We passed the National Reconstruction Fund, and I have no doubt that this fund will be pivotal in reconstructing our nation and all that has crumbled underneath the previous government, especially in the manufacturing sector. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion is nothing other than a political play by a desperate opposition, who are trying to distract from the fact that the reason we need a reconstruction fund is because of their lazy attempt to govern this country.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BROADBENT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:19</span>):  I have had a bit of a giggle around what has been proposed today by the government. The member for Kennedy and I have been around for long enough to know that the issues around manufacturing and the policies around manufacturing have been a contest for every government that has come to power. And mostly, as the member for Kennedy knows, for a lot of our manufacturing we try to get governments involved in to push in one direction or push in another direction. I was here for the Button plan all those years ago. That was meant to work on behalf of the car manufacturers, but we were being pushed by what was happening around the world, not by what was happening here in Australia. We can fund aluminium production in western Victoria, but it's at a huge cost to the Victorian government and a huge cost to taxpayers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't know whether we chase manufacturing like that, but it does create jobs within communities and it does give opportunities for people to have a lifestyle they wouldn't otherwise have. But, importantly, we know that it doesn't matter how governments come along and push and shape and pull, the great tragedy—and I would agree with one of the members who mentioned this a minute ago—is that we lost our car industry, especially when I know that the Germans subsidise their car industry at a much higher level than we ever did. There's a difference though. They own their car industry. They are German manufacturers. They are German companies. Ours were a Japanese company in Nissan, a Japanese company in Toyota, an American company and—you're all too young to remember this—English companies in Leyland and Austin and all of those who went before them. I know these things. I love cars. I'm interested in cars. I'm interested in manufacturing in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand what the member for Hinkler said when he said, 'You can't have manufacturing unless you have really competitive energy prices,' which is exactly what Victoria was built on all those years ago. It was built on the power that came out of part of my electorate in La Trobe Valley. It powered a nation under the Bolte government and was the largest manufacturing sector in Australia in Victoria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The world changed that. We didn't change that. The manufacturing of footwear and clothing moved from this country to another, because they did it so much cheaper than we did. The Japanese started to produce fabrics and we were unable to compete with them here. The Egyptians started to produce wool that we weren't able to competitively do here. All of a sudden, your lambswool jumpers that were made in Australia were too dear; they could be imported for half the price. So our own retailers and wholesalers went straight to the Chinese and said, 'You do this for us,' to the Japanese, 'You do this for us,' to the Egyptians and the English, 'You do this for us.' The English were having their tweeds made in Egypt! I have proof of this, because I was there—as I was watching it go through the machines in Egypt, it had 'Made in England' written on the side of the fabric! So we think we're buying something that's literally woven and manufactured in England, and we're getting the opposite—we're getting something that's done in Egypt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We now live in a world where the input into manufacturing goods and services comes from all over the world. It doesn't come from just one spot. There was a great food manufacturer named Heinz in my community, and I said to them: 'Where do you source all this? Do you source all this cheese locally?' They said, 'No, that came from Belgium, and that came from—' wherever they can get it the cheapest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to you: be considerate and don't go back to every government for the last 10 years and say you were the worst government in history when it came to manufacturing, because that's just not the truth. Every government that I've seen in power in this country wants the jobs and opportunities that are presented by manufacturing here in Australia. I want to see the government succeed in manufacturing so there are jobs on the ground for people, there are opportunities to educate their children and there are opportunities for those who worked in manufacturing for a long time to grow old gracefully.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:24</span>):  Thank you to the member for Monash. I agree with you that we need to support manufacturing, and the best way that that could happen is by supporting the National Reconstruction Fund, so I urge you to support it in the House. I also thank the member for Capricornia for giving me another opportunity to talk about the Albanese Labor government's record on supporting Australian manufacturing. I'm particularly proud to speak about this as an engineer that has worked in industry. I note that I'm speaking after the member for Hunter, who is a metalworker trained as a toolmaker and is a fitter and turner. This government has committed $15 billion towards the establishment of a National Reconstruction Fund. This includes $61 million this financial year to support the establishment and oversight of the fund. This is the biggest investment in Australian manufacturing since World War II. This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Contained within this investment is $3 billion for renewables and low-emissions technology. The thing that I would highlight from our energy perspective is that the lowest unit cost of energy that we have in Australia at the moment is renewable energy. This is something that this government understands. The $3 billion for renewables and low-emission technology includes areas like clean-energy component manufacturing and technologies that improve energy efficiency. This will help to deliver more affordable, reliable and increasingly clean energy to Australian industry over the long term.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian industry wants energy market certainty and support in its transition towards a clean renewable energy economy. Under the previous government there were 30 attempts at an energy policy and not one was put into action effectively. So if the member for Capricornia wants to talk about supporting manufacturing, she should look at the last decade to see what the government had a handbrake on. Our government are being deliberate and considerate in the rollout of this landmark policy. Rushing money out without due diligence is how we ended up with sport rorts. It's how we ended up with the Badgerys Creek airport fiasco, where the Commonwealth paid an astounding $29.8 million for land that was valued at $3 million. Rushing major policy for political gain is how we ended up with colour-coded spreadsheets under the previous government. We're working with urgency, but we are also talking about $15 billion of taxpayer dollars. This is why we're also working with industry, communities and workers to make sure that we get the National Reconstruction Fund right—and industry is appreciative. Let me quote from the Australian Aluminium Council:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The key pathway to enabling new economy industries will be to leverage the capability in the regions of our existing industry. A circular economy and domestic focus for industry policy will maximise the value of these new industries.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The NRF is one part of the solution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has a vision for industry. We also have a vision for good, forward-thinking, well-paid, blue-collar jobs in Australia. This vision will also provide our country with the sovereign capability necessary to insulate against supply shocks. We also talk about inflation, which right now is a global issue, and we can see that it has been caused by external supply shocks resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This is not something this government shies away from, and we know that this is a confronting issue for households, businesses and industry. We knew that, under the previous government, when inflation jumped up by 2.1 per cent in the March 2022 quarter, this was the greatest increase in inflation in decades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I know that investing in Australian domestic manufacturing capacity is deflationary. It's about improving productivity and it means that, should a dictator decide to illegally invade their neighbour, the impact this has on prices will be reduced. Productivity is really important, and the truth is that, under the previous government, productivity of the economy was not looked at. If there had been foresight by the previous government on energy and manufacturing, the pain that household businesses and industries are feeling today would have been reduced. Instead, they got announcements without substance from—was it nine or 11 industry ministers? I cannot remember.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an absolute delight to stand in the Chamber this evening to note the changes to the trans-Tasman relationship. There's been a close relationship between Australia and New Zealand dating back decades, obviously, but in my community our government's recent announcement that, from 1 July 2023, New Zealand citizens living in Australia will have a direct pathway to Australian citizenship is something we are all celebrating. Australia and New Zealand have a deep friendship, a special bond which has been forged through our history, shared values and common outlook, and this year marks the 50th anniversary of the trans-Tasman travel arrangement, which brought Australia and New Zealand closer together by easing travel requirements between the two countries. It recognised the special bond we share.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">New Zealanders in my community chose to come to Australia and raise their families. They're working and building their lives in Australia. Many have lived most of their lives in Australia. I know; I've taught their children. For over 30 years I have taught Kiwi kids in schools in my electorate, and I am absolutely celebrating this decision of our government—a government that has taken the steps to ensure that aspiration can exist inside Pacific Islander homes in my community, that children won't be locked out of higher education on the back of being unable to secure Australian citizenship, with families faced with the choice of sending children back to NZ for university, away from their siblings and families, their cousins and their community. This is an absolutely seminal moment of change for my community. They are absolutely thrilled at the prospect that they could do this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to share this with the Chamber. The member for Kennedy might be interested. Young Anya was a Julia Gillard Award recipient when she was in grade 6, and last year I met her at the end-of-school graduation ceremony at one of my local schools. She was school captain. I said to her, 'What are you planning next year?' She said, 'I'd love to go to Melbourne university, but I'm a Kiwi, so it might be really difficult.' I met with her parents a week later and said, 'Look; my office is going to look into any kind of scholarships we can find for Melbourne university that would allow your daughter to go.' The father looked at me and said to me: 'We knew that this was coming. We knew she was bright. She's our oldest. We knew she was headed somewhere special. We even looked at sending her home to NZ, but, Joanne, when push came to shove, I couldn't put her on a plane. I couldn't have her leave me. I couldn't have her leave her mother. I couldn't have her leave her siblings. And so we've stayed and we've taken the chance. We've saved and we've saved and we've saved, and we're hoping that she can go to university next year.' I met with her this week. No-one's more excited about the fact that, on 1 July, she can apply for Australian citizenship and she will be able to get HECS, which will ensure the fact that she can stay. She's going to make a great contribution to this country. Her parents have made a great contribution to this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Who can forget the reason we're celebrating so loudly? We go to the dawn service in my community locally and we sing both the Australian and the New Zealand national anthems, and our New Zealanders attend that dawn service every year because they know this shared history. During the pandemic, they were pretty much told by the previous government that they could return to New Zealand. No support was put on the ground. Families in my community were setting up pantries on the front lawn to feed one another—families whose only income during the pandemic was their 17-year-old or 16-year-old child working at McDonald's, because the adults didn't have work to go to. Those families did it tough in the pandemic. I can't think of a better way to celebrate than giving them the opportunity to become Australian citizens where they choose to take it up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to what I know will be thousands of people in my community who will become great new Australian citizens given this opportunity by government. I can't imagine why it's taken 50 years. I will never understand why John Howard made it more difficult for New Zealanders to become Australian citizens. It never made sense. This government has undone it, and my community, for one, is celebrating.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WALLACE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:34</span>):  For someone who's so happy, she seems to be very unhappy and very angry. But, anyway, I digress. The government announced the changes to the visa arrangements for New Zealand citizens on 22 April. The coalition welcomes New Zealand citizens who have lived in Australia, contributed to our country, are of good character and want to become an Australian. Australia and New Zealand are a family. We often talk about our Anzac traditions that stem back to 1915, and so we should. Our citizens have fought and died together, side by side, defending our freedoms. We are bonded together by people, culture, business, sport and art. The coalition has the deepest respect for New Zealand and its people and welcomes people who are committed to Australian values and who respect our rights, liberties and laws. Australian citizenship is an incredible privilege, but with those privileges comes responsibilities. Those responsibilities are, just as those rights are, bestowed upon every single Australian and every single person that resides here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes to the New Zealand visa arrangements have a large cost. That was revealed in the budget papers. This is all part of Labor's 'big Australia' policy. In true Labor style, they made this big flashy announcement, but they were very light on the detail. I'll come back to that in a moment. What we see out of this policy, consistent with what we've seen through the rest of the budget that was announced in the last sitting period, is that Australian working taxpayers get very little out of this budget. Essential Australian working taxpayers will, as a result of this policy, be paying more. They will be paying more to feed Labor's voracious welfare policies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Providing permanent citizenship to 400,000 New Zealand citizens will increase payments from government services and benefits by $1.3 billion. This policy will cost Australian taxpayers $1.3 billion over five years from 2022-23. It will increase taxation receipts by $795 million over the same period. What this means is that there is a net fiscal cost of $500 million. That's half a billion dollars. This isn't just Andrew Wallace, the member for Fisher, saying this; this is from the budget papers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, Labor's all about the big flashy announcement, not about the detail. Let's have a look at some of the questions that this policy raises. Will New Zealand citizens who accept the offer to become an Australian citizen be included as part of the permanent immigration number or will they be counted separately? This is the 1.5 million additional people that Labor want to bring into this country over five years. Will those 400,000 be part of that 1.5 million or will that 400,000 be on top of the 1.5 million people that Labor want to bring into this country? Will the New Zealand citizens replace much-needed highly skilled workers like nurses, teachers and engineers? If they do fill spaces within the immigration cap, what is the government going to do to address the impact on the housing and rental crisis, congestion and the environment with increased migration? This is coming from a government that has just put every single infrastructure project that hasn't had a shovel put in the ground on review for the next 90 days. We know what that means. That's Labor speak for cuts, cuts and more cuts—unless, of course, the money was going to a Labor held electorate. There are many more questions to be answered. I'm hoping that my friend the member for Riverina will pick them up.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:39</span>):  In less than six weeks, New Zealanders will again have a direct pathway to Australian citizenship. It has been more than 20 years since the Howard government closed off that route with seemingly little thought of the longer-term ramifications. Even now, talk from the coalition about this long-overdue reform centres on the supposed financial costs. Dan Tehan says that, while he agrees in principle with the reforms, the opposition wants to know the costs of changing rules that have been in place for a long time. I'm reminded of the Oscar Wilde saying about those who know the price of everything and the value of nothing. I can tell you, from speaking to people in my community, what the cost of this policy has been: a generation of too many children, young people and teenagers who've been lost when it came to higher education, and a generation where too many skills were lost by this nation. That's a high economic price that this nation has already paid in lost productivity and more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let's look beyond the economics, beyond the dollars and cents. There were more personal and social costs arising from this policy—costs that affect this nation as a supposedly inclusive community: a generation of people who feel like second-class citizens, a generation of people who are actively discriminated against, a generation of people who feel that they don't belong and who don't have a stake in society. And we know what flows from that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As pointed out by the committed advocates at West Justice, a community legal centre in my electorate, as noncitizens our friends from across the ditch could largely not access loans that would enable them to attend tertiary education, whether to go to university or to enrol in highly skilled TAFE courses. What a waste of talent, consigning these children to limited career options and a very uncertain future indeed. What a waste for our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Imagine being a parent and sitting down with your teenager who is in year 9, which is when most students start to think about the elective subjects that will give them the best opportunity for a career and a fulfilling life. Imagine the conversation that follows, with parents explaining to their children that higher education simply isn't on the table for them. What do you think happens to that year 9 student—or to any person, for that matter—who has no pathway into higher education? Where is the motivation to study hard and to dream big when they know that the only future they can dream of is of limited employment options, regardless of how hard they study and regardless of how motivated they are?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For more than two decades we were happy to take the taxes these hardworking citizens paid but not to give them access to many of the rights that should flow from this. And it is not just access to the NDIS and many other social services but also—and I would say that in many ways this is more important—the feeling of belonging and that this is a nation that values their contribution. For years this nation has experienced a huge skills shortage. Is it any wonder, when we have not made the most of the talent that we have right here, living in our community—many individuals and many families who have lived here for very long periods of time? How many doctors, nurses, engineers, IT professionals, teachers and more have we not produced because of a discriminatory citizenship policy?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Joe Nunweek, a lawyer with West Justice, pointed out, even for highly skilled people career pathways were often closed off because they were generally barred from working in Commonwealth jobs. But, more importantly, as Joe explains, these changes mean that New Zealanders living in this country will finally feel that much-needed sense of belonging to a nation, no longer feeling like second-class citizens. As the Prime Minister recently said, New Zealanders who are here in Australia paying taxes, contributing to the economy, should be treated with respect, and that's what this provision will do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For far too long, New Zealanders who live, work and pay taxes in Australia have been left feeling permanently temporary. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement which brought Australia and New Zealand closer together by easing travel requirements between the two countries. What an apt time to reform our citizenship rules. I welcome the government's commitment to build a fairer and more inclusive migration system for New Zealanders living in Australia. I welcome the changes that better reflect the close relationship between our countries over decades.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:44</span>):  It's a little bit perplexing that we've spent the day hearing about how dreadful the coalition government was in the nine years that we served from 2013 to 2022, but this takes the cake. Now Labor is paying out on the Howard Liberal government. If the Howard Liberal government was so bad with this particular policy, why didn't Labor fix it when it was in power from 2007 to 2013? I could take issue with some of the things that Chile-born Chris Watson and his government did in 1904, but I'm not about to. It's history. Let's look to the future. Let's leave the past where it is and let's build a better Australia—not necessarily a bigger Australia but a better Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many questions which do need answering about this particular visa arrangement. Will New Zealand citizens who accept the offer to become Australian citizens be included as part of the permanent immigration number or counted separately? We know that Labor has this policy of a lottery-style system with Pacific immigration, and we haven't had this question answered. Will the New Zealand citizens replace much-needed highly skilled workers, such as teachers, nurses and engineers, if they do fill spaces within the immigration cap? What is the government going to do to address the impact on the housing crisis? We have a housing crisis, make no mistake. What will the impact be on the National Disability Insurance Scheme? The previous speaker mentioned this. Mind you, he wasn't in the government at the time, which left office without putting a cent towards this valuable scheme, the higher education loan program, social security or other government programs for the additional citizens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How will Labor treat citizens who are convicted of crimes and would previously—quite correctly—have been subjected to deportation? When we were in government we refused or cancelled 10,206 visas under the character provision test of the Migration Act, for good reason: because we didn't want these sorts of people in our country. There were 335 who were outlaw motorcycle gang members—people we do not want in our country. We do not want them subjecting people to their harm, particularly our country's young people. Labor is already tracking to kick out just half the number of non-citizens who fail the character test. Why? It's a good question and it deserves an answer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If this announcement is about a fair change, as Labor calls it, why will Australians wait five years to become New Zealand citizens but New Zealanders will wait only four years to become Australian citizens? What sort of deal did they do with the New Zealand government over this? The coalition supports a better Australia, as I said, but this situation is giving New Zealanders something that we can't get in return. Will the Labor government give New Zealanders who are not citizens a vote in Australian elections? The Prime Minister said that was being considered. Will they get a vote?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes to the New Zealand visa arrangements have a huge cost, and this is revealed in the budget papers. It's all part of Labor's Big Australia policy. Providing permanent citizenship to 400,000 New Zealand citizens will see increased payments for government services and benefits by—wait for it—$1.3 billion. That's $1.3 billion over five years from 2022-23 and increased receipts by $795 million over the same period. This is a cost to Australian taxpayers, who expected better in the budget. The reality fell far short of their expectations. Why did it fall far short? Because this is what you get under Labor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They want to put more people on welfare. It doesn't matter where they come from, let's just get more people on welfare! Let's get more people who will vote for us, who will never contribute to the Commonwealth and who will never contribute to Australian society! They will kick out far less people than they should. We're all in favour of New Zealanders. We've heard the stories of the Anzac spirit, and no-one understands that like those who've served our nation. Yet, this is a great thing. But I tell you what: there are so many answers still to be given and still to be provided by this policy. We await, with bated breath perhaps, as to whether they will be answered. I doubt it. Don't hold your breath.</span>

Following the budget, I spent a week out in the community reflecting upon it. I have formed an image where Labor has now absolutely taken control of the economy with this budget. You can't intervene. You can't get your fingers this deep into the budget without hitting your fingers. I'm picturing a Nigella Lawson kneading into a big cookie dough bowl, just putting her fingerprints all over it. That's how I see this economy now.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are ways to look very clearly at the impacts of this budget. Let's look at the impact on jobs. Labor came in a year ago with the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years. We hear a lot about the decade of delay. We don't often hear about a couple of these key facts, like the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years. Labor also came in with the rate of welfare dependency at its lowest level in 30 years. That was achieved just prior to the pandemic. It's a little thing the Treasurer doesn't speak a lot about.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of that, across the last term of the LNP government, two million jobs were created. If you compare that to the budget, what the budget predicts is that there will be 175,000 job losses across Australia. So there's a very clear difference from a government that created jobs, that oversaw one the greatest creations of jobs we have seen in our time, and had the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years to a government that is confirming in its second budget that 175,000 job losses will take place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at tax. Across the last term, the coalition reduced taxes for more than 11 million Australians. In the 2021-22 financial year, a person earning $90,000 was paying over $3,000 less in tax. The stage 3 tax cuts that we planned for ensured that 95 per cent of taxpayers would face a marginal rate of no more than 30 cents in the dollar. Small businesses had their tax rate reduced from 30 per cent down to 25 per cent, which was the lowest rate in 50 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, there's a stark comparison to what we've seen in this budget. We've seen a tax on farmers and fresh food, a tax on truckies, a tax on energy producers and higher taxes on low- to middle-income Australians. There's a very big difference in approach, a very big difference in intention and a big difference in consequences that we will see from this.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister was given two cracks at this cherry. I'm happy to say I'm going to see if I can do it in one here today. Yes, Australia's core inflation rate is higher than the UK, higher than the US and higher than the EU area. It's higher than every G7 nation. Goodness me, that wasn't that hard to do! I don't know why this fact can't be addressed. Oh, maybe it could be! There's the simple point that there are things that you can do about inflation, and different countries have approached it differently. When we look at Australia's response and see our inflation higher than those countries, perhaps it's worth asking what are the things that have created that? We can't continue to talk back to external influences that are driving inflation. As the RBA governor has well and truly confirmed, the drivers of that inflation have moved internally; they are domestic drivers now. When we see $185 billion of additional spending in this budget at a time when inflation is this high, when economists laughingly refer to this as a stimulus budget, that's exactly what we're doing, we're pouring fuel on the fire.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where does this budget leave us? I saw a fantastic cartoon in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span>. It's not usually a paper that is very friendly towards this side of the House. There's a picture of a little girl chasing a balloon that was floating away from her. It's out of her reach. She's chasing it, and the balloon is shaped like a house. Of course, housing is out of the question for that next generation. It's getting worse and worse. And what is the wind that is blowing that balloon away? It's 1.5 million new Australians coming in in the middle of a housing crisis. If things were bad before—</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="299174" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAXALE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:55</span>):  It gives me pleasure to speak on this budget that was handed down by Treasurer Chalmers and, of course, the Labor government. When you read this motion, you see that they almost got it right. One of the parts says, 'We note that the government's second budget is an opportunity to correct the mistakes of its first.' They're so close to getting it right. This budget wasn't an opportunity to correct the mistakes of the last budget; it was an opportunity to correct the mistakes of the last government's budget—the last nine years of financial recklessness. This year's budget was an opportunity to correct the mistakes of the Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments and an opportunity to correct the trillion dollars worth of Liberal debt that was left behind. It was an opportunity to correct the unfunded government programs like myGov, e-health records and countless others, and it was an opportunity to correct increases in the cost of seeing a doctor, which we all know shot up under the previous government's watch. It was an opportunity to restore sensible budget practices once again, instead of the economic management bin fire we had under the former government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 9 May, this government presented a budget that was responsible and that had a heart. We turned around the largest budget deficit in history—a whopping $78 billion left by the previous government. This financial year we know we are on track to deliver a slim budget surplus. What a turnaround! That feat alone sets this budget apart, demonstrating our commitment to fiscal responsibility and to the welfare of our nation. Our budgetary approach is grounded in sound economic principles, with 87 per cent of revenue upgrades being reinvested back into the budget. Compare that to the previous budgets of the Morrison government, which returned only 40 per cent of budget upgrades to the bottom line, and the Howard government, which returned even less—30 per cent—to the bottom line. This decision now over two budgets returns order to our nation's finances. Instead of the bin fire of economic responsibility by the Liberals, we now have responsible management of our money, which will significantly reduce national debt over the coming years, saving us all hundreds of billions of dollars of interest rate payments over the medium and long term.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's also a budget with a heart. It's a budget that delivers genuine cost-of-living relief to Australian families. To alleviate the financial pressures faced by households, there is energy bill relief for five million households across the country. In my home state of New South Wales alone, 1.6 million households will enjoy savings of $500 on their energy bills. This is real relief that will impact those who need it. We're also investing an unprecedented $5.7 billion in health care to strengthen Medicare services. We will triple the bulk-billing incentives for common consultations involving children under 16 and Commonwealth concession cardholders. That means 60 per cent of presentations will be covered by this bulk-billing incentive, and that means around 66,000 eligible Australians in my electorate of Bennelong will get access to cheaper visits to the doctor, ensuring that quality health care remains within reach. Our commitment to a more robust and secure emissions reduction economy remains unwavering. There is $4 billion to create our Renewable Energy Superpower plan, bolstering our dedication to clean energy and sustainable practices. We will invest $2 billion to make green hydrogen for our regions. Skills development is also being invested in, with 180,000 fee-free TAFE places in the last budget and an additional $400 million allocated to deliver 300,000 fee-free TAFE and VET places. We know that we're in a skills crisis, and we are a government that will invest in skilling up Australians through apprenticeship programs and through TAFE.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Small businesses—the lifeblood of our economy—will receive much-needed support through this budget. The instant asset write-off threshold is up to $20,000, benefiting up to 1.2 million small businesses, and $650 off their bill automatically for 332,000 small businesses in New South Wales.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget reinforces our commitment to fix the mess of the former government that was left to us and to pave the way for a brighter and better future for Australia. We are committed to fixing the mess and to also providing support to those who need it most. </span>

They've never had it so good.' I can tell you that, out there in everyday mum-and-dad land in Australia, they are hurting and they are hurting big time. If you are a self-funded retiree or are on wages, you are working or are in small business, this budget that was just handed down by this Labor government does absolutely nothing for you. It is one of the biggest redistributions of wealth that this country has ever seen.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ask yourself this question: Do you feel better off now today than you felt 12 months ago? The answer to that question, everywhere I ask it, is, of course, no. I've done community forums. I've spoken to many people in my electorate and all that I've heard is 'Australians are doing it tough'. They are doing it hard because of this government's failure to address the out-of-control cost of living in this country.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the saddest things to come out of this Labor government, just in the last couple of weeks, is this so-called 90-day review of infrastructure. This is the big con job that Labor put in this last budget. Apparently, according to the minister for infrastructure, they've kept $1.6 billion in the budget for vital infrastructure projects in my electorate like Sunshine Coast rail. Apparently, they've kept it in. Yet they have this 90-day review which is reviewing every single infrastructure project in this country that hasn't to date had a shovel in the ground. That puts at risk North Coast rail, a project that Ted O'Brien and I worked assiduously on for the last seven years to get $1.6 billion from the previous coalition government. I fear that this lot are going to rip it up and pull it out and do what they do best—redistribute it to their own electorates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the other projects is greatly at risk. Quite frankly, it beggars belief that they would do this. Back in 2019, the coalition government provided $160 million for half the cost of the Malula River interchange. We didn't put one cent in but we said to the state, 'We will put in half. You put in half—$320 million all up for the first stage.' This is one of the most dangerous intersections on the Sunshine Coast. There are lots of collisions, lots of people being hurt—very dangerous. It was a good project. That's why we were prepared to put money up front.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;">
                  </span>One of the challenges with the project is that the state government has had to resume and ultimately evict people from 130 homes to build this project. It's important—it's very important—but it has meant that around 400 Sunshine Coast locals have been evicted in one of the greatest housing and homelessness crises this country has ever seen. But now, whilst the government is making this big announcement about a national housing fund, borrowing $10 billion, which is effectively a Ponzi scheme, hoping that they make more money than what it will cost them in interest payments, that project could be on the chopping block. Around 400 Australians, 400 Sunshine Coast locals, have been evicted from their homes, and now there's a great big shadow hanging over this project. Shame on Labor. If they were serious about housing, they would say that the $160 million stays and that project will go ahead. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="299150" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LAWRENCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasl</span><span class="HPS-Electorate">uck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:05</span>):  I thank the member for Forde for the opportunity to speak on the budget and on our government's actions to slow inflation and provide relief for millions of families across Australia and tens of thousands in the electorate of Hasluck, which I've now had the honour of serving for one year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion mentions fiscal restraint. International observers such as Bloomberg noted the government is on the 'path of fiscal restraint' with the May budget, and our own Chamber of Commerce and Industry praised the government's fiscal restraint. These are independent commentators who have said our budget straddles the line well, with relief for those who need it most, investment in public services and innovation, banking most of the surplus revenue and paying down the Liberal debt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Forde wants simpler and fairer taxes. There are a few tax measures in the budget. A modest increase in tax revenue off the back of the eye-watering profits that resource companies are making from our minerals and gas sounds pretty fair to me and to the many constituents I've spoken to. A modest tweak to our overly generous super tax concessions for literal multimillionaires—I'm struggling to find anyone who considers this an attack on fairness. The 15 per cent global minimum tax aims to ensure that multinationals and others who seek to avoid their fair tax obligations in this country can no longer get away with it. I expect that the member for Forde, if he indeed supports fair taxes, will support this legislation when it comes to the House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Forde calls for 'real action on productivity'. I can well understand the member wanting this government to grapple with that one, as the last nine years were, on the evidence, a productivity-free zone. Challenge accepted. It's something we can work on together in the House economics committee, and I know there's more than one minister very interested in seeing our report on economic dynamism later in the year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion goes on, helpfully, with 'measured relief for small business and families that does not add to inflation'. The budget relief isn't just neutral; it's even anti-inflationary. These measures include relief from energy prices for business, and cheaper child care and cheaper medicines for families. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very proud of this government's achievements thus far, and they are legion. Because the government's program addresses what we need to have a progressive, fair, functioning society in 2023, it includes trust in government, an educated population, a healthy population, action on climate change, a functional safety net, gender equity, investment in the future and pride in our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget contains funding specifically for a national anticorruption commission, commencing in July, which will instil a new confidence in the workings of government, underpinning trust in our democracy. There are 300,000 fee-free TAFE places. Young people can gain skills and older workers can reskill as we transition to a green economy. There are real savings for Australians on the cost of medicines, and there is real support for Medicare for our most vulnerable. Urgent care clinics are to be rolled out across the country to meet local needs and to take pressure off emergency departments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are investing in what we know will be a challenging but necessary transition to a green energy economy, with emissions goals legislated, the safeguard mechanism enacted—properly this time—and significant investments in renewable technologies like hydrogen and EVs, and a national reconstruction fund to support further innovation. Aged-care workers will receive a record pay rise, and the government's very first action, of which we are all proud, was to support a significant increase in the minimum wage. Cheaper child care will help over a million Australian families, and the government's commitments to fairer workplaces and a fairer health system reflect the belief that gender equity must underpin all progress in a modern society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is investing in the future of the country. In Hasluck this means progressing the Ellenbrook Line of Metronet and an Olympic-size swimming pool in Ellenbrook and addressing the NBN and other communications issues in the Swan Valley and the Perth Hills. The government is also reinvesting in the arts, with the new Creative Australia, so that our stories can be told. And on the international stage the Prime Minister, the foreign minister, the trade minister and many other ministers have given us cause to be proud again as they re-establish Australia's place in the world. The member for Forde speaks of balancing the budget. Of course the Treasurer was pleased to bring down a surplus, so I expect that the member will have already congratulated the Treasurer on that score.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am grateful for the motion, which supports the government's budget actions. But it's time now for us to address the structural deficit left to us by the previous Morrison government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="279991" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CONAGHAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowper</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:10</span>):  I'd like to start by thanking all the Australians who have contributed to Labor's first budget surplus in 30 years, and they are the regional Australians, particularly those regional Australians who work in the natural resources sector or, as the Treasurer puts it, 'those things that we sell overseas'—very covertly put in the budget speech. Those things that we sell overseas are gas, coal and iron ore, which have seen this government able to put forward its first budget surplus in a very long time. The Treasurer can knock back that fact as much as he likes, saying that obviously the resources sector is making an important contribution. But the fact is that they are the X factor; they are the reason that this government has seen a budget surplus.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, again—and I'm not repeating myself—we should say thanks to regional Australians, not for providing the tax dollars but for making the sacrifices, and by sacrifices I mean that this budget has ripped out the vast majority of previously planned infrastructure projects to the tune of $23 billion. Sadly, one of these was stage 2 of the Southern Cross Health Precinct, an operational health precinct that would have seen up to 48,000 patients a year. Lismore has one, and that's how many patients they see. Can you imagine how much pressure that would take off the health system within Coffs Harbour? That's 48,000 consults.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note my friend across the floor, the member for Solomon. I thank him for his service to our country. We also lost a veterans centre: $5 million had been put aside for a veterans centre. We have the highest cohort of veterans on the Mid North Coast in New South Wales. The data speaks for itself. Yet the $5 million that was put aside for not one but three hub-and-spoke-model veterans centres was taken away. To compound this, the director of Soldier On in Port Macquarie has just been told that she's been made redundant. Where are these people going to go? Where are these veterans—who served our country, who gave us our freedoms, who put their lives on the line—going to go?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And it took up to two weeks before the budget announcement to announce that another $120 billion worth of infrastructure projects were going to be put on pause. I heard a previous speaker talk about colour-coded charts. Well, the ANAO said that they were all worthy projects, and these were all worthy projects. Yet they're going to sit there for who knows how long until the minister decides what she's going to do with them. Many of these cancelled or on-hold projects were not even about helping the regions grow. In fact, we aren't even being thrown enough scrap in the budget to sustain our current populations, particularly in the coastal electorates like Cowper that have seen unprecedented levels of growth as a result of COVID-19, with people moving away from the major cities. Everybody's suffering from the housing crisis, but it is at a peak in those coastal areas. This is money that is now not going to maintain or improve our roads, not going to provide adequate communications in the regions, not going to housing development projects, with the removal of the Stronger Community Program, and not going to support our critical volunteer groups.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You would think farmers might be given something, but in this budget they are being slogged with a biosecurity tax that keeps our nation's $90 billion agricultural industry safe and food on our tables. It just makes no sense that we would slog our farmers. In terms of this budget, there has been a lot of backslapping and hoo-ha, but it will do nothing for the people in our regions.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:15</span>):  If you're a small business in the Blue Mountains or the Hawkesbury, I know that for many of you things are tough. Supermarkets and retailers tell me they've seen changes in buying patterns as a result of the price rises on many products, although they also tell me that they are starting to see the increases stabilising. I ran a small business for 25 years and I know that the more than 12,000 small businesses in Macquarie are the lifeblood of our economy and our community. This budget is investing in the security and certainty that they need to thrive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know economic conditions have been challenging for Australia's small businesses, which is why the government has delivered targeted and responsible support, improved the overall business operating environment and helped business owners reduce energy price pressures. At the centre of this support is our energy price relief plan that will shield Australia households and small businesses from the worst impacts of rising energy prices. In partnership with the New South Wales government, we are providing $650 in electricity bill relief to eligible small businesses or those whose turnover is over $50 million a year. We're also introducing the small business energy incentive. This is a bonus tax deduction to help up to 3.8 million small and medium-sized businesses save energy by upgrading their facilities or finding a way to save on their energy bills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are temporarily increasing the instant asset write-off threshold to $20,000 for business with a turnover of up to $10 million for the next year. We are reducing the time small businesses spend doing taxes, saving them both time and money. Measures include allowing longer to amend your tax returns, trialling an independent review for small businesses in dispute with the ATO and expanding access to advice through the Tax Clinic program. We are also introducing really practical measures to guard small businesses against cyberthreats through the $23 million program to help them train in-house cyber wardens. There is nothing worse as a small business than finding you have been hacked, whether it is your social media or other IT. This will help.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government knows just how vital small businesses are to our nation's economy and our local prosperity. That's why this budget's committed to helping them tackle immediate challenges, like energy costs, as well as helping set them up for long-term success with the investments in cybersecurity and cutting red tape.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also supporting businesses who work in the film industry. Over the past five years, 40 international productions have been secured for Australia. These productions, which usually come from the US, have created more than 22,000 employment opportunities and work for more than 23,500 individual Australian businesses. Between 2018 and 2021, these productions supported more than 9,000 regional jobs and 4,700 regional businesses. So it's big money coming into local economies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Typically, 60 per cent of the spend by international producers is with businesses outside the screen sector. I am talking about transport and accommodation providers, catering, venue hire, legal services and financial services. But, in my electorate, it's things like animal trainers. Two productions in Macquarie have accessed the incredible talent we have in training. I got to go on set at the Ryan Gosling <span style="font-style:italic;">The Fall Guy</span> movie to watch a local Hawkesbury trainer—</span>
              </p>

                  </a>  Yes, it was very cool—and her dog with Ryan Gosling. What was more interesting, quite frankly, than watching Ryan Gosling was talking to the local businesses there. They're training people up on these film sets. They're getting to use really big equipment that they otherwise might not get to use. You can see the real drive it gives to that film production sector. The other business that really relies on this is performance livestock. Renee and Graham specialise in horses but also work with dogs, cats and livestock such as goats, sheep, cattle and camels here in movies such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Planet of the Apes</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, we've made sure that these businesses will continue to have work on major films, and we've done that by raising the location offset to a permanent level of 30 per cent. That gives international producers the certainty they need to invest here, and it also gives our local businesses the certainty they need to ensure that they're training people up and that they're able to stay working in this important sector.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, these sorts of text messages—and the phone calls and the emails—have become more and more familiar to Australians over the last few years. While we may roll our eyes and laugh at some of these seemingly amateurish attempts, it is sobering to know that Australians lost some $3.1 billion in 2022 to scammers, and that number has been doubling year on year. Telecommunication companies blocked 90 million scam texts between July and December 2022.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some years ago I heard about an overseas scamming operation that had been shut down by international law enforcement. The key operatives arrested included, as you would expect, people with expertise in computing, but there were also several with PhDs in psychology, because, while we can do a lot technically to protect ourselves, as can the organisations we engage with, through secure passwords, two-factor authentication and the like, social engineering is the way that most people lose to scammers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Scammers work hard to con people, to trick them into believing that they're your friend, your child, your bank, your internet company, or a great investment or an employment opportunity that will change your life—get in quick! Too many Australians lose big money to scammers. They lose money, they lose their identities, and there is embarrassment, shame and a lack of confidence in engaging with the world around us. While we can measure the amount of money stolen by the scammers every year—at least if the amount is reported to authorities—the damage these scammers do is immeasurable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones and I held a scams forum in Boothby. The event was booked out within a day or so and we have a waiting list for a repeat event. Mr Jones covered some of the more common types of scams: fishing scams, dating and romance scams, false billing scams, investment scams, employment scams. They are all too-good-to-be-true scams. He also shared a few hints on how to be more aware: protect yourself; take your time; don't let them rush you; be alert to typos. Know that your bank won't engage you as 'Dear Sir/Madam'. Don't click on any links sent to you. Don't give personal information over the phone to callers. If they say they are from a company that you genuinely deal with, stop, hang up and call them back. Look up the organisation's phone number or website independently and call them on a number that you have verified. Don't let anyone have remote access to your computer. Be wary of anyone trying to move you from a public form of social media to a private one such as a WhatsApp or a messenger.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is taking the issue of scams seriously. We have seen the damage scammers are doing in our communities and to individuals, and we are determined to take them on. Part of that is raising awareness and improving education in our communities, and the scams forum being conducted around the country by the Assistant Treasurer is a visible part of that effort. Unlike the previous government, we're not just standing by to watch the scams increase, doubling every year, without lifting a finger.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People all over Australia are saying enough is enough, and that's why we've already taken action, providing $86.5 million to combat scams in this budget. This money will provide $58 million to the ACCC to establish a national anti-scam centre to improve detection, deterrence and prevention. There's money for ASIC to combat investment scams and $10.9 million for an SMS sender registry so that, rather than playing catch-up on the phone numbers that we're trying to block for sending scam messages, banks, telecommunication companies, utilities and government agencies will be able to register the genuine numbers that they will contact people from so Australians can feel confident in dealing with those institutions and know to be sceptical about calls from other numbers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The scams that attack Australians on a daily basis have been increasing over recent years, and the Albanese Labor government is stepping in to protect us all.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:26</span>):  Thank you, Deputy Speaker Wilkie, for the invitation to speak on this very important motion. It's not often I get to congratulate the government on things that they're doing, but this is one time that I congratulate them on what they're doing, because they have followed on from the good record of the previous government, which was, sadly, alluded to in a negative form. Two of the smartest people I know—I mean smart people, good businesspeople—were scammed. One cannot retrieve the money, and it's big money. The other, because of a mistake the bank made, was able to retrieve the money, which is a godsend. What I'm putting to you is this: no-one is immune from these scams. We are a nation that thinks people are doing the right thing by us when they get on the phone to us and they offer us help. We think, oh, we're probably out of order there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I got a scam on tolls. I said to my wife: 'Bron, hang on. I've got a toll problem here. I can't afford to have a toll problem.' She said: 'It's a scam. You don't pay for the tolls; I do. They are having a go at you, but I pay for them. So it's got nothing to do with us; it's a scam.' It didn't look like a scam to me, because I had recently changed my credit card. Automatically I thought, 'Oh, I've changed my credit card; therefore, they want the new details for my credit card,' and I was about to give it to them because it was common sense. What I'm saying is that everybody is vulnerable to this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate the government. We lost $3.1 billion to scammers because they're trading on the good people that Australians are.</span>

I know there are other issues that I would disagree with the government on. I won't go into the processes the former government went into—I'll get a chance later on this evening to do that. I'm appealing to the people that are watching this very good motion. The government can do so much, but there will not be a fire truck at the bottom of your driveway when it comes to scams. The government cannot have a fire truck at the bottom of every cliff. The bank can't save you—it's up to you to be diligent. I have this saying with my staff—and I've lived this through the whole of my 72 years—if in doubt, don't. If there's the slightest doubt, don't go there. Talk to your kids, talk to somebody else before you act on it. Do not give your details to anybody because the bank doesn't ring you and ask you for details—they've got them. Please, I'm begging you—and I've never begged anybody in this parliament before—please have regard for your own wellbeing.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:31</span>):  Like the speakers before me, my community has been inundated by scam texts and messages. In fact, in a few recent school visits—it's that time of year in Victoria when the curriculum asks the teachers to talk about our democracy and the levels of government, so I'm often invited in to talk to students about those things—I take the opportunity while there to do a bit of a straw poll on what social things that children as young as grade 4 are aware of. The winner this year is scams.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every kid that I've asked this question of, and for every class or group of 100 students that I've asked, 'Who's worried about scams?', the hands go up. These young people all have a story about someone in their family being hacked, being scammed, or about money being lost. When we see figures like $3 billion in the last 12 months, it's not a surprise if it's everyone and every family in my electorate that has been receiving these texts. As the member for Boothby said, if people in their busy lives see a text created with some urgency, they act. If a child's in trouble, you act—here's a solution. These scanners are clever. Not only have I got your number, not only do I know you've got a son, but I also know his name because I've hacked your phone and I'm going to set a text up where I not only create the urgent need but also create the solution in one simple text—click, send. They're targeting not only parents with stories about children but also mates. Your best friend sends you a supposed text message asking for financial assistance. There it is, on a busy day, saying they've lost $1000. I'll help fix that! I can fix that! I can be helpful! It's not a surprise when the member for Boothby sites that psychologists are involved in this. This is really clever. Clever, manipulative, criminal—that's what it is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased that our government is taking the action it can at this point in seeking more information for further changes—the first being the SMS Sender ID Registry to protect yourself. I read that and I had to go in and figure out what they're talking about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are actually saying is that the scammers have become so good that they are copying the headers on the text messages that official trusted Australian institutions might use. They are copying those headers, so people who are accustomed to getting a text message from a particular institution, be it your bank, be it someone else, think it is them. Step one—clever—creating urgency. I can't tell you how many Linkt texts I've had in the last six months. Occasionally, they are persistent but they come spasmodically. Occasionally, I go, 'Is this a real one? Should I check?' Of course, as the previous member said, 'It's not real. I don't owe any money to the tolls,' but you would be surprised how many Australians believe they do, because people often have busy lives, take a toll road and think they will pay for it later. They then can't remember what day they did it or whether or not they paid for it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not just Linkt messages have I had. I've also had so many packages at the Alice Springs post office waiting for collection. I've lost count of the number of times I've had a package waiting. And do you know how I figured out it was Alice Springs? I googled it to find out where that post office was and went, 'I couldn't possibly have a package waiting for me in Alice Springs.' But I would have had 400 of those texts in the last 12 months, so they are persistent, they are consistent and it's not a surprise that Australians, with this psychological effort being made, are being drawn into them. I am pleased this government has made a commitment in the budget and that it has been the actions of this government to look at what can we do and to look at the types of scams. There are ways we can protect, like the ID registry, and then there is the educative part of this around educating Australians to being, quite bluntly, more cynical.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In an age where we are losing trust in our democratic institutions, maybe it's an age where we could get a bit smarter about the things we carry in our hands and the messages we are receiving from people. But the educative process will take a long time. I hope this hits the ground running, that we protect Australians and that we don't lose $3 billion in the next year.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="241067" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr COLEMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Banks</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:37</span>):  I'm pleased to speak on this motion on scams. What we are seeing with the scams, unfortunately, is an escalation, where they get more and more sophisticated over time. The technology, frankly, gets better and better, which enables them to pursue more scams and exploit them more effectively. Importantly, scams are migrating increasingly from the text based mobile phone world to the broader digital and social media world. I want to come back to that in a minute because, unfortunately, the government has not acted in that important area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in December 2020, our government introduced an important industry code, a reducing scam calls code, and, under the code, telcos that breached those rules would be fined up to $250,000 on each occasion. There was very, very clear evidence that it worked because in the first 12 months of that new code, 357 million scam calls were blocked and that's a very good thing. In November 2021, we introduced a regulatory amendment to empower the telco sector to block SMS scams at source and, happily, the new government took that up and it was implemented on 1 July last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the ACCC has correctly noted, the true cost of scams is more than a dollar figure because they cause emotional distress to victims, their families and their businesses. We pretty much all have either been the victim of a scam or know someone who has. Unfortunately, it is often older people, who perhaps are not as familiar with technology and who take at face value some of those texts messages and calls that sometimes come along. We've all experienced it and it is a horrible thing, so measures to reduce the incidence of scams are welcome. We certainly have no quibble with the government taking strong steps in this area. We absolutely support that. But there is an important gap in what the government is not doing at the moment as it pertains to scams and this relates to something the ACCC has been calling for in its digital platforms inquiry. The first publication was November last year and there was a six-monthly update a few weeks ago. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ACCC is particularly focused on broadening the scope of the regulation of scams, not just in the telco world but in the broader digital world as well. So what the ACCC has asked the government to do is to introduce mandatory processes to prevent and remove scams, harmful apps and fake reviews; to establish mandatory internal dispute resolution standards that ensure accessibility, timeliness, accountability, the ability to escalate to a human representative and transparency; and to ensure consumers and small businesses have access to an independent external digital ombudsman scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, who already exists and regulates the telco sector, put their hand up and said: 'We can do this. We can be the digital ombudsman for scams in a digital world.' On the face of it that would seem very sensible, with the already active telecommunications ombudsman doing precisely this in the telco world. But what about the digital world? What about the scams on Facebook? What about the scams on TikTok, Instagram or any of those platforms? They are currently not captured by these rules, so the government needs to do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's now been six or seven months since the ACCC made this recommendation. Time is of the essence because every day we see literally millions of dollars lost to scams. There really is no time for being slow here. To be frank, the government is hastening a little slowly. Opposition leader Peter Dutton announced in our budget reply speech that this issue is very important. It's a big focus for the coalition, and we will put in place more onerous obligations on big digital companies to stop scams and financial fraud.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A big part of that goes what I've just been talking about: establishing that regulatory environment for the digital world, which doesn't properly exist today. One part is covered and one part, which is enormous, is not covered. It doesn't make sense. The ACCC doesn't think it makes sense. The Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman doesn't think it makes sense. We don't think it makes sense. The government needs to act on that. The SMS sender ID register, blocking people impersonating the government, is a welcome initiative from the government, but it's somewhat ironic given that the most famous scam impersonating a government over text in Australian history was the 'Mediscare' scam purported by the Labor Party.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This country is in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis. Interest rates are rising, everyday household items are becoming more expensive and families are worried about making ends meet. Whilst times are certainly tough for Australians, there is an underlying contributing factor that we are simply not speaking about: Australia's declining financial literacy standards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Financial literacy is the possession of the skills and knowledge necessary to make smart and informed decisions about your personal finances. It is one of the most basic and important skill sets that every person and Australian should and must have. Whether they're trying to save for their first house, paying for their child's education or making their weekly shopping list, every day every Australian makes personal financial decisions that impact their bottom line. Alarmingly, though, 86 per cent of Australians do not know or understand their monthly expenses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia also ranks fifth in the world out of all the OECD countries for the highest percentage of household debt, and now we have a combined total of over $17 billion of personal credit card debt in this country. Simply put, Australians' relationship with their own money needs to change. This is not a mindset or cycle we want our children and grandchildren to fall into. That's why I'm calling upon the federal government to introduce compulsory financial literacy as part of the national curriculum. If we look at where our children receive their financial literacy from, most children get their personal financial understanding from either their parents or maths based subjects in school. But with only 50 per cent of Australian adults considered to be financially literate, and a significant decrease in enrolments in maths- and economics-based subjects in senior years, it is clear that we have a problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we delve into this even further, the fact that maths is not compulsory in all Australian states and territories in senior years and that boys usually outnumber girls by two to one in maths based subjects means that we have created a very real situation in which some children, especially young girls, grow up never having an informed discussion about their personal finances. No wonder there is a direct correlation between increased rates of homelessness amongst women and a lack of financial literacy. Financial literacy in schools would help reduce homelessness amongst women as it would give young girls the skills to be more actively engaged in managing their own finances later in life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Financial literacy in schools would also improve mental health and the wellbeing of Australians. A recent study by ASIC and Beyond Blue highlights that people who are experiencing financial challenges are twice as likely to have experienced mental health challenges. Financial stress also leads to relationship and marriage breakdowns, increased depression and anxiety, and an overall decrease in the quality of their life. So, not only does this motion help with creating better financial habits for the next generation; it also helps address the social and emotional wellbeing of Australians. Financial literacy in schools would make not only our households grow stronger and more adaptable but so, too, our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is our responsibility to ensure that the next generation is equipped with the skills that they need to be confident in making smart personal financial decisions so that they can get ahead, especially as we become a cashless society, where knowing what a dollar is and understanding the value of that dollar will become increasingly difficult for future generations to understand. What is a budget? How do interest rates work? What are the implications of credit scores and superannuation? How to save, how to invest and how to live within your means should be taught in schools and must become compulsory as part of our National Curriculum. Financial literacy in schools would mean that those children born into disadvantaged families could learn in the classroom how to save and invest and work towards a better life. Financial literacy in schools would mean that we could help the next generation avoid unnecessary household and credit card debt, because they would be smarter about their financial choices. And financial literacy in schools would mean creating a generation of financially resilient Australians who are in control of their own money.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:47</span>):  I thank the member for Bonner for putting forward this motion, much of which is absolutely on the mark, about the need to increase financial literacy. It's just a shame that the government he was a part of negotiated the National Curriculum while it was in government and didn't do this, over 10 years. I don't know: perhaps the member for Bonner asked them to and they didn't listen, so he's hoping to get a better reception from a government that is very serious about supporting financial literacy initiatives across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to tell the Federation Chamber about a remarkable program that operates in my community that showcases the value of financial education. It's the Brotherhood of St Laurence's Saver Plus program, which I first became aware of after I was elected and was visiting Aldercourt Primary School in Frankston North with the Brotherhood. Saver Plus is a financial education program for families and individuals who are on a tight budget, to develop lifelong saving habits. It sounds kind of simple, doesn't it? But it's not that simple for many people. One of the stories we heard during the visit was from a local mum who spoke of the difference a course like that had made not just to her but to her child and to their life—something as commonplace, for many people, as enrolling your child in swimming lessons. She knew her finances weren't good. She knew she needed to work on them. But she just found it too complicated—a single mum, too busy, too overwhelmed, who didn't know where to start and so didn't start. But she did start the Saver Plus program. Her goal was to save up enough money so her child could do that most basic thing in Australia: learn how to swim. Her story was remarkable, because Saver Plus provided her with the capacity and knowledge she wanted and needed. Not only was she able to put her child through swimming lessons but she was able to get her finances back on track and to talk about the changes she had made in her life and the way she dealt with her very tight finances to ensure that there was enough money for those 'extra' things like swimming lessons and saving for a rainy day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Certainly in Melbourne there have been a lot of rainy days lately, but that metaphor of a rainy day, I think, extends to what people are calling the cost-of-living crisis at the moment. Lots of people are experiencing rainy days, and financial literacy is such a fundamentally important tool for people to have before they hit those rainy days. There are literally hundreds of people on the Mornington Peninsula and in Frankston who have taken advantage of Saver Plus. There was another program I learnt about while I was at Aldercourt, which is the HIPPY program. This program also empowers parents. It provides them with the tools, knowledge and confidence to engage in their child's education, and that's having a profound impact as well on the community. Again, it's not solely for single mothers, but single mothers in particular are finding ways to support themselves and their child's development and setting up their families for healthier and brighter futures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the sorts of programs that I want to see governments invest in, because they're programs that help people invest in themselves, including people who come from circumstances where they haven't been unable to invest in themselves before and who just need that bit of assistance. This is why the government that I'm proud to be a part of has introduced a number of measures in the last 12 months that go towards helping people who are caught because of a lack of financial and other literacy by scams and online frauds, for example—not just in terms of pursuing the people who are doing it but in terms of helping to educate people how not to be caught. It's often the other end of the age scale—not the young parents but older members of our community—who get caught by those online scams. I almost got caught by phone calls from someone pretending to be from my bank. They're very sophisticated and that's also a very important thing to do. There was also an announcement this week about regulating buy-now pay-later services to help people only spend the money that they can afford or only borrow the money they can afford to pay back.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:52</span>):  I would like to thank the member for Bonner for bringing the motion to the House. Literacy and numeracy skills—and particularly financial literacy skills, as the member for Bonner has outlined in this motion—underpin a range of essential skills which will equip people throughout their lives. These are critically important. In the community that I represent in Logan, I see those in our community who have tremendous financial literacy skills and have gone on to great success in any number of areas or endeavours. But equally, sadly, I have seen those who have struggled with financial literacy skills, and for many, this has impacted on their ability to be involved in the workforce, with some finishing up in situations where they think they've got to take a chance gambling or finding other ways to try and make money because they've not been able to manage their financial circumstances properly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to extend the member for Bonner's motion a little bit to include not just financial literacy and numeracy skills but literacy and numeracy more generally. We know that having proficiency in literacy and numeracy has a pivotal impact on people's social and health outcomes throughout their life. It impacts not just the parents who struggle with those basic skills but also the kids who are raised in those households. We see that transferred to the younger generation. Certainly, in my electorate of Forde and across the city of Logan, we see families that have struggled with the generational impact of a lack of literacy and numeracy skills. It provides an inability for young people to successfully engage in the workforce and it creates challenges, as the member for Bonner quite rightly touched on. It has an impact on people's mental health later in life, further discouraging them from participating meaningfully in society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to take this opportunity to give a shout-out to the Financial Literacy Action Group, which is based in Logan and seeks to help people in these very circumstances. It's a broad-ranging community organisation, a coalition of various groups that provides help and assistance to people in this situation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's important is how we start to deal with these issues for the longer term, and I believe that starts at school. If you look at the results from our education system, Australia's results in reading and mathematical literacy have declined sharply over the last 20 years. Unfortunately, the member for Dunkley sought to make a political point on this, but I would say that governments of all persuasions have presided over these results for a long period of time, and we in this place all need to accept responsibility for that, irrespective of what side of the Chamber we are on. The solution to this problem is a bipartisan one. It's not a partisan solution; we need to work together to solve these problems, because they exist in communities right across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I talk to my school principals about the national curriculum, they say to me: 'It is so overcrowded that we genuinely don't have the time to focus in detail on these basic skills with the students who are struggling with them.' I had a meeting as late as last week with one of my school principals and I asked him whether he was in a position to have a differentiated curriculum for those students who are struggling with the standard curriculum in order to assist them to build on these basic skills and set them up for the future. He said he would love to do that; however, he's worried that, if he does start doing something different with the curriculum and different from what is allowed under the national curriculum, at an audit he might lose funding or have his funding reduced, so why would he take that risk? That's why I say that we need to have a broad-ranging discussion about a bipartisan solution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to look at these basic skills, which the member for Bonner has well outlined in this motion. I think it's critically important for the future. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr RAE:</span>
                  </a>  When this government was elected 12 months and one day ago, Labor member for Bennelong, we inherited a trillion dollars of Liberal debt. What we didn't inherit were the mugs that had gone with the claim of surplus that we never saw come to fruition. I think that's a decent place to start as we drill our way through the challenges of financial literacy in our society. It's where a former government essentially preyed upon some of the gap of knowledge in our community in order to serve their political purposes at the expense of increasing understanding and, indeed, having a robust and honest debate about our country's financial position. In fact, the now opposition spent nine years in government running financial capability surveys, but, when it came to improving financial literacy through education pursuits and consumer protection efforts, they left Australians to fend for themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government has taken a totally different approach to this in many ways. I note we have delivered our first full-financial-year budget. The Treasurer, Jim Chalmers, did so a week and a half ago. It was our first full-financial-year budget and it had the first surplus in 15 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr RAE:</span>
                  </a>  Yes, back in black, Member for Bennelong. So when our government speaks to the financial position of the country, when we come to the Australian people and explain to them the way that we are managing the economic challenges that our country faces, we do so with honesty and integrity. We delivered a small surplus, but there are challenges on the horizon. We have been upfront about that. We haven't tried to sugar-coat it or dress up a decade of budget deficit in egotism and cheap giftshop paraphernalia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to consumer affairs more broadly—and this is the very serious crux of where some of our financial literacy challenges lie—we have had a laser-like focus on improving consumer protections and creating safe and well-regulated financial markets. This has been part of a broader effort. We're boosting education. We're boosting awareness. We're bringing Australians along on the journey with us to understand the risks that they face when there are predatory players in the market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After this decade of denial, delay and neglect, we've had to clean up this mess that was left by the Liberals. We've done more for Australian consumers in just one year than the last government did in nine years. In fact, we've done more in the last fortnight. In this budget, we brought forward an $86.5 million package to combat scams and online fraud, including $58 million for the ACCC to set up the National Anti-Scam Centre. As well as its work bringing together expertise from across government and the private sector to detect and deter scams, the NASC will drive consumer awareness and, importantly, education to ensure that consumers are better able to protect themselves from scams and improve their financial literacy along the way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This package also includes funding to address scam SMSs. They can lead to huge financial losses, as we know. We all know somebody who has been preyed upon in that regard. The fighting scams package will address the massive problem where last year $3 billion was lost to scams by Australians. That's grown fivefold since 2020. The Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments left Australians to fend for themselves against scammers. In particular, they ignored the explosion in scams brought on by the pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Monday, we announced reform to the regulation of 'buy now, pay later' to protect vulnerable consumers from the risks of unregulated credit products and unaffordable lending. These are real interventions being made by the Albanese government, in stark contrast to the failure and neglect of the previous government that is most pertinently exemplified by their trillion dollars of Liberal debt. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I thank him for bringing this motion and I support this motion. This motion concerns education, particularly in the field of financial literacy.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many have spoken about education, probably more elegant eloquently than I will tonight, but there are three particular quotes that I wish to raise. First of all, Nelson Mandela said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will, whilst ever I'm in this place, speak on education whenever I can. I say this, as well, as the daughter of a teacher. My mum, Jan, was a primary school teacher, and I thank her particularly for imbibing in me a lifelong love of learning, something that we as a community should inspire to do in our younger Australians. Teachers are doing this every day.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I first acknowledge the fabulous teachers within my electorate of Hughes and the incredible work they do every day, both within and without the classroom, to educate. I have my good friends, Carolyn Ryder, a primary school teacher from Heathcote, and Murray Collis and Marina Collis, high school teachers from Loftus. As I engage with my electorate, it has been a pleasure and a privilege to meet with leadership teams and students at my local schools. Recently, these are Inaburra School, Como Public School, Shire Christian School, Wattle Grove Public School, Hammondville Public School, Minerva School and St Christopher's Catholic Primary School at Holsworthy and St Joseph's Catholic Primary School at Como. Excellent work is being done at all of these schools. Students are engaged and interested.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Broadly, however, Australia's education standards on the world stage have been declining for many years. We can look at recent NAPLAN results to see that. I know those results have been spoken about in this place, and I don't intend to reiterate all of them. However, we are falling behind. It should also come as no surprise that student enrolments in STEM based subjects are at an all-time low.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When considering financial literacy, a 2021 Reserve Bank of Australia study found that almost two-thirds of year 12 economics students and around 95 per cent of other year 12 students did not preference an economics course for university. But financial literacy is not just about getting into university to study economics. It's not just about becoming an investment banker. It is about empowering our youth to understand, for example, how they budget, how they manage pay as you go, how they understand whether or not they've been paid the right amount, how they can negotiate a car loan or a home loan and how they can ensure that they don't pay a 24 per cent interest rate on their credit cards. Funding alone is not enough to support this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So much of Australia's modern economic growth and prosperity depends on the cultivation of STEM skills in our students, and our education system, as it currently stands, is not providing this. Financial literacy is not just for students wishing to pursue an economics career. It is an important social issue that we empower our youth with the ability to manage their own money. The Albanese Labor government has now been in government for a year, and it's time that they look at what they can do to incentivise other governments to provide financial literacy within our curriculum. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is easing the cost of living and taking the pressure off people living on the Central Coast. Our budget has been carefully calibrated and targeted to ensure relief is provided to those who most need it while not adding to inflation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the Central Coast, Medicare and health are the key issues that constituents call us about. In our budget, Medicare and health were centrepieces, because it is the health of the community that is paramount. As a doctor and as someone who is very passionate about the health care of Australians and the people in our electorate, I am very happy to see this as a focus. In my practice as a doctor and in my service as a parliamentarian, the patient must and will always come first. Our government endeavours to put patients first and to make health care and medications cheaper and easier to access. I have seen first-hand the impact of people not being able to afford health care and not being able to afford their medication.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the significant changes to how medicines are dispensed at pharmacies across the nation have now been announced by the health minister, the Hon. Mark Butler. From 1 September, eligible patients with a Medicare card or with a concession card will be able to be prescribed with 60 days' worth of medicine after consultation with their doctor. This change will mean six million Australians will halve their medicine costs and need fewer visits to the GP and fewer visits to the pharmacist. In Robertson, almost 42,000 people will benefit from our cheaper medicines.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes were recommended by the pharmaceutical benefits advisory committee in 2018. However, the former Liberal government did not act to implement any measures to improve access to health care or access to medication. It is unsurprising that, from the former Liberal government, the member for Riverina, a government that cared little for the health care of Australians. As we saw too often from the previous government, they were more occupied with pork barrelling taxpayer funds for projects that were never built. We also have an opposition leader who once proposed healthcare tax and who oversaw a massive period of neglect of our healthcare system while he was the health minister—attacks on Australians accessing health care, a leap back to the days when health care was unaffordable, a leap back to when it was unable to be accessed by the masses, leading to excessive and unnecessary morbidity and, even worse, mortality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the changes announced in this budget to make medicines cheaper are what other countries already have in place. Examples include New Zealand, Canada, France, where patients have access to multiple-month medications on a prescription. These changes will ensure Australians can purchase two months' worth of medicines on a single script. An aspect of this policy that I want to highlight for the people of the Central Coast is that our veteran community will benefit from this change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government has a proud record of making medicines cheaper for all Australians. On January 1, for the first time in the 75-year history of the PBS, the general co-payment was reduced from $42.50 down to $30. In the first three months, 5.1 million prescriptions have been cheaper, saving more than $58 million. In Robertson, that is $384,102 saved because of the Albanese government's cheaper medicines changes that started this year. On top of the government's cheaper medicines policy, our record $3.5 billion investment into Medicare means more people will be able to access a doctor, because Labor is the party of Medicare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I make this commitment that I will continue to work with all stakeholders in the healthcare space because that is what is required. When these changes were first announced, I was the first federal MP to meet with local pharmacists. I was one of the first local MPs after these changes were announced to meet with local doctors, because that's what is required to progress and to move our country forward positively so that we can create a better future for all. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:14</span>):  Australia's universal healthcare system is one of its greatest assets but last year the <span style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">trengthening Medicare </span><span style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span style="font-style:italic;">askforce report</span> identified a need for clear and simple value propositions for consumers, general practice and other primary care providers. To this end, I have been advocating for GPs to be able to prescribe medications for 12 months at a time, with two months supply, for medically stable patients with chronic medical conditions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This change to the PBS schedule will decrease the need for routine GP and pharmacy visits for many Australians and it will reduce the cost of those medications by halving the dispensing costs. Allowing up to a year's supply of medications on a single prescription will save many patients at least one doctor visit a year, and the two-month supply option will save patients up to $180 per year per medication. Those savings will be particularly valuable for those pensioners and concession card holders who were not helped by the government's recent reduction in PBS co-payments. Concession card holders will save more than $43 per year per medication.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the out-of-pocket cost of medications is a key reason for many Australians delaying or failing to fill some of their prescriptions. The Office of Impact Analysis recently reported that one in five Australians aged 16 to 24 found prescription medications to be unaffordable. In 2021-22, more than 770,000 Australians delayed or didn't fill prescriptions because of cost concerns. Those Australians were more often women. They were more likely to be young people and they were more likely to be affected by long-term health conditions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost of medications is exacerbated by the increasing out-of-pocket cost of GP visits; on average, $47.91 in Kooyong alone. Time spent away from work for those visits and for trips to the pharmacist impacts productivity. Amending PBS guidelines to increase the number of supplies that can be dispensed at each visit will reduce inconvenience to patients. It will cut the cost of dispensing for the patient and for the PBS and will increase the agency of patients in safely managing their own medications. Patients will benefit from a larger supply of medications in one go, with longer dispensing intervals and larger medicine pack sizes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This change is sound policy. It's consistent with the most recent national medicines policy review and it's consistent with the policy of the Department of Health and Aged Care on the quality use of medications. It's been supported by medical and consumer groups. Both the AMA and the Royal Australian College of GPs supported this change when it was proposed first in 2018 and subsequently.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, concerns have been expressed by community pharmacies regarding potential adverse impacts of this change. I'm fully supportive of it being rolled out in tranches to enable those pharmacies to adapt appropriately. It's important that we continue to look to the regions to ensure that those in rural settings have access to the same competitive prices for medications as those in metropolitan settings and that we ensure adequate supply of all medications for all Australians. Pharmacists will benefit from the expanded support for vaccine delivery in the recent budget. They should be appropriately supported for the work that they do, and we should continue to actively consider how we can safely increase their scope of practice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time to cut the red tape. It's time to improve access to medications for all Australians. I'm really proud to have effectively advocated for this important change to pharmaceutical dispensing laws in Australia. It will reduce the need for routine GP visits, it will decrease pharmacy visits for repeat dispensing of medicines and it will lessen the cost of medicines for those people with longstanding medical conditions. We have to continue to critically review continuously all aspects of our healthcare delivery to improve both cost effectiveness and quality of care in all parts of the system. I commend this motion to the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:18</span>):  I'd first of all like to thank my friend the member for Robertson for moving this motion. It is important that we acknowledge the significant achievement that our government has made to deliver cheaper medicines to millions of Australians. The reason that I am in this place is to try to make sure I fulfil my promise to my electorate to make medical care cheaper and more equitable not only across my electorate but across the country. I am very proud to be part of a Labor government that is doing this self-evidently and appropriately in spite of the battles that they are facing against vested interests. I would also like to acknowledge the member for Kooyong, who, indeed, like me has long advocated for extended prescribing times. This will certainly make a huge difference to the way medicines are delivered to some of the most vulnerable Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our cheaper medicines policy came into effect on 1 January this year and reduced the general co-payment for medicines on the PBS from $42.50 down to $30. Besides being a price drop for patients, this is the first time in the 75-year history of the PBS that the general co-payment has been dropped. It's important also, and one of the main reasons for me speaking on this motion, that this will make health care much more equitable for some people, particularly families, who are very vulnerable in this cost-of-living crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I saw firsthand as a paediatrician the disastrous effects of the coalition's ignorant policy on health care in Australia, with a lack of access to GP visits, more expensive medicines, more difficulty for patients to access specialist care and a breakdown in our outpatient system and our public hospitals. This government, the Albanese Labor government, is attempting to change the way that health care is delivered in Australia to a more equitable system. We've had 10 years of neglect and we're not going to fix it all in one budget, but, certainly, the last budget was a huge effort to redress the balance of health care in Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the moment, Australians who are wealthy can access the best health care in the world, but people who are vulnerable, because of either a lack of income or living in rural and regional areas, are really struggling to access health care that sometimes falls to Third-World levels. We see that in our Indigenous populations with conditions, like rheumatic fever, that have been eradicated in virtually every other developed country in the world still being present in some of our Indigenous populations. We see life expectancies for people who live in rural and regional areas persistently being many years below those of people who live in the inner cities and have access to some of the best health care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate, from Rosemeadow to Ruse, from Glen Alpine to Harrington Park, from some of the poorest areas to some of the wealthiest areas, these changes that we have made, not just our prescribing rules but also the changes that came into effect on 1 January, will make a huge difference to the equity of access to health care. I applaud that and I congratulate the health minister, Mark Butler, for doing that. This has resulted in savings already of half a million dollars in Macarthur—amazing—in just a few days.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Going forward, this policy will save Australians more than $1.6 billion over the next four years. If you couple that with the changes to Medicare, the increase in the bulk-billing rebates with the general rebate for a standard GP consultation going up by over 30 per cent, it will make equity of access a really important feature of this first term of the Albanese government. I applaud it. Patients can now halve the number of times they visit a GP for regular medications. They don't have the inconvenience of having to turn up at a pharmacy every 30 days for routine medications that they may well have been stable on for more than 20 years. It's very important for health care in our communities that in the 21st century we make our systems more efficient.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know there are concerns from pharmacies and by pharmacists. I've met with many of them and I understand their concerns, but I would encourage them to come back to the table. There are ways that we can help our pharmacies, particularly in isolated rural and regional areas, like some of the small towns around my electorate. We can look at ways to try and improve their scope of practice. We can look at ways of trying to improve their general practices. But they must come back to the table. This government has done amazingly well, and I'm proud to be part of it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:23</span>):  I do not agree with the motion, but I do find it very difficult to criticise a man who has earned the respect of all in this place and certainly many, if not most, in his own electorate—it would be most, because he keeps getting re-elected! To the member for Macarthur: well done. I have been on trips overseas, and I know that he puts people's health first and foremost, whether they are in Papua New Guinea or here in Australia. I will also acknowledge that I am the only speaker in this debate who is not a doctor. I will acknowledge that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Medical Association would have been very pleased with and proud of the three previous efforts. The AMA, which for some reason did not support a rural medical school network when it was first proposed by—we'll say the National Party, but it was the coalition—remained opposed to it and vehemently opposed the notion of a medical school network. This will put doctors in the bush, getting their training from start to finish. That is going to be a game changer that will be transformational for rural and remote areas.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is about our pharmacists, who in many cases, particularly in remote Australia, are the only frontline medical professionals in those centres. They deserve every bit of support. We've heard members opposite and the member for Kooyong talking about what Labor has done in this space when in government previously, yet I well recall being in my first term, from 2010 to 2013, when Labor took medications off the PBS schedule because they'd run out of money. They'd run out of somebody else's money to put them on, and they took them off the schedule.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Don't just take my word for what is before us tonight. Let's hear from Claire Robertson, a pharmacist proprietor of Blooms the Chemist in Sturt Mall in Wagga Wagga. She says that the 60-day dispensing is likely to increase the current medicine shortage, resulting in patients and community members being unable to access the medication they need. She says it has the potential to result in medicine-hoarding. She says it means there will be more medicines in the home, and this may lead to increased risk of overdose. She says it will exacerbate our already overburdened healthcare system and will impact pharmacies' ability to deliver best-practice healthcare. She's right, of course.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Luke van der Rijt, Michael O'Reilly, Tom Adamson and Darko Bogdanovic, the proprietors of Southcity Pharmacy in Wagga Wagga, said: 'Minister Butler has dismissed this policy as something that won't have an effect on community pharmacy, but as you can see from the numbers,' which they correctly worked out, 'this is, quite frankly, categorically incorrect. I think everyone is now aware that this policy will cause numerous medications to go out of stock. Even if the medication is available, the pharmacy will be under such financial pressure that they won't have the cashflow to hold stock for the community. Wait times to get prescriptions will blow out to days.'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Victor Vo is a small-business owner of two pharmacies in Ariah Park in the Riverina electorate, a rural town located in the Temora Shire and Ardlethan. He is absolutely concerned about equitable, timely, safe and affordable access to high-quality and reliable supply of medicines and medicines-related services for all Australians, and with ensuring that medicines are used safely, optimally and judiciously, with a focus on informed choice and well-coordinated person-centred care. Yet he is very concerned that this policy does not achieve the objectives that he sets out to do as a health professional and, indeed, that probably even the government would like to perform.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wendy Patey is a constituent from Boree Creek and Lockhart Shire and therefore the Riverina electorate. She phoned my office to say that this policy is 'ludicrous'. She fears it will lead to the closure of the small pharmacy at Urana, and if that happened the people of Boree Creek would have to drive to Lockhart or Narrandera to have their prescription filled. Diane McGill from Pleasant Hills in New South Wales is also very concerned and wrote to us with some very personal issues about the medication that she is on. She is also concerned for her local friendly pharmacist.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken to Trent Twomey from the Pharmacy Guild and he, like many, is very concerned that this is going to force the closure—they say—of chemists, who provide such a valuable service, particularly in rural, regional and remote Australia. I ask the government to reconsider this.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:29</span>):  Member for Riverina, you're not the only non-doctor contributing to this debate; I am now contributing. I'm not a doctor, but I am a significant consumer of the health system. I don't want any sympathy for that, but I want to say that I absolutely understand why this policy helps people who need medicine and are on medicine for chronic illnesses. I absolutely understand when the minister talks about the greatest risk of noncompliance with medicine being when your script runs out. If you have to fill a script every month, what that actually means is that every 3½ weeks you need to remember to go to the pharmacy to fill your script before your medicine runs out, or you have four or five days without it. It will make a massive difference not just financially to patients but to their health care and to their lives.</span>
