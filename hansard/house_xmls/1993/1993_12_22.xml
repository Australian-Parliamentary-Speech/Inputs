It is appropriate that, in the passing of it, this parliament this day will do more, and will have done more, to return to the Aboriginal people of this country their own soil.

         Mr Chairman, just on a year ago I launched the International Year for the World's Indigenous People at Redfern. During that speech I raised the opportunity presented by the High Court's decision in the Mabo case and reiterated my view that this presented a huge opportunity for Australia; that here we had a basis for reconciliation formerly denied us but that we had to seize the opportunity and build a body of social, property and administrative law around the High Court decision which would then provide a basis in land for indigenous Australians to participate more fully in this society, and to do something real and material about a genuine basis of reconciliation.

         As it happens the government campaigned on this issue, among others, in the election campaign. It won the election and then it set about systematically developing the lines of logic and principle that ought to lie behind a comprehensive piece of social and property legislation like this when it is brought to the parliament. It has probably been the most worked over piece of legislation in the 11-year history of the Labor government, and it saw the devotion of more ministerial and bureaucratic time than any other piece of legislation in the period. Also there was a round of consultations with the various stakeholders and interested parties—most particularly the Aboriginal people, for whom the bill was designed, but also the states, the farmers and graziers, the mining industry, and all of the other groups that have an interest in Aboriginal policy and who are interested in development.

         The bill has sought to meet the twin goals of justice for Aboriginal people and the establishment of a workable system of land management. This the bill does. It gives to Aboriginal people the right to have claims for native title heard and awarded in a stream of the Federal Court of Australia and in the state supreme courts, and it gives to the states and state institutions the power to make economic decisions over native title land. We believe that these mechanisms will serve the country well in allowing the great rural and mining industries of this country to grow and prosper while at the same time maintaining a position of harmony with the interests of Aboriginal people.

         The lesson of Mabo is that we should never underestimate our capacities for solving our problems. We should take this legislation to be a victory for all Australians and the Australian nation because it is a profound event. It should mark a new spirit of faith and optimism in Australia that something of this complexity can in fact be mastered and agreed.

         The difference between the opposition and the Labor government is on this subject, as it has always been—Mabo has made this clear: the opposition represents the politics of pessimism and despair; we say there is every reason to be optimistic. The opposition presumes ill will among Australians; we presume goodwill. The opposition can only talk of national disaster; we talk of national success. The opposition believes in property rights only for some; we believe in property rights for all, including indigenous Australians.

         One might be tempted to dwell on the abysmal role that the opposition has played in this debate, for never has a political opposition exhibited less vision, less principle or less faith in the people of Australia and their democratic institutions. Never has an opposition shown less leadership or been so badly led. But this is not a day for political retribution. I dare say, Mr Chairman, in due course, the Australian people will make their judgment on the opposition's dismal role in this great national achievement, as the Liberal Party, no doubt, will soon make its judgment on the dismal role of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson).

         This is a day to celebrate the powerful, creative forces which conceived and brought to fruition this historic legislation. I mean those people and their organisations who imagined there might be a solution to the problem and who had the strength of will, the determination to succeed, the intelligence to negotiate and to argue the case, and the good feelings towards one another to make sure their hopes were realised. This was displayed across the political system and the social fabric of the country—bar the opposition.

In the bill the government has made provision for the acquiring of pastoral leases and their conversion to native title. The government will be introducing a social justice package next year amongst which we will have a land acquisition fund, the purpose of which will be to allow Aboriginal people to buy pastoral leases and to convert them into a native title. Of course, that land will attach all the negotiating rights which obtain with native title land under the bill. This will mean that Aboriginal people will not only simply acquire a pastoral lease which is no more than simply a pastoral lease but underneath that pastoral lease will then sit a native title.

In the event that a state government or a state minister believes a certain development should proceed, that development can proceed with a very clear override provision by states, for states, in the legislation. But, of course, that is for development. In terms of the validation of past titles, the bill validates the titles issued after the Racial Discrimination Act was introduced in 1975 and makes clear that those titles issued between 1975 and 1992 are valid.

         —In response to recommendations by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, the government proposed amendments to provide for a parliamentary joint committee to monitor and review the operations of this bill. This is a unique piece of legislation and a formal monitoring mechanism seems appropriate. There was also an amendment to provide for the Aboriginal Social Justice Commissioner to provide a yearly report on the operations of the act and its effect on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. There were also amendments to provide for the renewal of existing valid leases. These amendments were not the government's preferred option for dealing with this issue but, in the absence of any support from the opposition, there was a need for a compromise. The amendments, we believe, are workable.

In the course of the Senate debate the government has accepted the amendments I mentioned and some other amendments which we think strengthen the bill—a consequence of the whole debate which saw, firstly, the presentation of a discussion paper by the government just after mid-year. Then consultations followed with the Aboriginal community and with the various stakeholders and the states saw the presentation of a draft bill. The draft bill was then circulated for comment. We took the comments on board from the states, the mining industry, the farming and grazing communities and the National Farmers Federation. We took those to cabinet and amended the bill as we thought it should be and then produced a bill.

         The coalition vested everything in the notion that native title ought to be extinguished and that state parliaments ought to be able to hand out a statutory title conferred on Aboriginal people at the whim and caprice of ministers.

In the end, the duplicity of the coalition is highlighted by the fact that it believes in the rule of law except when the High Court says something it does not like.

He also wanted to deny Aboriginal people proprietary title, to give them no proprietary rights but simply a set of rights which were not to be defined and which could be tested only in a dispute. And the coalition is talking about the amount of land which will be alienated from Australia, as if native title in some way will remove the land and the pastoralists from this continent.

It was a very simple issue.

         —We are not going to be part of any massive power grab—more power for Keating and more power for Canberra—at the expense of the states, which is what this legislation is. This legislation is a massive attempt to undermine an essential element of our constitution and our federal system of government, that land management is primarily a state responsibility.

         This is all part of the Keating agenda to undermine the constitution and to undermine the structure of the federal system. It is all part of more power for Keating at the expense of the states. We are prepared to stand up for the constitution and ensure that the states continue to maintain that responsibility for land management in Australia. But they have to do that under two constraints: firstly, they have to do that by recognising native title and, secondly, they have to do that subject to the Racial Discrimination Act.

         So what the Prime Minister was just standing up here saying about us wanting to extinguish native title is wrong. All we want to do is ensure that we have a simple, direct, just and workable response to this particular decision of the High Court, and that is what is possible—not one that goes dramatically beyond the High Court decision, not one that raises a whole lot of other issues and transfers a whole lot of other rights that were not envisaged in the original High Court decision, but simply a structure that will work, that will be fair, that will be just and that will not have the adverse economic and social consequences that this legislation will have.

         Our case against this legislation is very clear. We are going to vote against it basically for one reason; that is, it is bad legislation. It is bad legislation for a number of reasons. It is bad legislation because it goes way beyond the High Court decision; it is bad legislation because it creates enormous complexity, delay, uncertainty and division in Australian society; it is bad legislation because it takes a mistaken view of the root cause of Aboriginal and Islander disadvantage; it is bad legislation because without good reason it constrains the future opportunities for national development to the detriment of all Australians and creates future financial liabilities, the scale of which nobody can predict.

         The Prime Minister has done a deal to save his political hide. He has done a deal and he has capitulated to the left wing of his party. After the budget he was persona non grata in his party; this guy was dead, he was sacrificed. The honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) was sacrificed and the Prime Minister was put on notice—`Deliver to the Left or you won't remain in a job'. What you have got is a total capitulation to the left wing of the ALP and a deal stitched up between the Prime Minister, the left wing of his party, a pastoral leader and the minority parities in the Senate—all to the detriment of most Australians.

There was a statement made this week by all but one state leader opposed to this legislation, seeking delay. He has sold out the miners, he has sold out the farmers, he has sold out the state leaders and he has sold out all other Australians who are going to be significantly worse off as a result of this legislation going through this parliament.

         The bottom line of his approach is that his system is not workable. It will result in massive delay in major development projects right around Australia and could well be the fundamental turning point for the mining industry. He has already heard major miners in this country saying that they will move their exploration activity offshore. One major miner has already told me that, as a result of this legislation, he does not believe he will see another new mine open in Australia. The bottom line for average Australians is lost jobs, lost investment and lost export opportunities. He is sacrificing the interests of all Australians for his own tawdry political ends. He has done a deal which is the low watermark of deal doing in this country, when he consciously and knowingly set out to divide Australia for his own political ends at the expense of the interests of all Australians.

         Mr Chairman, the coalition is proud of the position we have taken on this bill on behalf of the people of Australia. We will continue to give voice to the concern, anger and disillusionment of Australians over a Prime Minister who has so visibly lost touch. As we made the point last week, he has now embraced something of an imperial or regal lifestyle which is totally divorced from what those true believers he claims to represent can identify with. He stands up in this place and elsewhere in Australia, puts his hand over his heart, says he stands by Chifley and other Labor leaders of the past, mouths the rhetoric of Chifley and then goes out and lives a lifestyle and pursues interests that are totally divorced from the lifestyle and interests of the people he claims to represent, and people out there see this Mabo legislation as part of that pattern.

         What on earth is he on about? He has lost control. He is selling out to minority interests at the expense of the rest of us and dividing the nation for his own political ends. How can this man be so out of touch? How can he be so out of touch with the interests and aspirations of the people of Australia? Perhaps most disturbing is that a lot of Aboriginal people woke up this morning knowing that they will get nothing directly out of this. For example, nothing will happen to remove the disadvantage in their education; nothing will come out of this to remove the disadvantage in their mortality rates or illiteracy rates, or in their lack of housing opportunities or lack of job opportunities.

They cannot understand why their educational opportunities are so much more restricted than they are for other Australians. They cannot understand why their job opportunities are so much more restricted, or why it is so much harder for their kids to get a job or to get an education, or why their mortality rates are so far out of line with the rest of Australia. They cannot understand why the Prime Minister does not seem to understand the basic needs and aspirations of Aboriginal people, let alone the rest of Australia.

To the Aboriginal negotiators, to the late Eddie Mabo and others who made this possible, I salute you. The Racial Discrimination Act involves everybody. We live in a pluralist society. It is our bill of rights. It keeps us equal. If we suspended the Racial Discrimination Act against the Aboriginals, who next—the Chinese, the Lebanese, the Vietnamese, the Jews? The Racial Discrimination Act is law. The High Court has upheld it.

         —I am glad that the government has accepted the amendments in relation to the Social Security (Budget and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill. The first matter relates to the mature age allowance. In my view the amendments are quite sensible because they ensure that people who receive a mature age allowance and undertake part-time work will be able, if they lose that work, to go back on the mature age allowance rather than having to receive other forms of benefit that are available to the unemployed.

         In relation to the compensation recovery arrangements, the opposition has agreed to the majority of the provisions that the government has sought to enact. But we have moved to delete from the bill those compensation measures which deal with the question of excluding from benefits those who receive a compensation payment to replace lost income or future income earning capacity. We wanted to do so because the particular measure, as it is intended to operate, will characterise all compensation payments as 50 per cent economic loss related. The impact of such a provision would be that a beneficiary might
        </tab>
       </para>

        suffer a significant preclusion period as a result of the compensation being characterised as 50 per cent for economic loss.

         That could mean, for instance, that an invalid or age pensioner who was involved in a motor vehicle accident and received a small compensation payment for pain and suffering or out of pocket medical expenses would have part of that payment characterised as 50 per cent economic loss related. There would be a preclusion period for that person being able then to obtain social security benefit.

         While there are discretionary provisions in the existing law which allow the government to make a decision to grant a person an ex gratia payment, the fact is that the way in which those provisions have been construed—this has been confirmed by the courts—has meant that a person would not be able to get the discretion exercised that is available unless there were new guidelines.

         The government tells us that the guidelines are very complex and difficult to draft. I do not believe it is beyond the wit of parliamentary counsel to come up with appropriate guidelines for advising officers on the exercise of a discretion. If the government is given time, it will come up with an appropriate set of guidelines for implementation of the discretion. So, for that reason, we have deleted all of the provisions at this time; but, if the government brings back fresh provisions along with appropriate guidelines for administering discretion, obviously we will be prepared to look at this measure again.

         In relation to the movement of 16-year-olds from Austudy to family payments, the opposition took the view that this measure would have quite a significant impact, particularly on families, because the measure was designed to save the government money, which it can do only by reducing the support available. It does this by applying different assets and income tests. Our view is that the measure would disadvantage families, particularly rural families. We opposed it and we are pleased that the other parties, the Australian Democrats in particular, joined us in opposing that particular measure.

         The final matter relates to data matching. The government sought removal of the sunset clause that brought data matching to an end. We would have been prepared to look at these provisions more realistically if the government had been able to produce evidence that data matching was achieving the outcomes originally foreshadowed. The government expected savings of the order of $300 million from data matching. In the end, in net terms, a mere $3 million saving has been demonstrated in the most recent reports of the Auditor-General who has examined this matter.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         At this time it is appropriate to deal with the data matching by ensuring that the sunset clause presently in place—which would have seen the provisions expire on 22 January 1994—remains in place but with the substitution of a new sunset date of 22 January 1996. This is an appropriate response which gives the government flexibility in future years to move in relation to this matter. But it ensures continuing reports on the adequacy of the data matching regime and it leaves open the option of having the sunset clause operate if it is demonstrated that the data matching has not realised the objectives set for it.

         —We have already wasted one minute. I briefly wanted to address clauses 88 and 89 of the Social Security (Budget and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill because what the government originally intended to do would have had a detrimental effect on some 136,000 students and their families in Australia, and particularly those in regional and rural Australia. It would have halved the assets test that applied to these payments, from some $730,000 to $360,000; reduced the maximum income from some $30,000 to $24,000; and reduced the maximum payment from $129 a fortnight to $121 a fortnight. This was in light of the government's own policy statement that it would `make continuing improvements to the Austudy schemes of student support'. This was not an improvement. It was clearly detrimental to the interests of a whole range of families, particularly in regional and rural Australia. In a week in which the government brings out a report on trying to maximise and improve opportunities for regional Australia, this provision stood in marked contrast. So we on this side are glad the government has finally seen the light on these measures.

         —The amendments to the Social Security Amendment Bill (No.2) attempt to bring student parents' income for testing purposes for family payments into line with the tests that apply to all others. Unfortunately, the government did not take into account that some people had planned on receiving incomes which included postgraduate awards which, if this test had applied, would have excluded a number of people from receiving family payments even though they had included that very carefully in their budgeting. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that this provision has no retrospective application. We think it is a sensible measure and support it.

         The ombudsman tabled a report this week which suggested to the government a number of matters that needed urgent remedying. I simply draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) to the fact that, while the department has been busily drafting amendments designed to save revenue where there is a small cost to the revenue of ensuring fairness and equity, those sorts of amendments do not seem to have been on our agenda to date. So I would encourage the parliamentary secretary and the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) to ensure that those sorts of matters are addressed when we have further social security legislation before the House.

        (7) There will be inevitable dislocation and disruption associated with the relocation of the Industry Commission. However, I am confident that the relocation will assist the Commission in fulfilling its enhanced role of investigating opportunities for growth and employment in specified industries, via its Industry Development Inquiries. The adoption of an Industry Development approach, together with the move of the Commission to Melbourne, heralds a new phase in the Commission's continuing valuable contribution to the microeconomic reform process in Australia.

The Department of the Arts and Administrative Services is examining this and other issues relating to purchasing statistics, with assistance from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.

The greater part of this is accounted for by fuel, paper, tyres and furniture. Similarly, over 80 per cent of DASFLEET's expenditure on vehicles of $175 million per annum is domestic.

       The power to regulate the acquisition and possession of firearms lies with the States and Territories. At the Premiers meeting on 22 December 1987 all jurisdictions, with the exception of Tasmania, requested the Australian Police Ministers Council (APMC) to give further consideration to a number of issues related to gun control. A special meeting of the APMC was held in March 1988. Although the meeting passed a number of resolutions aimed at controlling the ownership and use of firearms, progress towards achieving uniformity of approach between jurisdictions has proved difficult. It has proved impossible to achieve the broad agreement which the Commonwealth regards as essential to the effectiveness of legislation in all jurisdictions. However, the Commonwealth is committed to continuing to work through the APMC to encourage the further development of a national approach.

       The Department of Defence considers that the legislation governing rifle clubs is an anachronistic and unnecessary use of defence powers. In 1988 the Minister for Defence approved repeal of the relevant legislation (the Australian Rifle Club Regulations) but the repeal was disallowed by the Senate. Since then the Department of Defence has been in negotiation with the two peak councils of rifle clubs towards achieving a common view on the jurisdiction that should govern rifle shooting as a sport. To date agreement has not been reached and negotiations are continuing.

       The Department believes that there is no sound basis for legislation governing firearms in rifle clubs to be separate from legislation governing all other firearms.

       This Recommendation needs further clarification. The word `automatic' is sometimes ambiguous. If it means `fully automatic' then the present Northern Territory Firearms Act covers this. If it means `semi-automatic' then the new Firearms Act does not go as far as recommended. Semi automatic rifles are highly restricted, but not prohibited. However, the recommendation goes beyond rifles and includes shot guns. Semi automatic shot guns are not often seen in criminal activities. Any move to restrict them would be very strongly opposed by interest groups. The new Firearms Act removes numerous loopholes in the restriction of `D' class firearms, for example, semi-automatic rifles. Also note that ammunition is restricted under the Dangerous Goods Act. The Recommendation does not make it clear what types of ammunition are to be prohibited.

       The Recommendation that pistols be `stored on the premises' is also of dubious merit.

Balanced against that is the fact that such `premises' will be unattended for most nights and some days, leaving the pistols at risk of theft. Given that licensees are subject to considerable scrutiny, it may be preferable to allow pistols to be kept in owners' homes.

       On 22 May 1993 the Australasian Police Ministers' Council (APMC) considered a report from the Police Commissioners' Policy Advisory Group (PCPAG) on guidelines for police use of lethal force, which had been prepared in response to this recommendation. The guidelines were modelled, as far as possible, on the UN Guidelines `Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials'. Where appropriate, however, prevailing local guidelines were preferred where their standard exceeded that adopted by the United Nations. The APMC resolved to adopt the guidelines as minimum national standards on the use of firearms and other lethal force by police. They form the basis of operational instructions for individual police jurisdictions throughout the country. These minimum guidelines are able to be built on if necessary by individual jurisdictions in their administrative and operational procedures.

In the event that firearms are used, guidelines clearly outline members' responsibilities to assist and ensure medical aid is rendered promptly.

        (5) &amp; (6) There is no program which results in participants being automatically excluded from the scope of the ABS Labour Force Survey. How participants are classified for the purposes of that survey depends on how they interpret their situation when responding to survey questions. Questions are asked independently of any participation in labour market programs. Questions focus on whether the person was available for work or did any work in the week before the interview and their efforts to find work in the month before the interview.

        The responses of survey participants engaged in labour market programs are likely to vary according to the nature of the program in question. Thus participants in subsidised employment and work experience programs such as JOBSTART, the Employment Incentive Scheme, the Landcare and Environment Action Program (LEAP), JOBSKILLS and the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NEIS) would probably regard themselves as being in work and, therefore, be classified as employed. By contrast, participants in programs such as Job Clubs or Job Search Training courses would probably consider themselves as looking for work and consequently be classified as unemployed.

        I have considered the reports from the Services and Structures Review and agreed to the nineteen Area configuration proposed, including the location of the Area's administrative office in Upper Mount Gravatt. I have also agreed that elements of the Area Coastal's administrative office should be outposted to Lismore in an Area Coastal (Northern New South Wales) Office. It has been decided to expand the Student Assistance Centre in Lismore and to open a new Regional Development Office.

        Positive program outcomes can be reported on the basis of DEET Areas and Regions. However, given that the geographically smaller regions may have low numbers of clients on individual programs and that program monitoring survey response rates can vary between regions, the comparative value of regional data is limited. While comparisons of outcomes at Area level are more reliable, similar restrictions may apply.

Each table contains data for a particular labour market program on the proportion of persons completing programs in 1991-92 and 1992-93 who obtained unsubsidised jobs, further (non-DEET) education or training places, and positive outcomes in total. As some participants obtain both unsubsidised employment and a further education or training place, the proportion achieving positive outcomes in total may be less than the sum of proportions for the two component categories of outcome.

        (a) The brief was for cleaning of sewers, including root cutting and foaming, and closed-circuit television investigations of those parts of the sewers not covered by earlier surveys. It included preparation of a report detailing the scope of remedial and maintenance work required, and a suggested phasing of the remedial work, to assist with maintenance priorities and financial planning.

        (c) Results of a restricted survey of the sewer system, to confirm its capacity to accommodate new developments, indicated that sewers were in poor condition, in need of cleaning, unblocking, root removal and renewal in many places. A full clean and survey was therefore considered to be a high priority to determine the condition of all sewers and extent of remedial maintenance required, noting the potential for hygiene and environmental problems if a major failure or blockage occurred.

        (1) No. The budget for the campaign was $605 000, covering activity in financial years 1992-93 and 1993-94. The budget was funded jointly by DPIE and DFAT from within existing running costs. Pending finalisation of accounts, as at 15 December 1993 expenditure was $590 000.

Lobbying host country governments on such matters is one of the normal priorities of diplomatic representation, therefore these costs have been met from the running costs of Australia's overseas missions.

        The FAO campaign supported Australia's international objectives in three important areas: agricultural trade, reform of the UN system and refocussing international development assistance. The campaign made a useful contribution in these three areas, even though it was ultimately unsuccessful. The quality and integrity of the candidature and the campaign reflected well upon Australia. Dr Miller was the last candidate to be beaten, in the sixth ballot after 9 hours of balloting. Candidates from Greece, Ireland, Bangladesh, Holland, Germany, India and Chile were defeated or withdrew before the final runoff between Dr Miller and the eventual winner, Dr Diouf from Senegal. If ten countries had changed sides, the Australian candidate would have won. Thus the defeat was extremely narrow. This international candidature was publicly endorsed by both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. Also representations in support of Dr Miller were made in overseas countries by the Leader of the National Party.
