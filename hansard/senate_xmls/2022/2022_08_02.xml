                <span class="HPS-Normal">Archie Roach didn't just make music. He gave an enduring voice to the hurt and hope felt by a generation of Australians. It's a voice that will remain etched in the minds of many Australians and also the consciousness of this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Roach was born at the Framlingham Aboriginal mission in Victoria. He was removed from his family at a young age as part of the stolen generations. He was separated from his mother, a Gunditjmara woman, and his father, a Bundjalung man from New South Wales. Uncle passed through several foster homes before he was finally settled with the Cox family. He acknowledged this family as having taken care of him well. He learned the basics of keyboard and guitar from his foster sister, Mary Cox. Uncle was too young to understand his situation, like many other members of the stolen generations, and he was left to assume that biological parents of his had already passed away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the truth about his forced removal from his family was discovered when he was a teenager, in a letter from a sister he didn't know that he had. It brought news of the very recent death of his mother. The revelation further complicated issues of mental health, identity and belonging, and is understood to have contributed to his falling into the streets with alcohol and other issues and periods of homelessness. It's to these stories of struggle, of finding his sense of self and identity, that he dedicated his life in song and story.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While living on the streets, Uncle met Ruby Hunter, a Ngarrindjeri woman from South Australia. He credits her as his saviour and his sounding board. She was also a talented musician and a member of the stolen generations. I know at one point she apparently saw Uncle in the studio audience on the Happy Hammond show when they were both kids and said to her foster mum, 'I'm going to marry that boy one day,' and so she did. They were partners in life and music for over three decades. Uncle was reluctant to make his first album, but it was dear Ruby who encouraged him to pursue the challenge. She told him: 'It's not all about you, you know. How many blackfellas do you reckon get to record an album?' They were soulmates, and they embarked on a journey of healing through music. Years later, when they were married with a family of their own, their house would remain open to disadvantaged young people in need of the support they themselves had found in each other. He brought people together through his storytelling and music. I guess in some respects he held up a mirror to our country, a mirror that still is there and continues to be there, because his songs are there and continue to be there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last time I saw Uncle was before COVID, here in Canberra. He performed here, and it was so good to see him. I think then I realised just how much of a journey it still had been for him since Aunty Ruby had passed away. It took him a while to get back on his feet and back out singing after she passed, but he was there singing strong here on Ngunnawal and Ngambri country. Despite all of that—the hurt, the struggles, the pain—he was still reaching out to all of us in the audience, all of us who came to listen to him sing, reminding us, 'Look out for others, you don't know the footsteps and the journey that other people have walked, and, no matter how difficult your road, always look out for others.' That was a message I found firmly stayed with me throughout my life in knowing him. I think of his family and his children in particular, and I say thank you for sharing him with us, with the broader First Nations community, with Australia, with the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to finish with the song 'Took the Children Away', which resonated across Australia and internationally. Just one song, like all of his songs, telling the stories of pain but also, incredibly, of hope and healing coming from the stolen generations. He reflected in the opening of the song:</span>

                  </a>  Thank you. The silence across this nation is deafening from the passing of a beautiful soul—a beautiful uncle, grandfather, father, brother, son—of Gunditjmara, of Djab Wurrung, of Keerray Woorroong, of my people. Framlingham Mission is where Uncle Archie came from. It was tough on Framlingham Mission in those days. Our people were given rations. Our people were treated like animals on mission reserves around this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Uncle Archie Roach was a baby on Framlingham Mission, where he was born. He was treated like an animal because of the colour of his skin. He was disrespected by the society he lived in. He was taunted with racism for most of his life. But he's fighting Gunditjmara, and he got through those difficult times at Framlingham Mission, where my grandmothers grew up, where my grandmothers come from and where my grandmothers were a part of Uncle Archie's care and love.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was stolen from Framlingham Mission. He was a stolen Aboriginal child in this country. He wrote songs about being stolen, which everybody listens to. They love putting on Uncle Archie's healing, soulful music. The story behind the man and the song goes so much deeper than putting on his CD or turning on the radio. His story in song was a call to this nation to stop stealing our babies, because his babies were also at risk of being stolen—his two beautiful sons, Amos and Eban, whom I've seen grow up with beautiful love and care from community and his beautiful parents, Uncle Archie and Aunty Ruby.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They were a dynamite couple when I was growing up in Fitzroy. Everyone loved Uncle Archie and Aunty Ruby. He'd sing in the park, with the parkies, with his guitar. He even sang at my 21st with Aunty Ruby, because he's family. He wasn't that famous when he played at my 21st, but I'll claim it!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just hope that a condolence motion also means that people are listening to the heartache and the pain that this man endured all his life. He turned that around. He put it into words of music and song to share with the rest of the country, to learn and to heal from. Aunty Ruby was his backbone, and, when she passed, a piece of Uncle Archie went with her. They were inseparable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to pay my respects to Aunty Diana and Aunty Myrtle. Aunty Myrtle still lives in the public housing unit in Collingwood; Archie's sister still struggles with the day-to-day life of being black in this country. Uncle Archie's family aren't immune to how this country treats First Nations people, and I know Uncle Archie was proud of me getting into the Victorian senate and of me getting in here. I know that because he told me. I know that because I'm still connected to his boys, and the intergenerational trauma of being stolen from your mother when you were four years of age never, ever ends. The symptoms that you all call 'issues'—'Aboriginal issues'—are symptoms of colonisation; stealing children was part of the plan to colonise this country, so we could lose our language, our identity, our connection to country, our connection to totem and our connection to song and dance. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I pay my respects to the absolute resilience and warrior man that was, and still is, Uncle Archie. Next time you put on Uncle Archie's music, remember his story—and remember that his story is happening today, that it will happen tomorrow and that it will happen the next day. Unless everyone in this chamber is willing to change that, it will continue forever. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So no more stealing children. Let's ensure that Uncle Archie's legacy and fight didn't go unheard. Let's continue his legacy, to ensure that no more children are stolen from their mothers' arms in this country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:17</span>):  Let me congratulate you, Deputy President, on your esteemed position. I haven't had the chance to do so. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Archie Roach touched the lives of so many people, Indigenous and non-Indigenous. I dubbed him the poet warrior of our nation, for his songs, his sound and his integrity. His artistic talent would always be greater and more enduring than the efforts of any orator. His haunting lyrics are the work of a modern poet laureate. Archie was a special storyteller and a captivating performer. His voice expressed his stories so powerfully. When I listen to his songs, I hear the dimensions of his life and his experiences, and I am always moved. When I listen to his songs, his voice transports me to places all over—to stories to our country and its past, to hard times and to loss but also to hope. Such is the power of his great gift to us all. This great and powerful gift, Archie's voice telling those stories in his songs, will grow only more relevant and more powerful as time goes on. They are songs that have been the soundtrack to our lives, to key moments and memories, and in that way they have become part of us and our stories. It is difficult to express how important an impact that is, and, because of it, he will never be forgotten and he will never be truly gone. We will always play his music and share his songs and remember and think of Archie and the great and lasting impact he has had on us and on our country. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know the words, the melody and the rhythm of what may be his best work known to us: 'Took the Children Away'. He himself was taken away in 1959, at the age of three, from his biological parents, who were living at Framlingham in Victoria, as Senator Thorpe has mentioned. No wonder he was able to write with such depth of feeling, such empathy and understanding, the lyrics, those words, in 'Took the Children Away', in a song about Melbourne-born Aboriginal man Russell Moore, who died just over a year ago in a Florida jail. During the royal commission we tried, through the American authorities, to get Russell returned to our country. We were unsuccessful in our efforts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Russell was a member of the stolen generation. He had served 30 years in jail before his death, having been convicted of murder, robbery and sexual assault. An Australian lawyer, Richard Bourke, who lives and practises in Florida, was a tireless advocate for Russell Moore to be transferred to his home country here in Australia. Russell Moore's birth mother, Beverly Whyman, from Swan Hill, also spent many years campaigning for her son to be returned to Australia, until her death in 2017. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">My own memories of Archie Roach are focused back in my home country in Broome. I remember sitting under a bower shed at my home with Archie, and with us were Mr Bill Johnson and the late British actor Pete Postlethwaite. Archie and Pete had been on a journey of discovery in the Kimberley. They'd camped out in the desert with the Ngurra native title claimants and witnessed the senior leaders paint a huge canvas depicting their desert country. At night the elders sang the songs of that country and its significance—a huge experience for both Pete and Archie at the time. They walked across the old Fitzroy River at the Fitzroy Crossing and heard the stories of Jandamarra, the famous Bunuba warrior, and his deeds against the encroaching pastoralists and the police posses out to kill him because he had shot one of them. These were the stories of the killing times in the Kimberley being told to Archie and Pete. These travels were undertaken after meeting in Perth with Bill and his family and learning of the brutal murder of Bill's adopted Aboriginal son, Louis St John Johnson, by British backpackers, who used a vehicle instead of horses in the killing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bill and Pete had been friends together in England and had accidentally met in Perth when Pete was out here doing a play. We were all working on a documentary called <span style="font-style:italic;">Liyarn Ngarn</span>, for how the two stories of our encounters with each other might become as one and free us from our ignorance, our fears and our prejudices. We were trying to expose truth about events in our historical and contemporary relationships. We involved the AFL legend Michael Long and his reflections upon his courageous walk from Melbourne to Canberra. Michael had attended so many funerals and so many Sorry Days, and he put the question to Prime Minister Howard: 'Where is the love for my people, Prime Minister?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Archie had composed yet another song for the documentary. It was 'Liyarn Ngarn'. He sang it for us. Its underpinning plea was that we come together because we were already too far apart. As on many occasions when Archie sang, there was not a dry eye in that location. Again, allow me the indulgence of quoting a few lines from the lyrics of 'Liyarn Ngarn':</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">How tragic that Archie passed away so young, at just 66 years old. It's not just another premature death of an Aboriginal person; gone is a wonderful, creative spirit. Gone is a great storyteller who knew how to touch the hearts and the souls—the conscience—of our nation, and how those words of Archie in 'Liyarn Ngarn' have a special resonance now as we move towards implementation of the Uluru Statement from the Heart. Archie already believed the time had come, to be one, to be one. The generosity embedded in the Uluru statement is matched by the readiness of Archie Roach to understand, to stimulate, to lift us up to a better place. Guliya, my friend.</span>

For a moment, time stood still on Saturday evening when I got the news. I want to indulge the Senate with just a little bit of information and honour Senator Thorpe, Senator McCarthy and Senator Dodson's words as well.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Archie Roach was born in central Victoria in a small town on 8 January 1956. He was the youngest of seven siblings, and his mother was Nellie Austin, a Gunditjmara woman from south-west Victoria. His father was Archie Roach Sr, a Bundjalung man from the North Coast of New South Wales. At only four years old, Uncle Archie and two of his sisters were forcibly removed from their parents. As Senator Thorpe says—and I echo this—they were stolen from their parents. Uncle Archie was put in the child protection system by the state and into foster care with Scottish immigrants.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the age of 14, Uncle Archie found out about his First Nations heritage through a letter from his sister. Upon learning this, he left his foster family to find his real family. Uncle Archie spent years travelling and living on the streets, and while spending some time in Adelaide at the Salvation Army's People's Palace he met the wonderful and beautiful woman Aunty Ruby Hunter. Aunty Ruby was also a member of the Stolen Generations, and together they forged a life of music and raised a family with many children of their own, including their sons, Amos and Eban, as well as their foster children, Kriss, Arthur and Terrence. They also supported many young people over the years. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Uncle Archie was a songman, a guitarist and a writer. His rich and extensive career spanned nine albums, a soundtrack, compilations, a children's storybook about the Stolen Generations, a memoir and a poetry book. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over 25 years ago Uncle Archie Roach wrote and released his debut album, <span style="font-style:italic;">Charcoal Lane</span>, which included his story, 'Took the Children Away'. 'Took the Children Away' shed light on the impact for First Nations children who were forcibly removed and deliberately taken from their parents by police, governments and church missions. His song received an international human rights achievement award—the first time the award has ever been bestowed on a songwriter, and well deserved. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Pain can also bring about change in one's life for the better. We can choose to ignore the pain until it becomes unbearable, or we can do something about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can relate to the words Uncle Archie sang in his song, 'Took the Children Away', through my own family's history as members of the Stolen Generations and, in fact, five generations of Stolen Generations. His music represented vibrational healing for First Nations people. And although our pain is sometimes so insurmountable, pain that is unable to be put into words, Uncle Archie put that pain into song and into music which brought it to a whole other level. His words were part of the healing journey for lots of Stolen Generations people, and they've been the subject of many conversations I've had over the years with my elders. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2008 Uncle Archie performed the 'Took the Children Away' song in Federation Square after former Prime Minister Rudd delivered the National Apology to the Stolen Generations. This song was so powerful for so many. It was the cornerstone of his truth-telling to this nation and amplified the apology. We saw a First Nations man be able to give his own personal recollection and story, which enabled the voice for so many across this nation. This remains true right up until today. We can still see children being removed today, as Senator Thorpe has already mentioned, which is the ongoing legacy of colonialism in this country. The apology was only one part of it, and we still have so much work to do. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Uncle Archie was a recognised leader in the community, and in 2014 he established the Archie Roach Foundation to nurture meaningful and life-changing opportunities for First Nations artists. The foundation seeks to walk alongside those working in the arts, and young people heading down the wrong track, to support them to be the best that they can be. Two years ago, Uncle Archie launched the Archie Roach Stolen Generations Resources—a free package of educational support materials, developed by First Nations curriculum writers, to teach young Australians about Indigenous Australia, cultural identity and the Stolen Generations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to also pay tribute to the important work Uncle Archie did in the drug and alcohol space. Uncle Archie's own personal recovery from alcoholism was his story, and he shared that story. It was a symbol of the pain and the disconnect from culture that he felt acutely. On becoming the patron of the Western Regional Alcohol &amp; Drug Centre, Uncle Archie reflected, and he said these words:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Recovering from alcoholism is part of my story. It's so important for people with alcohol and drug problems to have a service like WRAD that they can access for health. Rehab, as well as music, saved my life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaking about the foundation, Uncle Archie also said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Foundation is a way for me to give back and pass on what's been given to me from people I've met on my journey who have pointed me in a different direction to a better way of life and understanding, to freedom. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I hope to be a signpost for others, to walk alongside and empower them to tell their story through the arts to point them in a deadly direction; in particular young people within the youth justice system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Together we'll fly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Uncle Archie was a once-in-a-lifetime person whose legacy touched so many. We remember and recognise his contribution not just in regard to music but also across First Nations communities across Australia. His contribution is in important community conversations, and it wasn't just his music, his song and his poetry; it was merely just his presence that people felt. Rest in power, Uncle.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="299352" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STEWART</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:36</span>):  It is with deep sadness that I rise to speak on the passing of Uncle Archie. Our nation suffered a profound loss with the passing of Gunditjmara and Bundjalung senior elder Uncle Archie Roach. I had the privilege of speaking with his family over the weekend to offer heartfelt condolences from my mob to his, and in doing that I got to hear how much they loved and adored him. I want to thank his family for generously sharing such an incredible human with the world and offer, again, my sincerest condolences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very fortunate to witness one of his last performances earlier this year at the Treaty Day Out in Shepparton. As soon as he was on stage for his set, the entire crowd moved towards the stage so they wouldn't miss a moment of his words—a beautiful thing to bear witness to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Uncle Archie was a truth-teller, activist and healer. He had a uniquely articulate way of being able to tell the difficult truths of our nation in a way that people could really hear, feel and understand. His music has been described as being built on pain but driven by hope—how very true. Uncle Archie's pain was born of being a Stolen Generations survivor. He gave voice to so many survivors with his music. It's heartbreaking to know that he was stolen so young that he has no memory of his mother and he never got to see her again before she passed. My heart smiles when I think of him being reunited and singing again with his great love, Aunty Ruby Hunter, and my heart sings to know that he will finally be reunited with his father and have unlimited moments to embrace his mother in the Dreaming.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many people who aspire to contribute to our society in a way that leaves it in a better place than when they got here, but very few really achieve this. Our country is a much better place thanks to his wisdom and music. Our country is a much better place thanks to Uncle Archie. 'Thank you' seems so inadequate in comparison to what you gave all of us, but I've been told that you didn't like a fuss being made over you; you were happy with just a cuppa and a Monte Carlo biscuit. So I'll say thanks by having a cuppa and a bickie for you today, Uncle. May your legacy live on forever. Rest in power, Uncle Archie Roach.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="BFQ" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BARBARA POCOCK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:38</span>):  I note this is not my first speech. I rise today to join with so many other Australians to reflect on and honour the extraordinary legacy of Archie Roach and to add my condolences to Archie 's loved ones. I was so sad to hear of Archie's passing last week. He was a proud senior elder, a remarkable singer-songwriter and storyteller, and a loving partner, father and foster father.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For me and my family and community, Archie's music was a gift. It provided the soundtrack to our lives, from the first album, <span style="font-style:italic;">Charcoal </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Lane</span>, to his most recent album, <span style="font-style:italic;">Dancing </span><span style="font-style:italic;">with </span><span style="font-style:italic;">My Spirit</span>, and every album and song in between. But Archie's music was much more than a soundtrack; it's a truth-telling, and it was a cultural gift of music which cut through to tell us the truth in a way that sometimes books and academic reading and history don't.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Seeing Uncle Archie and Aunty Ruby perform together is a powerful memory. It changed me. There are many ways to learn the truth. Art and music are so important to this, and Uncle Archie's gifts were rich and deep. He was a truth teller. His music and stories brought people across Australia to understand First Nations history and culture, including the ongoing and devastating impacts of colonisation. Through his songs, Archie provided a voice to First Nations people across the country. Of course, his song 'Took the Children Away' taught us all so much and will always be with me as a heart-wrenching recollection of his deep personal experience and the history of our long stolen generations and, as my colleagues Lydia and Dorinda have talked about and as others have said, such an important memory and truth telling for our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Archie was an inspiration to so many Australians. In an interview with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> in 2019 Archie said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">You can reach the darkest point in our life and come back, and come back good.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This quote reflects his storytelling, which came from a place of deep colonial trauma and its legacy but often had a message of peace and healing. Archie will be remembered by Australians for his courage, for his clarity, for his artistry in telling his own story and for being a voice to the experiences of First Nations people across our country—indeed, all Australians—a teacher, an artist and, as Dorinda said, a healer. Rest in peace and in power, Archie. My condolences to your family: thank you for lending him to all of us for all those years.</span>

                  <a href="245759" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister for Emergency Management</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:41</span>):  I also rise to pay tribute to the memory and the life of Uncle Archie Roach. I give my sincere condolences to his family and thank them for giving us permission to use his name so we may preserve and continue his legacy. Unlike some of the other speakers on this motion, I did not have the privilege of knowing Uncle Archie personally, but I saw him and his late wife, Ruby Hunter, perform on many occasions: at the Woodford Folk Festival, at the Blues Festival, at countless pubs and other festivals and, for the final time, probably about12 or 18 months ago, at the Home of the Arts facility on the Gold Coast. I was just talking with Senator McAllister, and we think one of the first times each of us saw Archie perform was at the Woodford Folk Festival, many years ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every one of those performances that I had the privilege of seeing was memorable—obviously for the music, obviously for the soul and obviously for the stories but also for the wry humour Uncle Archie often contributed between songs. That last time, when my family and I saw him perform at the Gold Coast, was a very memorable occasion. Any of you who've had the opportunity to go to the Home of the Arts will know there's an outdoor amphitheatre, and on a beautiful night—I think it was spring, although I can't exactly remember the time of year—it was a beautiful setting to be outdoors listening to Archie play some of those songs that we all knew so well, with my whole family in attendance. That particular event was one of the first times a major venue at the Gold Coast had put on a show that featured 100 per cent First Nations performers. Archie was the headline act, as he very much deserved, but some other emerging First Nations artists and some stars in their own right, like Jessica Mauboy, also performed. I really enjoyed the night, as did my wife, but, most importantly, so did our kids.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Uncle Archie's songs have touched the hearts and souls of audiences around the world. A Gunditjmara and Bundjalung man whose voice and message has resonated across nations and generations, his beautiful voice and storytelling articulated the injustices inflicted on Australia's First Nations peoples but also the hope for a better future for those peoples—something I know all of us want to see and want to contribute to. As a member of the stolen generation, Uncle Archie knew of these injustices all too well. As other speakers have noted, later in life he wrote the song we all know so well, 'Took the Children Away'. Of course, it's wrong to focus only one song of Uncle Archie's, because there were so many great songs, but probably that is the one he became best known for in the wider community. In that song, he wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Snatched from their mother's breast</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Said this is for the best—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">something that encapsulates the simply wrong attitude that carried the day around that policy in its days.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, reflecting on this song, probably more than any conversation in our own home or at school, it was this song that truly taught my own children the heartbreak and sorrow of the stolen generation and caused them to ask the question we should all ask ourselves: how on earth could this possibly have happened? I remember the conversations with my kids—particularly my daughter, the younger of our two children—about the song, what it was about, what had happened, and what we needed to do to repair the damage and repair the heartbreak that was caused to so many people as a result of that policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Archie Roach was placed in a children's home and a series of foster homes until he finally found a family he could call home. Uncle Archie was 14 years old when he received a letter about the death of his mother. Until that day, he didn't know he had a family or who they were. Shocked and angry, he ran away from home at 15, first to Sydney and then to the streets of Adelaide and Melbourne, always searching for his family and his identity—something that has happened to too many First Nations people in our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was while he was in Adelaide that he met his soulmate, the remarkable Ruby Hunter. I remember, in my 20s—and I'm sure you were there, Senator McAllister—seeing many concerts where the two of them performed. While each was an unbelievable performer in their own right, the two of them on the stage or on an album, contributing, complementing each other, and bringing different tones and different emotions, was one of the most amazing double acts Australian music has ever seen. It was such a privilege to ever get to see the two of them perform together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Uncle Archie was a pioneer of First Nations music. He was the voice of a generation. He was a singer, a poet and a truth-teller. His music embodies respect for all and demonstrated an artful commitment to truth-telling well before that approach was accepted by mainstream Australia. Fortunately, his legacy will live on in his music and in the footsteps he left on our country and on our hearts. Rest easy in the Dreaming, united with your Ruby again. Vale, Uncle Archie Roach.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HENDERSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:47</span>):  I join with my fellow senators in honouring the life of Archie Roach AM. In doing so, I acknowledge that his family has given all of us permission to say his name and to celebrate his life. I want to acknowledge the other, very fine contributions in the chamber today, including from Indigenous senators, and I particularly want to acknowledge the very deep friendship that Archie Roach and Senator Dodson shared.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also speaking as the shadow minister representing the shadow minister for the arts in this place, and few Indigenous Australians have made a greater contribution to Australian music than Archie Roach. In the words of his great friend, the late English actor Pete Postlethwaite:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Archie, a "stolen child" himself, is one of the finest artists of his generation, and a guiding light for the indigenous struggle for recognition and reconciliation. He's been called the Aboriginal William Blake … His music sticks in the soul. It gets deep inside you. These songs are a reaffirmation of identity, country, beliefs and spirit, and as Archie himself says, "they're about how no one listened to our recommendations on stolen kids or people dying in jails. And so it continues ... but we are still watching and constantly taking note."</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Archie Roach's music sticks, and will continue to stick, in the soul of Australians. It was his music which helped him to survive the trauma of being forcibly removed from his family at the age of two. Through music he was able to forgive and heal. He said, 'I believe in redemption and I believe in forgiveness, both important aspects of love, because I've … experienced both.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Archie Roach was a wonderful musician, a wonderful artist and an incredible storyteller. He was also a very significant mentor, including to others who had suffered from the impacts of alcohol. He died far too young, at only 66 years of age, but his music will live on in the hearts and souls of all Australians. I offer my heartfelt condolences to all of Archie's colleagues and friends and, of course, to his entire family, especially Amos and Eban, Archie's sons; and Kriss, Arthur and Terrence, Archie's foster children. May he rest in peace.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="155410" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:50</span>):  I rise to add my voice to these condolences for the loss of Uncle Archie, Gunditjmara, Djab Wurrung, Keerray Woorroong and Bundjalung man. I want to give my thanks, Uncle Archie, for your life, your inspiration, your work for First Nations justice, your work as a storyteller and a truth-teller, and your work sharing those stories and those truths with all of Australia. So many of us were touched by those stories and those truths. I want to send my condolences to Uncle Archie's family, to his friends and to everybody who has been touched by his life and his work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">His stories and his truths resonated with so many of us. For me as a Melbourne person, from Archie Roach's debut album, <span style="font-style:italic;">Charcoal Lane</span>, in 1990 his music was sort of a backdrop to our lives. It was part of the soundtrack of people and communities working for First Nations justice. I was actually quite a latecomer in listening to and knowing his music and getting to know what he was sharing with us, but the moment I will never forget was at Federation Square on 13 February 2008, when the apology for the stolen generations occurred here in Canberra. I was in Federation Square and I remember it being a hot afternoon. I remember listening to Uncle Archie singing 'Took the Children Away'. It was just so moving, and a huge crowd of people in Federation Square were just touched to the heart about the truths that he was singing about. He dedicated his performance at Federation Square to the mother he was separated from and to his own children. He said, 'This brings a new start in life for us, the way it should have been'—this apology to the stolen generations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I followed his career and his music more closely from then on. It was actually a distant friend, however, who gave me a copy of his autobiography; I think it was soon after it was published in 2019; it was probably early to mid-2020. She sent it to me and said, 'I just think you'd enjoy this.' This was soon after the loss of my wife, Penny, and I did. It just moved me so much to read his stories of resilience—everything he had been through and yet the hope and the goodness that he was bringing to the world. The quote that Senator Pocock just shared with us was, 'You can reach the darkest point in your life and come back, and come good.' That is what I think so many people got from his music and from his autobiography. Certainly for me it was a sense that you can get through these darkest times and continue on and be able to continue to work with honesty, to share that resilience and to work for justice together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was soon after getting a copy of that—I think it was in April last year—that, for the last time, I heard Uncle Archie perform, at the Werribee cultural centre. He was sharing his music with us, and what really came home to me then was just how his work brought people together. In fact, there's a microcosm. My whole family was there. Everybody had wanted to join together and go to this performance in Werribee, so my then 89-year-old mother and, I think, all of my siblings came together at that concert. Again, everybody was just so moved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously. the legacy of Archie Roach's life is for us to continue doing the work that he was doing: to continue sharing those stories, to continue sharing those truths and to continue working for justice; to acknowledge the pain, the hurt, the suffering, the genocide that has been going on for our First Nations peoples for over 200 years; and to commit ourselves to ending those awful practices, to stop taking the children away and to be working until our First Nations peoples have all of the rights, there is justice and we have treaties with our First Nations peoples—to continue that work that his songs and his life were such a powerful part of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you, Uncle Archie, may you rest in peace and in power.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="I0T" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:55</span>):  My family cried the day Archie Roach died, despite the fact that, unlike others here, we had never met him. But we cried because he meant so much to us as individuals and he helped us as a family know ourselves better as Australians—to know ourselves better in a way that was profoundly meaningful to us as a family and, I really believe, also to us as a nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our country is built on stories and from stories—stories that help us know who we are as a nation and as a people. I guess the story of the stolen generation, for an Australian like me, was not a story I knew or understood in the same way that my colleagues here as First Nations Australians know from their own lives and the lives of their kin and families. But, for me, Archie Roach opened up the visibility of First Nations stories about mission life, about racism, about dislocation and institutionalised racism. We saw that visibility and capacity to talk as an Australian people—and, in my case, as a family—about the experiences of First Nations people within our country but also with our friends and family, when we'd been unable to easily open up a way of talking about these issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Archie Roach's story <span style="font-style:italic;">Took the Children Away</span> is, of course, a children's storybook, and I've been able to teach my son in a way that he understands—in a way that I was deprived of as a child in knowing our nation's history—about the truth of stolen generations. His music showed us immense suffering over our 200 years of colonial history and a very personal journey of suffering and resilience through this. He did this in a way that has brought us all closer together as a nation. It's not a black armband version of history at all. These are stories of resilience that are a source of great pride for our nation—stories of resilience, delight and joy in lifting the visibility of First Nations people's lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Archie Roach sang of boxing, country and land, homelessness, intergenerations, family, racism, colonial dispossession, removal from country, but most of all, he also spoke of love. They're First Nations stories that resonated with us all as a nation and speak to who we are. So, as we move towards, I hope, voice, treaty and truth, I reflect on Archie Roach's words when he speaks of dark times and how you can come back good. That is something I reflect on. For us as a nation, it doesn't make up for the wrongs of our nation's colonial past, but it speaks to us and who we are as a nation in coming together to recognise this history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, as we remember today this immense Titan of Australian cultural history, I reflect on one of his songs, 'The Jetty Song':</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:02</span>):  I rise to speak in support of the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Self-Employment Programs and Other Measures) Bill 2022. The new employment services model Workforce Australia was developed by the previous coalition government over a number of years and commenced on 4 July 2022. The new model seeks to build on the success of jobactive and give jobseekers the best opportunity to find employment through a tailor-made approach. The former coalition government spent a number of years working with jobseekers, providers, peak bodies and employers on developing a model that works for all and supports a pathway for Australians off welfare and into work. It will eventually become a one-stop shop for Australians and Australian businesses to find work, retrain and get access to other government initiatives in employment and skills. This bill will continue to realise the model and will ensure the good intentions continue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The main amendments in this bill, in schedule 1, will make it clear that the family, social security and veterans entitlements laws operate in the same way in relation to self-employment assistance payments as for other niche payments, because of the name change. The New Enterprise Incentive Scheme, known as NEIS, has helped almost 200,000 people start their own businesses since it commenced, many of whom might otherwise have continued to rely on social security payments or veterans entitlements payments. The program helps people move off income support by creating their own job. In turn, many of these businesses have created work for additional people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Self-Employment Assistance program commenced on 1 July 2022 to replace NEIS assistance throughout Australia, other than on Norfolk Island, where NEIS will continue because we have an existing deed that does not expire until 2023. It is important that we continue this work, and the bill does this. These changes are primarily in sections relating to the treatment of entitlements, and they clarify in legislation that the self-employment assistance payments are to be treated in the same way as NEIS payments. For example, the Family Law Act 1975 defines 'income tested pension, allowance or benefit' as a pension, allowance or benefit prescribed by the Family Law Regulations. For that purpose, those regulations refer to payments made under NEIS so that such payments are included within the definition. This must be changed to reflect the Self-Employment Assistance program. That is appropriate, as self-employment assistance is similar to other NEIS assistance, the difference being that self-employment assistance participants will have much more flexibility in choosing and accessing support that best suits their circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 also means that, if self-employment assistance is given a different name, the family, social security and veterans entitlements laws will continue to operate in the same way—provided that the employment secretary makes a notifiable instrument giving notice of the change—without the need for a future bill. This is worthwhile because it means that we can spend less of the chamber's time on bills like this and focus on other measures to support employment in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The former coalition government's investment in Australia's workforce has worked to move people from unemployment and into jobs. Prior to the pandemic hitting, it had reduced Australia's level of welfare dependency to the lowest level in 30 years. The former coalition government successfully brought Australians through the pandemic, bringing Australia's historically low unemployment rates with it. The unemployment rate of 3½ per cent is a testament to that. From when we were elected to government in 2013, we were determined to put in place the strong economic policies and labour market programs that would allow the economy to recover and support Australians into work. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the coalition's strong economic management had supported the creation of over 1.5 million jobs. The economy was growing, Australia had record labour force participation, the unemployment rate was 5.2 per cent in March 2020 and, for the first time in 11 years, the budget was in balance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our former employment services programs have played an essential role in supporting economic recovery by increasing labour force participation and helping workers transition to new jobs. These programs, including jobactive, Youth Jobs PaTH, Transition to Work and ParentsNext, are working and have ensured that we've bounced back from COVID-19 and continue on the pathway of getting more Australians into work. These programs have assisted hundreds of thousands of Australians to improve their employability and gain employment, with jobactive having supported over two million job placements since its introduction in 2015. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To assist Australians back into work after a once-in-a-century pandemic, we built on this record and improved services for our most affected regions and our most disadvantaged jobseekers. We put boots on the ground across 25 regions to support employment through our Local Jobs Program. Employment facilitators developed local jobs plans in 25 regions, in collaboration with local stakeholders, employers and training organisations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new employment services model, known as Workforce Australia, is now in place and is providing more personalised services to better target jobseeker needs, investing in those jobseekers who need it and making greater use of digital technology. Workforce Australia was the biggest reform to employment services since the Howard government's reforms in the 1990s, showing our commitment to helping Australians into work and modernising one of the biggest expenditure areas of government. The coalition are proud of this record and continue to work where we can on improving employment opportunities, even if that means now from opposition. We commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:08</span>):  I rise to speak to the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Self-Employment Programs and Other Measures) Bill 2022. The Australian Greens believe that all people have the right to a livelihood; to pursue their preferred work; and to have freedom, dignity, economic security and equal opportunity in that work. Therefore, we support the objectives of the Self-Employment Assistance program, which is what's being addressed in this bill, and those of its predecessor, the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme, to help people find meaningful employment by creating their own jobs. It's a good thing. But we believe that the government has a responsibility to ensure that everyone can exercise their right to meaningful work, and what's being done in this bill is only a small part of what needs to occur. Successive governments have failed to ensure that everybody can exercise their right to meaningful work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Particularly for people who aren't currently working, there is so much more that we need to be doing. We have people on income support living in poverty, which is the last place you need to be to get the support that you need to access work. There's no point setting up schemes, fiddling at the edges and encouraging people to start their own small business if those people are languishing in poverty and can't afford to have a roof over their heads or put food on the table. These are not the conditions that enable people to find work. We need to completely overhaul the systems in place that are in many cases barriers to people finding work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to spend some time talking about those new systems in Workforce Australia. The experience of the introduction of Workforce Australia is that it is not doing anything to help many people find work. These are people who want to be able to find work but find themselves battling a government bureaucracy and a system that is not supporting them to find work. We are very disappointed that, earlier this year, the new Labor government began rolling out the previous government's broken and punitive employment system, Workforce Australia. I note that today we got notice in the House that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Tony Burke, is proposing that there needs to be an inquiry into Workforce Australia. I think there needs to be more than an inquiry. Certainly, when the terms of reference are that this inquiry proposed today wouldn't have a reporting date until September next year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the problems that exist with Workforce Australia at the moment, and they need to be fixed. Under this new system, people on income support have to complete enough activities to accrue 100 points a month or else have their payments cut off. Despite this being a major overhaul of the mutual obligations system, the Labor government provided little or no communication on the transition. According to a survey on the transition conducted by the Australian Unemployed Workers Union, 43 per cent of their members received no information from the government about these changes. Community members have expressed to me their confusion and distress as a result of this poor communication.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this isn't the end of the issues and the pain that Workforce Australia has caused and is causing. Despite Minister Burke's promise that this new system would be a clean slate, we have seen demerit points carried over from the jobactive system, which is in complete contradiction to the promise made by the minister. We have seen the deadnaming of trans people in communications with them. We have seen inaccessible communications to culturally and linguistically diverse communities and people with disabilities. There have been privacy issues and technical difficulty after technical difficulty. If we're serious about getting people work, and if we're going to try to get systems set up, we've got to do better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The<span style="font-style:italic;"> Guardian</span> recently reported that a 63-year-old woman from regional South Australia had to make a 250-kilometre round trip to meet her mutual obligations and keep her benefits under Workforce Australia. Despite living to Yorketown, she was referred to a job agent in Kadina, which was a 1½-hour drive—or 125 kilometres—from her home. Shockingly, these appointments and the long, tiresome journey that comes with them don't count towards the new points based system. Workforce Australia is causing people harm and stress. The system is already failing and yet it is jobseekers who are being held over a barrel and threatened with payment suspensions. People are terrified and confused. One user of the platform said, 'I am panicked, frustrated and have no idea what's going on.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Workforce Australia has failed people from day one. Unemployment advocates, people on income support and the Greens have been calling for a minimum three-month pause to payment cut-offs while people attempt to navigate this new, confusing system. We initially had a one-month pause because there was a recognition from the government that maybe the communication and the system weren't set up for the transition. Last week, Minister Burke announced that, in terms of accruing points, there would be an extra 30-day pause, acknowledging the problems with the system. Today we have a proposal for a House inquiry into Workforce Australia. I urge the government to listen to the unemployed advocates and people in income support, and take immediate action to ensure that no-one loses their income support payments. Without those payments, if you've got people being cut off and living in fear of being cut off you are not going to have a situation where people are capable and able to be their best and to get work, whether it's through applying for jobs or, like in the bill we're discussing today, assistance to start up their own small businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second area I want to talk about in particular is the absolute inadequacy of income support under our JobSeeker payments. We are in a cost-of-living crisis, and poor and working-class people all over the country are feeling desperate. Again, if you've got people living in poverty that can't afford to put food on the table they are in no position whatsoever to take up initiatives to help them find work by setting up their small business. According to an ACOSS survey more than half the people currently on income support are skipping meals, and the demand on food charities has seen a 50 per cent increase since the start of the pandemic. We have millions of people in this country who are living in poverty. We have got to address that as a core issue if we are serious about getting people into work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens think we need to abolish mutual obligations. They are not helping. In fact we had a real-life example of that during the COVID pandemic when mutual obligations were suspended and people's income support was doubled to account for people's lack of ability to find work. And what happened? The evidence is in: we actually had more people able to find themselves work during that period than in previous periods. The evidence is there: if you give people enough to live on and you don't make them jump through ridiculous hoops of mutual obligations, people want to get work. You then have people in a situation where they are able to pick up on the incentives provided in the Self-Employment Assistance program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyone who has ever struggled to put food on the table or had to make a choice between paying the rent on time on one hand and paying for their medication on the other knows the constant and crushing stress of living in poverty. In this wealthy country something is deeply broken when around 20 per cent of our population are receiving payments that aren't enough to survive on and you've got one in six children living in poverty. Think about what that means for those people's lives—the trajectory of their life ahead of them. If you start off life living in poverty, if you start off absolutely having to scramble, not having the opportunities that other people get, it sets you so far behind in terms of being able to realise your full potential. No parent should have to wonder how they are going to feed their kids this week or buy them new school uniforms next term.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need a plan to end poverty. They're the sorts of initiatives that are really important, that are going to do something about getting people into work. If we actually had a plan to end poverty—we know huge swathes of people are struggling every day to take care of their families and to get their most basic needs met. Governments are meant to serve people. Millions of Australians are hurting, and this parliament just can't ignore them. People want to be able to live their lives with dignity, without the constant fear of how they're going to keep their heads above water. It's not too much to ask.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens believe that a fair, socially just, democratic and sustainable society rests on the provision of an unconditional liveable income, complemented by the provision of universal social services. If everybody had a guaranteed liveable income, everybody would be in a position to realise their potential, to have the capacity to seek work, to undertake training programs, to know they're not going to have to work out how they manage to survive and scramble from one day to the next.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're supporting this bill today, but it is a tiny piece on the edge rather than tackling the fundamental problems we are currently facing that need absolutely serious overhaul. We need to reform the social security system to introduce a liveable income guarantee. By doing so, and by abolishing the broken and punitive mutual obligation requirements, the Greens plan actually would give every Australian a fair go and stimulate the economy. We know that the No. 1 thing that this parliament can do to address the cost-of-living crisis and help get people into work is to lift income support, as well as providing access to affordable housing and essential services, so that people aren't living in poverty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, we'll support this bill today, but we are calling on this government to do more: to abolish the mutual obligations, to lift income support to above the poverty line and to raise all payments to at least $88 per day, which is what is needed to keep your head above water. By doing so we would be giving every Australian the opportunity to get into employment and live a full and flourishing life. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:20</span>):  The bill before us today, the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Self-Employment Programs and Other Measures) Bill 2022, makes some technical changes regarding employment programs, which I will deal with later in my speech. But first, I would like to state how annoyed I get during debates in this chamber when senators on the other side make accusations that Labor members and senators do not understand what it's like to run a business. They obviously say this in an effort to reinforce the misguided, and patently false, notion that the coalition are the friends of small business and Labor are not. This is clearly wrong, and I will challenge that notion later in my contribution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I do, let me tell you what I find particularly infuriating about that claim. It's actually based on complete ignorance of the backgrounds of senators on this side of the chamber, including me. When we have debates about early childhood education and care, I often mention my more than a decade as an educator. I was a family day care educator, and, like many family day care educators, I was in charge of my own business. Also, I come from a family where my mother owned her own small businesses for 40 years. I know there are others on this side who have had similar types of engagement with small business.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I grew up in small business. I know small business. So I really would like those on the other side to please stop telling us we don't understand it. I understand the challenges and I understand the benefits. In the early childhood education sector you have all the usual challenges—collecting fees from customers, paying the bills and promoting your business—but on top of that you've got a whole set of regulations, from three levels of government, that you've got to comply with to ensure you're delivering safe and high-quality education and care. You have to deal with all this administrative work on top of your core business as an educator.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't have any quibbles about the regulations. It's an industry that deals with children who are vulnerable and at a crucial stage in their development. But it was tough. Through the industry I got to know many other educators, all of whom were running their own family day care businesses and facing similar challenges. So it really does get on my nerves, I have to say, when I am told that only the coalition cares about small businesses or Labor doesn't understand the challenges of running a small business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm happy to help anyone who comes to my office seeking to take on the challenge of running a small business. My staff and I are often encouraging constituents to call or visit their local business enterprise centres and avail themselves of the free advice and assistance on offer there. At this point, I'd really like to give a great shout-out to my local enterprise centre, the Kingborough and Huon Business Enterprise Centre, of which I've heard excellent reports from the constituents I've referred there. Their previous manager, Scott Dufty, who has served for a number of years, has recently retired, so I wish him well on his future endeavours. I also congratulate Kerry Muller on his promotion to manager. I was really pleased to catch up with both Scott and Kerry at an event recently where the centre was celebrating the renewal of their government contract to deliver enterprise centre services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My office has also helped small-business people to access business grants or other forms of financial assistance. I've established my office as a delivery partner in the No Interest Loan Scheme, NILS. NILS is commonly thought of as a program that low-income earners access so they can buy large household items, like a car, TV or fridge, but one of the services NILS also offers is no-interest loans to start a new microbusiness, and we have helped a few NILS clients with business ideas to lodge their applications. Those are just a few of the practical ways that I help people to establish small businesses or to thrive in their existing businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, when it comes to the bigger picture of what small business needs to succeed, Labor in government have a proud record of supporting small business. We recognise how vital small business is for the Australian economy, with 2.4 million small businesses throughout Australia employing 4.7 million people. It was the Rudd-Gillard Labor government that introduced the loss carry-back initiative, which allows small businesses to invest in their operations and then carry back their losses to earlier years, getting a refund for tax paid on previous profits. The Rudd-Gillard government also increased the instant asset write-off from $1,000 to $6,500. That meant a small business could invest in an asset, like a coffee machine or a bench tool, and instantly deduct it. We also introduced a measure that allowed businesses to instantly write off the first $5,000 of a motor vehicle purchase. We introduced these measures understanding the importance of cash flow to small businesses, allowing them the opportunity to access the tax deductions from capital purchases more quickly. Two of my brothers—well, they've both just recently retired—ran their own businesses for 30 or 40 years and, I've got to say, they found all of these things very advantageous to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Shamefully, the coalition, under the leadership of Tony Abbott, stripped away this valuable assistance, returning to the original threshold of a thousand dollars and subjecting small businesses to an effective $5 billion tax increase. But they must have seen the value in the measure, because they increased it again in 2015, at the same time trumpeting what a great help it would be for small business. So we introduced it, they cut it, and then they reintroduced it to say what heroes they were—what a backflip! Maybe they just couldn't cope with Labor getting the credit for doing something to help small business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous Labor government also established the Fresh Ideas for Work and Family program, a $12 million grants program to help small businesses meet the set-up costs of family-friendly working arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the current parliament, it's exciting to see that a Tasmanian colleague of mine—Julie Collins, the member for Franklin—has been appointed Minister for Small Business. My electorate office is in Ms Collins's electorate and I work very closely with her, and I'm sure any small business owners who know her as well as I do will be reassured that the portfolio is in good hands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's commitments to small business in government are outlined in our Better Deal for Small Business, which we took to the last election. This plan includes guaranteeing that the government considers the specific needs of small business during times of crisis; creating a mechanism to ensure that small businesses are paid within 30 days; making unfair contract terms illegal so that small businesses can negotiate fairer agreements with large partners; driving a genuine collaboration with small businesses and government to cut paperwork, target support and reduce the time that small businesses spend doing taxes; delivering simpler, more accessible and fairer outcomes in workplace relations by drawing on Labor's history of working with unions, workers and industry; and reducing small business transaction costs at the point of sale.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I can add to that list, although it relates to business in general, is Labor's commitment to establishing Jobs and Skills Australia and tackling the skills crisis by investing in university places and free TAFE. The COVID pandemic has laid bare the depth of the skills crisis across this country. Labor in government had a proud record of not only investing in skills but also having the mechanisms to work with employers, employees and unions to identify the skills gaps. I know about the great work of industry skills councils through my work as a union representative on two industry skills councils. Shamefully, these bodies were scrapped by the Abbott government, but I'm excited to see that this capability will be returning when we establish Jobs and Skills Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;">
                    </span>Another great Labor initiative for small business was the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme, or NEIS, introduced in 1985 by the Hawke government. This initiative is particularly important to mention because it relates directly to the bill we're debating now. Through NEIS, individuals can receive a package of services that help them to establish a new business. More recently it also helped existing business owners impacted by COVID-19 to continue running their business or refocus their operations to meet new areas of demand. Since NEIS was introduced it has helped over 198,000 people—198,000 people! There are a number of supports available through NEIS, including accredited small business training, help to develop a business plan, personalised mentoring from a NEIS provider—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  I want to talk a little bit about the ABC appointing an ombudsman, which is something that has been historically resisted. I am of the view that the ABC generally does a good job. I do think it has, at times, strayed into partisanship, and it has, at times, had a problem of being able to manage internal bias. But, in the main, I would say the ABC does a good job and has served the nation very well. As someone that wants the ABC to succeed, I have been concerned for a long time that the ABC had not been able to properly address the complaints that had been made about some of its programs and that it was a bit like Dracula running the blood bank in that, effectively, the complaint would go to the department which had been responsible for the program in some form.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having followed through the process of having a review, which the ABC Board commissioned into complaints handling, the ABC has now decided that it will in fact appoint an ombudsman. I believe the ombudsman was appointed last night or this morning. The ombudsman's job is to ensure that the ABC's reputation is maintained and enhanced. For people who want the ABC to succeed, it's important that they do handle complaints fairly, properly and swiftly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all make mistakes, and it would be ridiculous to suggest that an organisation as big and as successful as the ABC wouldn't make the odd mistake, so I welcome the appointment of the ombudsman. I think it will help the ABC, and we will be able to probe the success, transparency and governance around the ombudsman over future Senate estimates rounds. I welcome this from the ABC's board. It's a very good decision. Thanks for the opportunity to speak here today.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor looks forward to providing $2.8 million in funding for the project, as we believe it's important now—more than ever—to improve service delivery of respite care, and education for aged-care and disability workers. This funding will allow for training alongside respite services, with an additional 55 support workers completing their certificate II and III in aged care and disability care every year. Trainees will learn on the job and will be job-ready much quicker. The service is open 24/7 and will add to the capacity of care in the state in the form of 35,000 hours of day respite per year. It will also take pressure off Launceston General Hospital by freeing up more beds and ensuring Tasmanians can receive medical care when they need it most from well-trained carers and health professionals.</span>

This centre, along with our commitment to put a nurse on site 24/7 in all aged-care homes, as well as giving carers more time to care, backing a pay rise for aged-care workers, implementing new food standards and increasing transparency in the sector, will see a meaningful reform to this sector.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I'm great at budgeting but now budgeting means not buying the basics. It means rationing out food to last a fortnight. If I've budgeted well I can eat one meal a day. If another expense comes up I have to choose which days I need to skip food completely. I try to choose days I have no appointments so I can sleep through the hunger. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">In November last year I was diagnosed with scurvy and malnutrition. Let that sink in. A country as wealthy as Australia and I'm unable to eat enough good food to get the nutrients I need to live. This has a devastating effect on my health. How can I possibly get work-ready when I can't afford to live? Yet jobseekers are expected to be able to find employment under these conditions. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Prices are rising and Jobseeker isn't. I'm isolated from my community and have lost countless friends because I can't afford to grab a coffee with them. There's nothing to look forward to and I've become hopeless … It's day after day of being in survival mode. It's stressful and it's demeaning.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  On any given night in Australia, there are 116,000 people experiencing homelessness. According to the 2016 census, in my home state of South Australia there were more than 6,000 people experiencing homelessness every single day. Too many of those experiencing homelessness are young people and children. Homelessness is more than rough sleeping, and it's not always long term. But we know even short periods of homelessness can have long-term impacts on health, education and employment outcomes, and we also know that homelessness can happen to any of us. It can be unexpected—when a lease expires, when a relationship breaks down or when employment unexpectedly ends. And we also know the fastest-growing cohort of people experiencing homelessness is middle-aged women, who often have little to no economic safety net in terms of their superannuation and employment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week is National Homelessness Week, and the theme is 'To end homelessness we need a plan'—and a plan the Albanese government has. I am deeply proud to be a part of the government that will establish a national housing and homelessness plan and that will establish a national housing supply and affordability council to ensure that the Commonwealth plays a leadership role in increasing housing supply and improving housing affordability. We are building 4,000 new social housing properties, specifically allocated for women and children fleeing domestic and family violence, and we're investing $100 million in crisis and transitional housing options for women and children. We won't fix homelessness overnight, but the size of the task should never deter us from the urgency of action.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge all those organisations in my community that are working every day to support those experiencing homelessness, not just in Adelaide but in our rural and regional areas, where we know this issue is so significant too. Thank you for the work you do each and every day. </span>

We have the fabulous beach-to-beach riverside walk along the beautiful Edward River. We have state forests and we're on the edge of the Barmah-Millewa national park. And you can go and see the Barmah Choke, which talk about regularly when I have my water hat on. We have the Peppin Heritage Centre, which tells the story of the very famous, world-renowned Australian merino sheep. The bloodline was actually developed in and around Deniliquin. We have the Hay Plains and the majestic sunsets you can see. In summer we've got water skiing and river floats down the river. You don't need a boat. You just need a blow-up mattress, and you can thoroughly enjoy it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:40</span>):  The Albanese Labor government has introduced legislation to deliver 10 days paid family and domestic violence leave for all Australian workers. This landmark legislation started with strong union women standing up and speaking out in their workplaces for safety and security. Through their action and with the election of the Albanese Labor government, we will now see this entitlement extended to all Australian workers who need it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of these pioneering union women was Sharon, an Australian Services Union delegate from the Surf Coast shire in Victoria. Sharon was in an abusive relationship when her EBA negotiations started in 2010. She fought to include paid leave for workers going through similar situations. Standing together, these ASU members became the first in the country to have paid family and domestic violence leave. This win set off a national campaign which has run for over a decade, culminating in the legislation that we introduced.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last month I spoke with Kristy, an ASU member from the City of Greater Geelong Council. Through her ASU agreement she has access to domestic violence leave already. Kristy was able to use it when facing domestic violence at the hands of her ex-husband. Years later, Kristy is still going through the court system to keep herself and her children safe. She told me that this leave meant she had time to reorganise her life, to keep her job and her house and to keep her children safe and secure. Kristy told me: 'Now I want everyone to have access to it.' And because of the tireless campaigning of women like Sharon and Kristy in their unions across the country, they will.</span>

It has been nine years of imprisonment, brutality, deliberate cruelty and separation from families for thousands of people and nine years of murder, rape and child sex abuse in a system specifically designed to punish and harm innocent people. Right now there are over 200 people still in Papua New Guinea and Nauru still suffering and still in exile after nine long years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I met this morning with three people who suffered through so many years of detention, both offshore and onshore—three very brave people: Ismail, Betelhem, and my friend Thanush, who I first met on Manus Island in 2016 and who is with us in this chamber today. It's good to see you, my brother. Their message was simple. The people left behind in Papua New Guinea and Nauru need emergency evacuation here to Australia. They need medical support, they need freedom, they need community support and they need permanent resettlement in a safe place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Labor Party sent them to Manus Island and Nauru in the first place, and the Australian Labor Party can and must evacuate them now, immediately, and bring them to Australia. There is much, much more that we can do for these people, but immediate, urgent evacuation is the critical and urgent necessity. Bring them here and bring them here now. Nine years is far, far too long. Let's not make them wait for a single day more.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Terri</span><span class="HPS-Electorate">tory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:44</span>):  Recently, I had the pleasure of visiting the good people on Norfolk Island. It is a beautiful part of the world, some 2,000 kilometres out in the Pacific Ocean. There's an amazing, generous community spirit, with families who have been there since 1856. If something is broken, the community will come together to fix it—and there's not much on that island that can't be fixed with the community spirit and elbow grease of the locals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, one of the challenges that they desperately need the Commonwealth's support with is the cargo crisis unfolding on the island. The supermarket shelves are running bare. They're low on stock, and, being so reliant on tourism, tourist operators are struggling to have enough food to ensure that they can actually serve meals to their customers. It's a worrying set of conditions, given how reliant they are on tourism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst I commend the government for increasing the number of air freight trips, the community have told me that they are still struggling to get supplies. Major investments are needed to support a modern and safe shipping delivery system for the island, particularly as some products cannot travel via air freight, such as medical oxygen cylinders. Norfolk Islanders want to help, and I hope the government will reach out and consult with locals on how to overcome these challenges. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the Norfolk Islanders for their hospitality and generosity. I hope to return soon and explore more of your amazing island. I was lucky enough to get across to Phillip Island and see some of the amazing work that Parks Australia are doing over there.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  Last week, the Auditor-General released an audit report into the Building Better Regions Fund and tried to somehow allege that the government didn't act in the best interests of the taxpayers in spending that money. I should point out that $1.2 billion was spent over five years. Last night, I read that audit report. I went through it to look for what actually was spent and where it was spent wrongly, and I noticed that the Auditor-General didn't mention once where the money was actually not spent properly or wasn't in the best interests of the taxpayer. I've got a bit of history here with the Auditor-General. Last year he made the accusations—very unfair accusations—that the former coalition government had paid too much for the land at the Leppington Triangle. That was completely false.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my 25 years of financial accounting, I've never seen a worse audit report prepared. The Auditor-General failed to comply with AASB13, paragraphs 29 and 30, which say all land must be valued at best use regardless of zoning. The Auditor-General tried to claim that the land was agricultural land when it was actually in the airport zone. You don't buy land for an airport and then put cattle on it; you tend to build. So it has to be for best use.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He failed to consult with staff in the department. One of the staff in the department—who was completely innocent, mind you—had the Federal Police turn up on his doorstep, in front of his children, which was very intimidating to the staffer. These powers shouldn't be abused, and the Auditor-General should not be being political in what should be an impartial position.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look at the market value for five minutes—when I first heard about this, I hopped on realestate.com and looked up the suburb, and five acres was going for $6 million. So you could work out in a matter of minutes that what the coalition had paid was clearly the market value. I would suggest in future that much better quality assurance be applied to our auditing.</span>

Surely, if our bounty is not being shared fairly, we must correct that. Together we can defeat predatory billionaires who believe they should own everything and we should own nothing. Together we can change the lives of First Australians in remote communities who deal with conditions that, today, no human being should ever have to. We can and must start on that today.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  Disabled people deserve access to this parliament. Why is this concept one which every single Labor or Liberal government finds so confronting? This week my colleagues Senator David Pocock and Senator David Shoebridge requested an Auslan interpreter to join them in the Senate to interpret their first speeches. This request was denied. Their request was denied because your rules are based on an old, ableist way of doing things: the rules that say that this parliament must deny the request to avoid setting a precedent of a stranger on the floor. To me, yet again they have denied disabled people the opportunity for genuine inclusion in this place. The Procedures Committee are set to review these ableist rules, and it is about damn time they do so. If you think that captioning is good enough for deaf and other Auslan-using people to access parliamentary feeds, you are wrong; if you think that relegating an interpreter to another room to provide their service is good enough, you are wrong; and, if you think that what you've granted today, an on-screen interpreter, is good enough when an in-person interpreter was requested, you are wrong. Let me also add that, if you think this allowance is a one-off, you are wrong. Why should anyone who is travelling to the parliament be denied access in their own language? Auslan interpreting should be offered during every sitting, every speech, every time.</span>

Just when we elected the Labor government, guess what happened? They took the first opportunity to turn their back on Western Australia. Not only did Anthony Albanese, the Prime Minister, say he would govern for all of Australia; he undercooked Western Australia's representation in the federal cabinet, and now he wants to abolish this parliament's Joint Standing Committee on Northern Australia.</span>

He wants to silence the Kimberley region—towns like Derby, Broome, Kununurra and all of those many communities in between, including Indigenous communities. Northern Australia represents 53 per cent of this continental landmass and 1.3 million people. Two hundred thousand of them are Indigenous, and Anthony Albanese, supported by Western Australian Labor senators, wants to abolish this committee. This is outrageous.</span>

It was a testimony to the strong bipartisanship or tripartisanship of this parliament in responding to very important issues that were not just Western Australian issues and not just national issues but issues that the whole international community took notice of. And what does Anthony Albanese, the Prime Minister, want to do? Supported by Western Australian Labor senators, he wants to abolish the northern Australia committee.</span>

Not only will this project enable Carbon Revolution to produce an additional 75,000 carbon fibre wheels per annum at a 60 per cent lower cost, supporting state-of-the-art clean energy technology and 332 jobs; it will position Australia as a leader in the production and export of carbon fibre wheels.</span>

                  </a>  The impact from the former government's lack of energy policy is being felt across the economy by Australian families and businesses. Skyrocketing wholesale electricity prices are putting pressure on budgets. You promised a gas-led recovery and you had a gas crisis. Renewables, the cheapest form of energy, declined under you. The fact is: the lack of policy certainty, the lack of any policy framework, the chaos—do you know what it did? It stifled investment. It slowed the uptake of renewables. Instead of being well placed to deal with this challenge, Australians were left vulnerable by a government that had 22 energy policies.</span>

Minister, last week the Federal Court fined the CFMMEU and two officials in our state home of Queensland more than $150,000 for entry breaches, thuggish behaviour and disgusting, homophobic slurs on the $5.4 billion Queensland Cross River Rail project. Will the minister guarantee that, by abolishing the Australian Building and Construction Commission, this disgraceful and disgusting behaviour will not become even more prevalent on construction sites in Queensland and across this nation? </span>

But the comments made by judges in the particular case that Senator Scarr was referring to are not the only comments that we've heard made by the judiciary about the ABCC. To take one example, Justice North in the Federal Court blasted the ABCC for wasting time and taxpayers' money on prosecuting two CFMMEU officials for 'having a cup of tea with a mate'. Justice North criticised the ABCC, saying this is a 'minuscule, insignificant affair'. </span>

And thank you again for reminding us that Senator Cash has apparently been ruled out from asking any questions about the portfolio that she's the shadow minister in. It is interesting that we continue to see members of the opposition talk up the ABCC when its record was about prosecuting trivial matters, going after unions, going after workers, rather than actually doing anything to improve the lot of workers in the industry.</span>

And the reason we intend to abolish it is that it has been a gross waste of taxpayers' money, prosecuting minor issues involving workplaces, workers and unions, and it has done nothing whatsoever to deal with the labour productivity issues that exist in the industry. For all the opposition's talk about the ABCC, productivity has fallen on construction worksites. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Minister, in just a minute or two, the RBA will announce a further increase in interest rates. Last week, the Treasurer said that these interest rate increases will result in higher unemployment and further cuts to real wages. Workers, renters and recent homebuyers are being smashed to try and bring down inflation, which is being driven by supply shocks and corporate profiteering. Is the government seriously suggesting that there is no alternative? In 2022, is there really no better way for government bodies to respond to the current bout of inflation—a way that would cause less pain for Australians?</span>

The government supports the independence of the Reserve Bank and its responsibility around setting monetary policy.

While these interest rates are hard on households, when you've got inflation at the level we've got it you will see rising interest rates.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The independent Reserve Bank has made its decision today to increase interest rates by another 50 basis points, bringing the cash rate to 1.85 per cent. Australians knew that this was coming but it doesn't make it any easier to handle. The cycle of rate rises commenced before the election, in response to the inflationary pressures that emerged before the election. Average homeowners owing $330,000 will have to find about $90 a month more for repayments on top of the $220 extra in repayments since early May. For Australians with a typical $500,000 mortgage, it's an extra $140 a month in addition to the extra $335 they've had to find since early May. This won't come as a surprise to many but it will still be a shock to many households. Families will have to make more hard decisions about how to balance the household budget in the face of pressures like higher grocery prices and higher power prices, which the member for Hume kept hidden from them prior to the election.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a government, we are focusing on the economic plan we took to the election campaign. It makes sensible investments in child care, in skills and in digital services, using the National Reconstruction Fund, making child care cheaper and lowering the price of energy through the Powering Australia plan. These are the commitments that we made in the election; these are the commitments we will do. We will monitor all of these in the lead-up to the October budget and the decisions we take there, which will be primarily about fixing the waste and rorts of the previous government and implementing the election commitments that we made.</span>

Obviously, higher interest rates primarily affect mortgage holders, but there's an impact on savers as well. As the Treasurer pointed out earlier today, he's found it disappointing that higher interest rates weren't necessarily being passed on to savers and he will raise this directly with the banks, and I'm sure that those opposite would support that approach. The Treasurer has said that savers have been the principal victims of interest rates when they've been incredibly low and that they should be the beneficiaries of rising interest rates. He said they've been doing it tough for some time now and it's time they got a bit of relief, and the government certainly supports that approach.</span>

Australians know that problems like high and rising inflation have been made worse by a decade of wasted opportunities and the wrong priorities of those opposite. The Albanese government's economic plan is a direct response to the economic challenges that we face right now: responsible cost-of-living relief; cheaper child care; cheaper medicines; addressing the supply-side inflationary challenges and taking the speed limit off the economy by investing in skills and productivity; cleaner and cheaper energy—get that one, Senator Henderson; getting wages moving again; and beginning the very difficult work of budget repair so that the trillion dollars of Liberal debt doesn't grow bigger and bigger for generations to come.</span>

What the Labor Party has inherited after nine years of neglect on this subject matter is a very serious situation. The decision today by the Reserve Bank to increase interest rates certainly hasn't made that issue any easier to deal with.</span>

The point, I think, of the discussions that we've been having since the Prime Minister's address on Saturday is really about progressing constitutional recognition for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, which has been worked on for many, many years. </span>

                  </a>  President, with all due respect—yet again, the question was very, very clear. It was in relation to comments about ATSIC and why the Minister for Indigenous Australians is using ATSIC as the basis for the Labor Party model. I put it to you—and I may have to request that you have a look at your rulings—that the mere mention of a word in a question does not enable the minister to refer to that particular word as the answer.</span>

As the Prime Minister has said, there will be further consultation and deliberation with First Nations people, and with the community more broadly, as we work towards the referendum, but we've been talking about this for 15 years. We want the debate around it to be respectful, we want to bring people together on the journey and we want to get the outcome in the end. That is what Minister Burney and all of us are working towards.</span>

Earlier the same day, the Prime Minister outlined that the Australian parliament would decide what the voice will look like—after the referendum. On behalf of all Australians, can the minister please clarify who is correct: the Prime Minister or Minister Burney? </span>

And that is the work that needs to be done now. We won't play the game of dividing people on the basis of certain quotes that I haven't heard. This is a process where we would like to work together, to reach across the chamber, to hear different views, to have that fed back in—we understand there isn't unanimous agreement even in this parliament, let alone outside the parliament. So let's work together to deliver a magnificent outcome for this country.</span>

We would say that we need both: that we have constitutional recognition of the oldest continuous culture on the planet and, at the same time, that we implement and improve—through consulting, rather than imposing, and through bringing people together—the policies that are designed to support First Nations people. It's that we do both and that they're interlinked. That is the whole point; it's not one or the other. There is universal agreement that we need to see improvements for First Nations people, in a whole range of areas—health, education, jobs and economic security, housing, community safety and all of that—but that doesn't mean that we should walk away from this opportunity— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Minister, right now superannuation managers can only spend their members' money to support their members' financial wellbeing. I would have thought that's just basic common sense, but somehow Labor doesn't agree. Don't you care if directors spend Australians' retirement money on stuff they don't need? We know they'll go back to paying for flashy corporate retreats and news websites like they were doing before we changed the laws.</span>

At least they have to tell members who they're donating to and how much they're giving them. Why is Labor proposing to change that? Aren't you guys supposed to be about transparency? That's what you sold during your election. Or do you only care about transparency when you're trying to win elections?</span>

I know this is an issue you've worked on for many years, particularly in your committee roles. As every employer and worker in Australia knows, our country is facing a skills shortage crisis. This is the workplace legacy of a decade of training cuts and inaction from an incompetent coalition government, and projections are that nine out of every 10 new jobs over the next five years will need a post-school qualification, heightening the need for greater investment in our training system. The failure of the former government—which they're upset to be reminded of—to invest in skills is one of the key causes of our economy's capacity constraints and the higher inflation that has resulted. That's why the Albanese Labor government is taking action right now. The Jobs and Skills Summit in September is part of delivering on our election promise to bring people together—something the last government was incapable of doing—and find common ground on some of our tough economic challenges. Of course, as Senator Gallagher has pointed out, we have inherited a budget with a trillion dollars of debt, so the government will ensure that any measures taken will provide a good economic return.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians voted in May for a government that looks ahead and makes real plans for the future, so we can shape our future instead of just reacting to events and missing opportunities—something that we had to endure nearly 10 years of from those opposite. We know a lot of Australians are doing it tough, so a key focus of the summit will be how we can improve lives and livelihoods, raising incomes, creating good jobs and getting Australians the skills they need for the jobs of tomorrow. The summit will bring Australians together, including employers, unions, civil society and governments, to address our shared economic challenges. We need all sorts of skills in our country, whether they be traditional or new skills, and it's this government's actions, including the Jobs and Skills Summit, which will be good for jobs, good— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The Albanese government took office at a time of rising inflation and interest rates, falling real wages and a trillion dollars of debt which is now more expensive to service. It really does take some effort for a government to deliver, at the same time, falling wages and a skills shortage, because orthodox economic theory would suggest that, if you were to have a skills shortage, wages would go up, but, at a time of skills shortages in this country, the ex-government sent them down.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This situation was of course made worse by the previous government's decision to abandon migrant workers during pandemic lockdowns, heightening the skills shortages we saw across industries. It's also true the previous government failed to make an agreement with the state and territory governments on skills funding. Not one state or territory government signed up to the previous government's approach, whether they were Labor or coalition. So it's no surprise the previous government neglected TAFEs, the lifeblood of the vocational, educational and training system, and failed to do the work needed for our skills sector.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again, we've seen a severe lack of economic literacy from the Labor Party today. We've seen again, following the theme this week, that they have no idea how to tackle the cost-of-living crisis in this country. We have seen severe impacts on the price of groceries. Obviously, we've seen huge increases to the cost of fuel. We've seen massive increases to people's mortgage repayments. Labor is basically saying: 'Wait till the budget. Wait till October. We're not going to do anything about it till October. We're a fiscally responsible government, honestly, but we don't have anything to do now to help Australians. We're going to wait till October.' Quite rightly, I think, the Australian people would be watching closely. They'd be watching this government very closely, and they would be starting to worry that there actually is no plan: no plan to tackle the inflationary pressures in our economy and no plan to tackle the cost-of-living pressures faced by Australian families. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Particularly, in my constituency—I love to talk about everything outside the city—in regional areas, the cost of fuel alone is such a significant pressure. Families now have to make a decision as to whether to continue the Saturday morning football, because the cost of driving the car to practice and then to the game on the weekend is simply too much for the household budget. This is not necessarily something that will affect those in this place—it certainly won't affect the union officials who are advising this government—but it does affect families out there, whether they're in suburbia, outer metro Australia or regional Australia. These pressures are very real, and 6.1 per cent is the headline number, but everyone out there who does the weekly grocery shopping knows that the cost pressures, particularly on groceries, are seemingly much higher than that. You are seeing extraordinary pressure on household budgets in terms of balancing the books, making sure people can get through the week and making sure they can do those extra things that they want to for their kids. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We see again today that we have a government with no plan, no strategy, to help Australian families now. 'Wait till October,' is the answer. 'We're responsible.' Well, you will be responsible. You'll be responsible for an awful lot of economic pain unless you get these settings right. As the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Peter Dutton, said in the other place, the Australian economy needs a very finely balanced response. The government needs to provide a very finely balanced response. We have to protect Australian families from cost-of-living pressures and a wage price spiral. This government needs to be able to deal with both sides of the issue. It is a test of leadership for this Prime Minister, and instead we have Jim Chalmers talking about putting a union rep on the board of the RBA. How is that going to help?</span>

Well, Senator Brockman, you damn beauty! Thank you so much, dear Lord. I'm coming back! Do you want to talk about the increasing costs of living? Don't go! Come back, Senator Brockman. I've got respect for you. It's just that you do mix with some strange people. I'll give you two words: Josh Frydenberg. I'll give you another two: Scott Morrison. You want to talk about the cost of living. I'll tell you what happened. Let's cast our mind back to mid-May when those two geniuses of the Liberal Party thought it was a fantastic idea—anything it took to win a vote. They thought: 'How can we con people that they should vote for us again even though we've been absolutely incompetent and done five-eighths of nothing?'</span>

                  </a>  For you, Mr Deputy President, it would be my privilege. For my good friend Senator Fawcett—there's my second gift from heaven. Lord! This is getting better. I'm coming back! They thought that it was a great idea, in the dark of night, to slash the diesel fuel credits from the road transport industry and from the agriculture industry. Anyone with half a peanut in their head would understand where I'm going on this one. Our truckies and our agriculture industry—Senator Brockman, I wish you were still here—get 17.8c per litre to claim back every three months in their BAS. Guess what happened? There was not a 22 per cent reduction in diesel costs, because they stole the 17.8c diesel fuel credits from the road transport industry and the agriculture industry. I'll tell you what happened. All the truckies got was a 4c-a-litre reappraisal, or whatever the word is. I know about this because I sit at the bowser fuelling trucks in my spare time—it's a fun thing; the whole lot of you should try it—and, in the last 12 months, I watched diesel go from $1.50 to $2.40 a litre. Don't worry about the rip-off of the 17.8c. There's all that cost of diesel going too. What happens in the real world is that, when a lot of the big operators negotiate their contracts, they have what are called 'fuel levies'. I'm not going to insult your intelligence, senators, because you are the three smartest ones on that side. I'll give you that. You know exactly what I'm talking about. The majority of the transport industry—</span>

                  </a>  No, three. Let's leave it at three, Matt. You and I are mates. Let's keep it that way. About 70 per cent of the road transport industry is mum-and-dad businesses—small to medium-sized enterprises, so to speak—who have no ability to negotiate the fuel levy. Oh, gee whiz! I can't believe it. Can I ask for an extension of time, please, Mr Deputy President? I could go for an hour on this underwater with a gob full of marbles! Those mum-and-dad businesses do not have the ability to put that back onto their costs. Do you wonder why we're seeing $10 iceberg lettuces? It's because the cost of road transport and agriculture has gone through the roof.</span>

You knew it was just criminal to allow your previous Prime Minister and Treasurer to try and con the people of Australia, but the worst part is—it did me another favour; another present fell in my lap—that they absolutely disrespected the road transport industry. The only thing that saved them is the complete incompetence of the Australian Trucking Association, which I rightly call 'the Canberra branch of the National Party'. They don't represent the transport industry, and they weren't going to say anything to their Nat and Lib mates. I've got to tell you: thank goodness that everyone else raised their voices.</span>

But for the $13 extra that is saved on the Hyundai that got filled up once a week, put another nearly $30 in the cost of groceries at Woolworths, Coles and other stores—and you think that's good mathematics? And the good burghers of Australia woke up to you, because I couldn't wait to tell every single Australian who was listening what Josh Frydenberg and Scott Morrison pulled over their eyes, whilst, sadly, the rest of you just sat there like lemmings going over the edge of the cliff! Well, guess what? It's still a major problem. </span>

But I'll tell you what: how do some of you—not you three good ones over there; the rest of you on that side over there—or how do they look in the mirror at night and think that they've been great representatives of their communities!

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:15</span>):  I too rise to take note of answers by Senator Gallagher, supported by her ministerial counterpart, Senator Watt. With your Scottish surname, I'll start off with this. The concept of history being written is often attributed to Winston Churchill, but, in fact, it is traced back to 1746, to the Battle of Culloden, in Scotland, where one of the clan leaders lamented that he didn't know how many members of his clan died on the battlefield because it's the victor who writes the history and counts the dead. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we have seen a lot of that in this place. Almost every second sentence, in the answers that have been provided, is about what was inherited, or the former government, and talking about the need to re-create and reinvest in things that are claimed to have been a failure. The test that the Treasurer, who Senator Gallagher represents, held out for himself about the success of their government was: what happens to power prices, what happens with apprentices and manufacturing and what happens with wages? So there's been a lot of talk about training and manufacturing and skills in this question time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's really important to place on the record the fact that, last year, in the last full year of the coalition government, under Prime Minister Scott Morrison, there was a record $6.4 billion in skills and investment. We actually had the most apprentices, in training, since records began in 1963. Let me repeat that: the most apprentices, in training, since records began in 1963. Part of the reason for that is the strategic investments that the Morrison government made in areas of manufacturing. We had the Modern Manufacturing Initiative and fund, which sought to identify those areas that were critical to Australia's security and Australia's future. That went to important areas such as defence, space, medical goods, supply chain resilience, critical minerals—the things that the world has identified, particularly during the period of COVID, that are critical to a nation's security. We have seen not only the government funding that has gone into those programs but co-investment from industry, which has led to some of the great outcomes, in terms of the numbers of people in training, but has also led to things like the unemployment rate being down at 3.9 per cent and decreasing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To go to Senator Gallagher and her representing the Treasurer and the test that he has set, where he has said the test is what happens with manufacturing and apprentices: unlike the coalition—who worked with industry to invest in more productive capacity, which led them to invest, to employ people, to train people—around apprentices, we see a talkfest. The plan from the Labor government is a talkfest. That's what their plan is on skills. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to manufacturing, for those who read the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span>, on 24 July there was quite a substantive article expressing concerns that I have heard, on the ground, from people within this space and the defence sector, that the razor gang within the Albanese government, as they seek to find savings ahead of the budget, have put a pause on the modern manufacturing grants, which means that companies who have invested, who have employed, who have started to train people, are now expressing concern to me—and were expressing concern to the journalist who wrote the article—that these projects, which underpin Australia's sovereignty, our security and our supply chain resilience, are now in doubt. So manufacturing has actually been stalled by the Albanese government. So, as the Australian public consider these first couple of months of the government, they should compare the positive investment that led to new jobs, new innovation, and training for our children and future generations with a talkfest and a razor gang that has put all of those investments in doubt. I think the Australian public will in time realise that those people who have chosen to rewrite history have, in actual fact, no real plan to create a future.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'NEILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:20</span>):  I rise with pleasure to refute some of the nonsense that we have heard in the contributions from those who are speaking for the opposition today. They may rail at the answers that they're receiving, but the reality is they're on the end of a bit of truth-telling after nine years of the deception and thimble-and-pea tricks that have populated this government's action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian people know they're hurting. I talk to people in the retail sector very, very frequently. People are now finding it really hard, when they get to the check-out, to make ends meet. That is because, when we came into government, those opposite had left this country not only with a trillion dollars in debt but also in a state where we found we have rising inflation, rising interest rates, supply chain disruption—as Senator Gallagher indicated—no investment in skills and an energy market that is in crisis. That's the reality of what nine years of the former government delivered. And yet they come in here and act as if they gave Australians a great experience and they left us all fine. It's a joke.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's like when you've got kids and they're about seven or eight, and you say, 'Go in and tidy up your room,' and they just stuff everything under the doona cover, pull it over the top and pretend it's not there. That's the equivalent of the 23rd energy policy of the member for Hume. He had 22 goes at trying to deliver some policies—but no market certainty. No wonder smart people weren't putting their money behind this government, because they couldn't tell which way they were going to turn on any day. They had no solution, so he brought out the doona and pulled it over, four days before the election. They can't tell the truth. They throw the doona over it so the Australian people don't know there has been a 19 per cent increase in energy—they'll never figure it out! The contempt for the Australian people that is manifest in the questions that are being asked by the opposition and by their responses, which absolutely fail in a court that looks at fact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what Australian families are faced with: the fact that inflation delivered by the policies of the previous government is making it harder for them; the fact that they had to pay through the nose for training; the fact that the previous government didn't tell them the truth on so many occasions. So contemptuous of the Australian people were the former government that Minister Taylor thought it was okay to cover up a massive increase in the cost of energy that was going to flow through into the economies of this country's families. And that is why they lost the election—in the end, you can pull the doona over things for only so long before the adults have to come in. Maturity has to enter. Proper conversations have to be had.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This afternoon, those in the opposition have characterised the skills and training forum that's going to be held—a national forum to deal with the fact that we haven't got enough workers for our small businesses to operate effectively—as a talkfest. They don't know anything about talking. If they had talked properly to the Australian people, they would have come up with policies that hadn't landed us with the situation we find ourselves in, with rising inflation, a trillion dollars in debt and supply chain disruption. All of that is because of their failure to have authentic conversations—real conversations about what matters to this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So it's a bit rich when they come in here and start trying to run a line that there's no plan. There's plenty of plan. There was the plan that we took to the election. There's the plan that enlivened the vision of Australians of a better future for themselves and their children, for small businesses, for people who want to get training and for people who want to employ people who get training. We have a plan, and we've begun to implement it already with the legislation that's been brought into this place. Those opposite don't like it, and they are attempting in this first period of our being in this place to rewrite history—to absolve themselves of the sins of their failures in public policy. And nowhere are those failures more evident than in the hip-pocket pain of every business and every household that is suffering the consequences of years and years of neglect in dealing with the energy reality of Australia. Those opposite should not be attended to. They failed the nation, and they're on the correct side of the chamber.</span>

In relation to Senator Sterle's contribution, I'd like to make some preliminary comments. I think it is important that everyone, including those who join us in the gallery, is aware of the fact that Senator Sterle does an outstanding job delivering household items and furniture to those in need in the remote places of Western Australia. I commend Senator Sterle on it, and, to the extent that prices have gone up on diesel, I'm happy to kick in, mate! I'd just make those comments in relation to Senator Sterle.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the reality is that there are cost-of-living pressures which are being faced by Australians all over this country, and the question is: What is going to happen when those Australians go to fill up their cars after the period of the fuel excise being cut in half comes to an end in September? What are they going to do? We're starting to hear stories now—I heard more stories today—of parents, especially in some of our more challenged socioeconomic areas, who are now making choices: 'Do I use that petrol in my car to do the shopping or to go to work, or do I use it to take my son or daughter to sport or to participate in all sorts of events that every child in this country has a right to expect an opportunity to participate in?' The question is: what is the government going to do to practically take action to confront those cost-of-living pressures?</span>

That was the last time that happened. What is the government's plan to address cost-of-living pressures? Australians are being hit from all sides in terms of fuel prices, grocery prices, rental increases, interest rates—they're being hit from all sides. Certainly, during my time in this place, I haven't seen this sort of conflation of all these factors occurring at the same time, hitting Australians in their back pocket.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:31</span>):  I move:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Gallagher) to a question without notice I asked today relating to interest rate increases.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The question focused on interest rates, and, as we've just heard, the Reserve Bank lifted rates again by 50 basis points. Interestingly, last month we heard the Governor of the Reserve Bank basically jawboning down wages, saying that he didn't want to see wages over a particular level. But, no matter how hard I listened and many other Australians listened, we didn't hear the Governor of the Reserve Bank jawboning down corporate profits. That's something that we didn't hear, but we did hear him jawboning down wages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem that we have is that we haven't heard anything of that nature from the Governor of the Reserve Bank, but we also haven't heard anything of that nature from this government. In his statement to the House last week, the Treasurer, Dr Chalmers, neglected to mention the role that corporate profiteering is having on putting upward pressure on inflation in this country. And, despite being asked repeatedly by me in this place, the finance minister, the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Gallagher, has also not acknowledged the role that corporate profiteering is playing on putting upward pressure on interest rates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to be clear that the Greens do acknowledge some of the supply-side issues that are contributing to inflation, which include things like supply chains, a pandemic, war and climate change—although we won't give this government a free pass on climate change, because, let us not forget, it is one of the most fossil fuel addicted governments in the world. We do acknowledge those supply-side shocks, but we want to hear the government start to acknowledge the role that corporate profiteering is playing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's been a class war underway in this country for 40 years, since Hawke and Keating turbocharged neoliberalism in the mid-1980s. And it is absolutely unarguable that the rich, the billionaire class, are winning that war. You only have to look at what happened during the first two years of the pandemic: billionaires stupendously and obscenely increased their wealth as corporate profits went through the roof. It's this corporate profiteering that is helping to push the price of things up. It's the perfect but terrible storm for working people, because wages are going backwards in real terms. Workers' pay packets are shrinking in real terms, just as everything else is getting more expensive. Now we've got the RBA coming in over the top, jacking up rates. And who's going to feel the pain? It's not the billionaires; it's not the superwealthy; it's not the corporations, or most of their shareholders—not on your life! It's not those people. It's not the politicians, all of us in here earning hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, because, remember, Labor's promised we're all going to get a big fat tax cut with the stage 3 income tax cuts. We're going to get looked after. That's $240 billion of expenditure that Labor is committed to that will deliver nothing—literally nothing—to someone on the minimum wage, but we'll all get a big, fat real pay rise. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people who are going to get hurt are the people who can't afford to buy political outcomes. It's recent homebuyers, who paid the highest price in history for their new homes, lulled by a Reserve Bank who told them there would be no interest rate rises for another two years. It's renters, many of whom are already stretched to or beyond breaking point, who will have to suck up, again, another rent rise to pay off their landlord's mortgage. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a better way. Introduce a corporate superprofits tax, address some of that corporate profiteering, help tackle inflation, but use the revenue to help tackle the cost-of-living crisis. Put dental into Medicare. Put mental health into Medicare. Provide free child care. Start looking after the environment that ultimately sustains us all. By treating housing as a human right and not as an investment class, we can ensure that no-one has to worry about the basic right of shelter in this country, and we can help people who are so terribly feeling the pain at the moment. </span>

So we won't be supporting Senator Thorpe's amendment to this particular referral, but we do put on the record that it would be our desire for time lines for reporting back on referrals to committees to be something that be considered in referrals so that we have an understanding of the duration of particular referrals. In recognition of the newness of this committee, Senator Dodson, we will support your motion unamended.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="264449" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHANDLER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:44</span>):  I'm pleased to speak on this matter of public importance on the topic of health, which is consistently the top priority for Australians, including Tasmanians, when it comes to the delivery of government services. In a rural and regional areas around Australia, particularly in my state of Tasmania, one of the constant challenges for small communities is their ability to attract and retain general practitioners. We see this problem regularly affecting communities, particularly in the electorate of Lyons—communities like Ouse, which has been desperately trying to find GP providers to deliver primary care to that community. Indeed, we see the same problem occur regularly around Lyons when a GP in a local practice retires or moves on. When you speak to residents, medical practices and councils in any part of Lyons, whether it's Deloraine, New Norfolk, Brighton, Oatlands or the Tasman Peninsula, this is raised as a concern more often than any other topic. Communities right across Tasmania have experienced the difficulty in finding GPs to live and work in their communities. Of course, in regional areas there is often an older and less mobile population who can't simply get in a car and drive to Hobart or drive to Launceston every time they need to see a doctor. They want to be able to have that service closer to home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a longstanding challenge, and there are no simple solutions. We all understand that in this place. But, in the context of that challenge for regional Tasmania, it was disappointing that the government's main election tactic in Lyons was to spread misinformation about pensioners being forced onto the cashless debit card—misinformation that they continued to spread even after independent fact checks declared it false during the election campaign. When it came to specific health policies, they flew down to Tasmania, re-announced the failed Kevin Rudd GP Super Clinics policy for major cities only, jumped on a plane and left again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Medical Association had a particularly interesting reaction to this GP Super Clinics policy at the time, and I do want to quote the AMA president:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">These centres will do little to relieve the hospital logjam, will further fragment care and will unfairly compete with nearby general practices which, without this government funding, will not be able to keep their doors open after hours.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The president went further:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the plan acknowledges the costs faced by general practices in opening after hours but instead of enabling thousands of practices across the country to improve their offering to patients, it focusses on only 50 practices, using a model reminiscent of the failed Rudd era GP Super Clinics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government policy will unfairly compete with the very general practices that are already having difficulties recruiting and retaining doctors in our region or rural areas. Instead of recognising the great need in those areas of Tasmania—those areas in our regions—the superclinics are to be located only in Hobart, Launceston and Burnie.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The recent decision of the Albanese government to include urban areas in the distribution priority model further exacerbates the difficulty in attracting doctors to rural parts of Tasmania. We now have a situation where incentives designed to attract GPs to move to rural and regional areas can be used for GPs in urban areas like Sydney. Medical practices and organisations in Tasmania have made it clear that, if GPs have a choice between living in a state capital and moving to regional Tasmania, where they are desperately needed by those communities, the likely outcome is doctors will choose the capital city and it will be regional residents that miss out. If GPs who previously had an incentive to work in rural and regional parts of Australia can now get the same incentive for working in an urban area like Sydney or Brisbane then that doesn't help. It doesn't fix the rural workforce issues; it just makes them worse. There is clearly no plan from the Labor government for rural and regional health workforces.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the campaign, they made plenty of noise about the party being more focused on health, but, just like the commitments that they'd reduce the cost of living and power prices for Australians as soon as they got into government, we're all starting to find out that those promises were completely hollow and meaningless.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="259819" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GREEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:49</span>):  I'm very pleased to speak on this incredibly important issue. I don't know if Senator Chandler is a fan of <span style="font-style:italic;">RuPaul's Drag Race</span>—it doesn't really seem like her kind of show—but there's a saying on that show that I want to repeat right now: the cheek, the nerve, the gall, the audacity and the gumption! How dare those opposite come in here and talk about the GP crisis. How dare they come in here and talk about primary health care. How dare they come in here and lecture this government about how hard it is to see a GP in rural and regional areas. We know, after nine years of neglect, that they created this problem, they made it worse, they refused to acknowledge it and they refused to do anything about it. It is absolutely disgraceful that they are now standing here and demanding plans and talking about action, when they did absolutely nothing for nine years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government care about people in rural and regional areas, and we care deeply about fixing the GP crisis. I can tell you from my conversations with people in regional Queensland that it is very well known that, under the former government, people in Emerald had to wait 12 weeks to see a GP. That means there are people right now who made an appointment when the last government was in power and are still waiting to get that appointment. The Labor government has been in power for 10 weeks; people in Emerald have to wait 12 weeks to see a GP. When those opposite were in government, they refused to do anything about this. They cut Medicare, froze the Medicare rebate and drove primary health care into the ground. They refused to acknowledge that there was even an issue. When we moved a motion in the Senate to establish an inquiry to look into this issue, they voted against it. This is an issue that was created by the former government and it is an issue that the Labor government will fix. It is an issue that the Labor government cares deeply about and has a plan to fix. But it is absolutely appalling for those opposite to come in here and talk about this issue. I thank Senator Chandler for raising it. I can't think of another matter of public importance ever debated on the floor of this chamber that was more like a dorothy dixer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've been meeting with doctors and practice managers all across the country and with admin staff who are answering phones, and they tell us they are working incredibly hard and are just overwhelmed. That is the situation that was left behind. In the conversations I have with people working in the industry, I can tell that they are desperate, and I know the community is absolutely desperate. When you can't see a GP, where do you go? You end up in the emergency department at your local hospital. We saw this time and time again through the COVID crisis—complete denial by those opposite that the lack of GP access had anything to do with emergency departments being full. They refused even to acknowledge that it was an issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The former government failed to improve the dire situation facing rural and regional areas; in fact, they contributed to making it worse. The lack of doctors and other medical professionals in these communities across Australia is not a new problem. It has been around for a very long time. A series of decisions by the former government during the pandemic meant that we had a spotlight put on this issue finally—thank goodness!—but people were left with no healthcare options in their community. We want to see practical, positive solutions on the table to make sure people have access to quality health care regardless of where they live. We were noisy during the campaign and we were noisy in opposition because we knew that the government refused to acknowledge they had a crisis on their hands. We on this side of the chamber believe that, if you have a Medicare card, you should be able to use it, but that is not the present situation for people living in rural and regional areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge the many people—individual residents, GPs, peak bodies, academics and others—who took time to engage with the Senate committee process, whether it was through a written submission or providing evidence at a public hearing. We heard your call. We listened. The Labor senators on that committee listened to the evidence that was being given. And here is what our government will do. I can assure the Senate that the Albanese government is committed to investing in general practice and strengthening Medicare with an almost $1 billion investment. Our Strengthening Medicare Taskforce will identify the best ways to boost affordability, improve access and deliver better support for patients with ongoing and chronic illness, backed by the $750 million in the Strengthening Medicare Fund. We made this commitment before the election and we've moved quickly. The Minister for Health and Aged Care has already appointed members to the task force and they are getting straight to work. We are working with the experts. We are making sure the experts are around the table and we are taking their advice. We are listening—something those opposite failed to do. The task force brings together Australia's health policy leaders, health professionals, and includes consumer, rural and regional, and, importantly, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander representatives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of that we're working tirelessly to ensure doctors have the resources to invest in their GP practices. We're making sure the $220 million in the Strengthening Medicare GP Grants program is available to GPs to invest in their businesses. We're also investing $146 million to attract and retain more healthcare workers to rural and regional Australia, for improving training and incentive programs and supporting developing innovative models of multidisciplinary care. And our 50 Medicare urgent clinics across the country will be bulk-billed and will take pressure off the hospital system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite can trot out whatever quotes they want from anybody, but you know what really matters: this is a policy that people in rural and regional Australia voted for. They care about these clinics. They want these clinics in their community. When you have a sick child, when you have a sick baby, and the only place you can take that child is to an emergency department, that is an indication the primary healthcare system is not working—and it wasn't working under the previous government. This is an incredibly serious issue, and it's why we are taking it so seriously. It's why we are investing in our healthcare system. It's also why we have made sure there is a distribution priority area classification system to recognise 700 areas for which either full or partial DPA classification is required.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have not wasted any time. Our government has moved quickly and decisively when it comes to improving this crisis. We have been listening to Australians—something those opposite stopped doing years ago. We know it is hard to see a GP. We know the cost of medicines has been high, which is why health care is high on our agenda. We will reduce the cost of medicines to improve the cost of living and make it easier for people to access medicines under our government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, can I say, on a local level, that in my hometown of Cairns we are investing in rural GP places at the James Cook University. We know this is a problem that cannot be fixed overnight but if we train local doctors in rural and regional areas—something the former government refused to do—we can make sure we have a generation of doctors who stay in the regions because they've been trained in the regions. This is a commitment we made on a local level but it shows this government is planning on doing the hard, long-term work to fix this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say, coming back to the mover of this MPI: never in my life have I seen more hypocrisy than in this MPI, moved by a former government that refused to do anything when it came to rural and regional GP access, that voted against a Senate inquiry, that cut Medicare telehealth appointments so that people in rural and regional areas could not access telehealth, that froze the Medicare rebate, that drove primary health care into the ground and that even refused to acknowledge that this was a crisis because they voted against a Senate inquiry seeking to look into this issue. The evidence of what the former government did is on the table. And the plans from the Albanese Labor government are clear. It is what people in Australia voted for. It was the thing that got people to change their mind. It was the thing that made them change the government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="155410" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:59</span>):  There is no doubt the shortage of healthcare workers, including GPs, in rural and regional Australia is at absolute crisis point. We have got a massive problem, which is absolutely a sign of failure of the previous government. The previous government led us to a situation where now the crisis point is so obvious that anybody in rural and regional Australia that talks to you about access to GPs and healthcare practitioners will tell you that it is a huge problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The question that I find really juicy, that we need to talk about today, is what we do about it. What measures are going to be put in place by this new government to actually, seriously address that problem?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I chaired the inquiry by the Senate Community Affairs References Committee into the provision of general practitioners in outer metropolitan, rural and regional Australia, and we travelled quite widely across regional Australia. I'm hoping that that inquiry will be re-referred to the community affairs committee so that we can continue our investigations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was eye-opening, during those hearings, to hear countless health practitioners share their concerns about the lack of access to timely and affordable health care—particularly to GPs in the bush—and to hear of the consequences for people's health. One doctor from coastal New South Wales told us: 'We're at breaking point, trying to service the needs of our community with a depleting number of very tired and very stressed doctors.' We've got doctors in rural areas working 80 or more hours a week. We've got people waiting for weeks to see their GPs. And then there's just zero accessibility to allied health practitioners. We've got a massive problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our committee recommended that the government investigates substantially increasing the Medicare rebates for all levels of general practice consultations, as well as other general-practice funding options, and that we review the primary-care components of the medical education curriculum with a view to ensuring that general practice is a core component of the curriculum. These were consensus recommendations of that committee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, fundamentally, what we need to do is to properly fund and support health care across the board. That means actually putting the money into health care, and it means doing things like putting dental care and mental care into Medicare. It means actually spending the money and it means raising the money—it means actually saying: 'Yes, we should have a corporate superprofits tax. We should have a tax on billionaires. We should scrap the stage 3 tax cuts, which are going to cost the budget bottom line over $200 billion over the next 10 years'—and putting that money into services such as health care, education and income support, the services that the people of Australia really need. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="243273" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RUSTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:02</span>):  I rise today first of all to acknowledge the extraordinary effort of our medical workforce—particularly over the last 2½ years, as they have single-handedly battled in the frontline response to the COVID pandemic—and there is nowhere where these health workers have worked harder, longer or more diligently than in rural, regional and, particularly, remote Australia. I think all Australians owe a huge debt of gratitude to all of our healthcare workers across the whole country, and I would like to add the weight of our parties, the parties of the coalition, to that, as to their amazing efforts, and to thank them very much for what they have done on behalf of all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition absolutely acknowledges that there are huge challenges out there at the moment in our health workforce, exacerbated significantly by the challenges that have been put forward by COVID but also because of the changing nature and landscape of rural and regional Australia. That's why, in government, we invested very heavily in making sure that we had started to put in place the things that needed to be done to make sure that we could continue the rebuild on a strong rural, regional and remote workforce. We acknowledge that there is still a long way to go, and we hope that those opposite who are now in government will continue to make sure that they prioritise rural, regional and remote health as one of the priorities of the new government, because it was something that we prioritised as the previous government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We still find ourselves with great challenges—not the least of which is the fact that we no longer have access to an external workforce from overseas because of our borders having not been open for such a long period of time, and the lack of a response, as to seeing our borders reopen, and the lack of encouragement for people to come to Australia. We are still waiting for the jobs summit before that, apparently, is going to happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In government we invested a billion dollars specifically into our rural and regional health sector—including into making sure, through our Stronger Rural Health Strategy, that we were encouraging more health professionals to move into rural and regional Australia. Since we put this in place, in the space of five years, over 5,000 GPs, nurses and other allied health workers were recruited to work in rural, regional and remote Australia in support of those people who choose to live outside our capital cities—making sure that they have access to appropriate health services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just in this last budget we added another $300 million to the previous investments for things like making sure that we were getting access to MRIs in rural and regional Australia so that people who live there did not have to travel to capital cities in order to get this really important treatment that's able to be accessed through this particular technology. We also made sure that we were continuing to invest heavily in making sure that there were Commonwealth funded places for medical students training to be GPs in rural and regional locations, because we know that people who train in rural and regional locations are much more likely to stay in those locations and support their communities once they have finished their studies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We established two new university departments of rural health, at Edith Cowan University and in the Goldfields at Curtin University in Western Australia. We also invested through the Charles Sturt University's Rural Clinical School, and we also committed additional funding to the Rural Health Medical Training Program. Another thing that we committed to, understanding that the health outcomes in rural and regional Australia are often challenged by the tyranny of distance, was to continue to invest in Australia's favourite, I think, when it comes to rural and regional health services: the Royal Flying Doctor Service. This means that we have, over 10 years, invested nearly $1 billion in the RFDS, as well as in other flight services that have supported so many sick Australians through CareFlight and Little Wings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we stand by our track record of supporting rural and regional Australia, but we also understand that rural and regional Australia continues to suffer under some very significant pressures for workforce. Some of those have been exacerbated by some of the actions of the incoming government—which did not need to happen. Just as an example: one of the first things that the Labor government chose to do was to cut almost 70 telehealth services that had been put in place to enable access by telephone to your GP, recognising that, at the time they were put in, people often either could not get to a GP or there were health reasons why they did not want to interact in the broader community. So telephone was one of the ways in which they could interact. In removing the telephone consultations without proper reason, rationale or advice—well, if there is, we haven't seen it—we have now excluded, disproportionately, people who live in rural and regional areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, many people who live in rural and regional areas do not have videoconferencing opportunities, so they can't access their doctor by video. Their telephone line was the lifeline that they had to their health services during COVID. Seventy of these services have been cut, particularly for people with the most chronic need for health support. We condemn the decision to do that without proper advice. As I said, if there is advice, that has not been provided for transparency as to why that decision was made at the time that it was made—particularly when we were entering into a new wave of the COVID pandemic when, once again, Australians were needing the support, protections and measures that the COVID measures had put in place. We would also say that one of the great revolutions of the COVID pandemic was telehealth. During the first two years of the pandemic, over 100 million consultations took place over telehealth, absolutely transforming Australia's healthcare system. It's something that has been of disproportionate benefit to people who live in rural and regional Australia because often they are a very long way away from the services that they have to access, if they have to do so in person.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another issue that has been raised, significantly, around rural and regional health has been around the Distribution Priority Area classifications. Previously, this was put in place because we knew of the difficulty in attracting overseas doctors to go to rural and regional areas. By putting in place a mechanism that prioritised rural and regional areas for access to this particular workforce, we sought to encourage more people to go to the regions and, in doing so, alleviate some of the pressure that was on our health system because of a lack of doctors. The decision by this government to expand those DPA areas means that a possible unintended consequence is going to be that those outer metropolitan areas and larger regional centres that have now got access to the DPA classification are likely to be sucking the doctors out of those regional and rural communities which are further out and which can least afford to have those health services or those GPs removed from them. These kinds of decisions impact immensely on rural and regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another issue I would put on the record that indicates that this government before us has got no regard for what happens in rural and regional Australia is around its urgent care clinics. They were supposed to be prioritised into areas that had very low numbers of GPs to improve access to GPs for the people that live in those communities. During the election campaign, one of the areas that was nominated as a location for an urgent care clinic was Macnamara. Macnamara is an inner-city Melbourne electorate. Not only is it an inner-city Melbourne electorate but it actually has a ratio of doctors to patients three times higher than the average in rural and regional Australia, so you would have to question the logic behind the rationale of those opposite when, instead of supporting with incentives getting more GPs into areas where there are low numbers, they're actually prioritising protecting their own marginal electorates from an onslaught from the Greens by putting urgent care clinics into an electorate that already has three times the average number of GPs of many of our rural and regional settings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the motion before us today concerning the failure of the government to outline any meaningful plans, I would say that the only plans that they've outlined so far have had a detrimental effect on the rural and regional workforce, particularly our GPs, and the only things that we have before us are for strengthening Medicare. What does that mean? We've got $1 billion put against it and we have no idea where that $1 billion is going to go. If our urgent care clinics are any indication of the kinds of activities that that $1 billion is going to be spent on, I wouldn't be holding my breath that it's going to go to rural and regional Australia. I'd be suggesting we'll be seeing it spent in metropolitan areas. I hope that's not the case, and I plead with those opposite: rural, regional and remote Australia needs your help. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  This is not my first speech. It's my first opportunity to put on record how frustrating I find this. Maybe I'm the only one who is sick to the gills of it, but we're spending an hour making speeches about how big a problem the rural GP shortage is. Couldn't we spend an hour actually doing something about it? It's hard to put into words how disconnected this all feels. The Liberals are getting up and saying that this problem is all Labor's fault. Labor is getting up and saying it's the Liberals' fault. Does it matter? This isn't about you. The big parties see every problem as the fault of the other side. Nobody ever stands up and says: 'This is our mess. This is our problem to fix.' Everybody here thinks they're cleaners sent in to tidy up after somebody else. It's painful to watch.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When regional communities lose doctors, they don't survive for long. If you're sick and you need a doctor and there isn't one where you are, you leave. You go where you need to go. And, if you need to see the doctor again, you leave again. Sooner or later, you move closer to where you need to be. That's when you leave for good. That's what we're seeing in Tasmania. It's happening in Rosebery, it's happening in Ouse and it's even happening in Dover. The song is the same across Tasmania: doctors are leaving and nobody is replacing them. Communities are crying out for help. People are flying to the mainland because that's the only way they're going to see someone quickly. What are you supposed to do if you can't afford a return airfare? What if you're too sick to get on a plane in the first place? And all we hear from the major parties is arguments over whose fault it is. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Titanic </span>is sinking around you, and you're arguing about who's supposed to be on the lookout for icebergs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got a well-intentioned policy to attract GPs to rural and regional areas, but it's obviously not working because it doesn't push GPs to work in areas where they're needed the most, and the slack is falling on local councils to pick up. Local councils are paying doctors to work in their area. They're paying to upgrade medical centres. They're offering free houses to GPs. They're paying for their office equipment, their cars, their fuel and even their phone bills. Not every council can afford to do this, and, if you can't afford to compete with the larger councils, if you can't afford to offer the same benefits to GPs, you just don't get a doctor. You go without, and that's not good enough. This is not good enough. How are we supposed to pat ourselves on the back and say, 'Job done, move on,' when only wealthy communities can afford a GP? There's a word for that, and it's 'failure'. It's a failure of everyone here, on every side of the debate—major party, minor party and independent. Until it's fixed for everyone, it's at the feet of everyone to fix it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to start fixing it. I'm open to how we do it. Maybe we can offer full scholarships to young people in areas that need GPs the most, so long as they commit to returning home when they graduate with a medical degree. Maybe we can let pharmacists do more in high-need areas to take some of the burden off existing GPs. Maybe the way we classify the needs of communities has to change. In rural Tassie, about four in five doctors have been trained overseas. When we try to attract new doctors, we're competing with the rest of the world. Maybe the federal government needs to get into our corner and help us win the race for the talent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you've got ideas, if you want to work with me, my door is open. We can do it quietly—you can even take the credit. I don't care. Senator Lambie doesn't care. Just work with us. My office might be on the other side of the building, but it's not impossible to find. Knock on my door; I'll open it. I want to have a chat.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:16</span>):  I rise to speak on this very important MPI brought before the chamber by Senator Chandler. From day one, the Albanese Labor government proved that they do not care about regional Australia. They have proven this time and again, and we're only two months into this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me give you the clearest example of this. Last week the Albanese Labor government decided to axe the Joint Standing Committee on Northern Australia and the Office of Northern Australia. They abandoned northern Australia on day one of parliament. One of our key regional areas across Australia is in the north. They made their view on the importance of rural and regional Australia very clear—that is, that they do not care about rural and regional Australia. Now, by their failure to act or to outline any meaningful plan to address rural and regional workforce shortages in the health sector, they continue to fail our rural and regional communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our rural and regional communities face significant challenges and inequalities. There is still a great divide between the city and the country. As my colleague in the other place the member for Calare, Mr Gee, said only yesterday, there is a divide in income opportunities and outcomes, and, if you live in a country area, your income will not be as high as if you lived in the city. There is a divide in educational opportunities between the city and the country, and there is a divide in health outcomes. What do we know? The cold hard truth is that the further away from the city you live, the younger you will die. The average life expectancy in the country is lower than in the city. It has been noted by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare that life expectancy decreases with remoteness. They've also noted that potentially avoidable hospitalisations can be 2.5 times higher in remote areas than in cities. Australians living in remote communities face higher levels of difficulty in accessing medical services, including GPs. And, while some of the reasons for this are outside of the control of the healthcare sector, access to health services plays an important part.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is about to get much, much more difficult for our rural and regional Australians. We know that the availability of medical practitioners—particularly GPs—has a direct impact on the health outcomes in regional, rural and remote Australia. This is why we have distribution priority areas—to help identify areas in regional, rural and remote communities with unmet needs, and which are lacking important access to services by GPs. There are benefits to having DPA status. It ensures that these areas, which are lacking access to GP services, are looked after, by bringing in trained medical practitioners from overseas and participants in the Bonded Medical Program and requiring them to set up in these areas to help reduce that division between the city and the country. The DPA is crucial to the rural healthcare system, and it's the backbone of these communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, despite strong opposition from rural doctors, the Albanese Labor government is pushing ahead with their 'ill-informed' plan—as it was described by the Rural Doctors Association of Australia—to expand distribution priority areas to include peri-urban and outer-metro areas. Labor have now expanded DPAs to include large regional centres and outer-metro areas. They are taking away from our rural and regional communities, abandoning patients in rural and regional communities, who will be left with no access to services that are close to their homes—no access at all. They're 'robbing Peter to pay Paul'—that's how the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners described it, because the RACGP know that there is an extreme risk that rural and regional communities will lose doctors as they take up positions that are closer to the cities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I mean, you can't blame them, really, if you're not providing those incentives and that direct support that is available to ensure that we are attracting good doctors into these remote and regional settings. This is an unintended and unwanted consequence of this ill-informed decision made by an Albanese Labor government. Despite what they've been told by those working in our rural and regional healthcare sector, they're persisting with this policy. What they should be doing is looking to encourage more of our medical students and our future doctors to choose general practice as their career, whether this is through cutting red tape or making easier and more attractive career pathways for our students. Whatever it is, they will not solve the GP shortage in rural and regional Australia by taking away from our rural and regional communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the brief time that I have remaining in this MPI discussion, I want to give a shout-out to the More Than Mining campaign. This is a particular initiative that's been driven primarily by the mining industry communities, or communities that have resources-sector jobs that are close by. They're advocating for a change to how we treat the fringe benefits tax. One of the big issues in attracting staff to these areas is housing and access to affordable housing, particularly in a market that's cyclical because of the boom-and-bust cycle. In this moment here, in the remaining time for this MPI—the 30 seconds that I've got left—I just want to give a shout-out to those that have been advocating for this program. I remain committed to this. I think they've got some innovative ideas. Whether it's precisely the solution that they've come up with or, quite possibly, a variation of that, I think it's something that we should look closely at in enabling people that are choosing to put their roots down in regional communities to get a tax benefit in choosing to purchase homes and rent homes in these places. To increase the pool of homes that are available, to increase the stock that's available, could be a good way of actually attracting staff into these areas. I want to commend the More Than Mining campaign and the communities that have been supporting it.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of Pauline Hanson's One Nation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:23</span>):  I thank Senator Chandler for bringing this matter to the attention of the Senate, although I am compelled to point out that the shortage of general practitioners in rural and regional Australia is a problem the coalition failed to address during the nine years it was in power. This crisis is not only risking the health and wellbeing of Australians who live in rural and regional areas; it is costing taxpayers and the economy a great deal of money. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In June this year, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Courier Mail</span> newspaper revealed Queensland taxpayers were funding pay packages of up to $1 million a year—for each doctor—to fly in locum doctors to plug gaps in health services delivery across the state. They have been recruited in desperation, with regional hospitals in Queensland sometimes being forced to turn patients away for the lack of a doctor. Rural generalists have been offered $2,700 per day to work in Wide Bay. Radiologists have been offered up to $4,000 per day to work as locums on the Sunshine Coast. The total outlay for these fly-in locums was $118 million last year, and this cost is rising. The Queensland government spent $34 million on locums in the first quarter of this year, and it's not working. When you're sick you have the right to see a doctor there and then, not after you've recovered. But waiting times for GP appointments in regional Queensland have blown out to months. People are travelling long distances in order to see a doctor more quickly. The town of Moura in Central Queensland hasn't had a permanent GP since December and went without a doctor for more than a week back in March. Local residents were forced to resort to telehealth appointments or else drive 65 kilometres to Biloela to see a doctor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's no wonder doctors are leaving regional areas: the workload is horrendous and many are burnt out or exhausted. And it's not just doctors: there are shortages of a wide range of health practitioners—nurses, midwives, pharmacists, dentists, optometrists, psychologists and occupational therapists are all in short supply. Then there's aged and palliative care; the lack of these services in regional Queensland is appalling. There is not a single hospice in Queensland located north of the Sunshine Coast. This is why I fought tooth and nail for $8 million to build the Fitzroy Community Hospice in Rockhampton, and I hope the Albanese government doesn't cut out that funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must do more to encourage and incentivise Australians to study medicine and to practice in the country. Importing doctors is not the solution. Up to 12,000 foreign doctors are in Australia and have applied to work here but cannot pass the standards required and many cannot even speak English, which risks misdiagnosis and adverse medical outcomes if they are ever to be allowed to work here. It is also worth noting here the impact of COVID-19 vaccine mandates: many are not allowed to treat patients because they have not taken the wonder jab. Isn't it amazing that bureaucrats think they know more than doctors about the safety and efficiency of the wonder jab?</span>

For a representative of a party that, while in power, dismantled and starved our rural and regional health workforce of funding and employment opportunities, to bring on an MPI on this topic, to my mind, was extraordinary. I will go into the detail and unpack that—perhaps they were taking more credit in looking at their own policies in a blinkered way without seeing what was going on?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw years of neglect of our Medicare system by the coalition. In my own home state, if you look at rural and regional Western Australia, the spending on Medicare per head of population is proportionately so much lower than anyone in a metropolitan area. People do not have access in rural and regional Western Australia to the health professionals, such as doctors and specialists, that they should be able to go and see. The lack of access to health professions is very much reflected in the per head spending on Medicare around regional WA when compared to the Perth metropolitan area. So I wonder, really, what's going on in the heads of those opposite. While, in your time in government, you ripped billions of dollars out of primary care and caused gap fees to rocket, so we will clean up that mess left by the Liberal Party—but this is not going to be easy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last government arbitrarily axed the ability of a long list of communities to recruit overseas trained doctors to fill gaps in general practice as well as those in outer suburbs and the regions. There's a dire need not only in regional WA but also in Perth communities. In Western Australia last year a well-known paediatrician died, a paediatrician who had a high case load. As a result of that, the waiting list to get in to see a paediatrician blew out for everyone by more than a year. It wouldn't matter if you were a high-needs family or child or not; you could not get in to see a paediatrician for more than a year. This is the legacy of the historical underfunding of our medical—</span>

                  </a>  So the Labor Party initiated the Senate inquiry into GP shortages in the last parliament. We heard mountains and mountains of evidence from people not being able to see a GP at all, about having to wait many months for an appointment, having to travel hours when they finally do get to see one. This is why Labor has deliberately not changed the regional incentive payments that doctors receive for working in remote Australia. It's why we recognise the importance of providing additional incentives for doctors to work in those remote and regional communities. So I find this extraordinary that Senator Chandler, now that she's lost the power of being in government on these issues, suddenly appears interested in these issues. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government funds a range of program incentives to encourage GPs to relocate and work there, in addition to the distribution priority area program. So, while we have this architecture, we know that we have to prioritise improving it. We have our Strengthening Medicare Taskforce now. This task force met last Friday. It's tasked with finding the best ways to boost affordability, improve access and deliver better support for patients, especially for payments with ongoing and chronic illnesses. This work, their work and their findings, will be backed by the $750 million Strengthening Medicare Fund. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that our health professionals have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic. They are working tirelessly now. I have two aged parents—one of whom has significant health conditions—who are at home in quarantine, as they recently tested positive with COVID. But they have a good GP that's checking in on them, and they also have the resourcing of the state government. We know it's critically important that we resource our doctors to look after Australians, to provide them with the care they need. This is, in particular, why we are investing some $220 million in GP practices around Australia. This will be incredibly important to rural and regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have a plan to invest $146 million to attract health workers to, and retain them in, rural and regional Australia. This includes improving training and incentive programs and supporting the development of innovative models of multidisciplinary care. We are going to boost workforce incentives for rural and regional GPs to support the engagement of nurses, allied health and other health professionals and provide multidisciplinary team based care—also critically important. We are also going to expand the innovative models of the collaborative care program across rural and regional Australia because we know support to retain our rural health professionals is absolutely critical.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many practical steps that governments can and should take to support the rural and regional workforce here in Australia. This includes, for example, the case of a constituent that recently came through my office, where the only psychiatrist in the Pilbara in Western Australia that is there to service, and is qualified to meet, the needs of children can't stay in Australia because she has a child with autism. Clearly the state government is now making appeals to the Commonwealth government, saying, 'These are the kinds of issues that we need to fix.' And I know, sitting on the government benches, that these are indeed the kinds of issues which we need to fix and on which your government, on a day-to-day basis, was absolutely missing in action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also here to expand the John Flynn Prevocational Doctor Program to more than 1,000 placements in rural and regional Australia per year and to strengthen rural generalist and GP registrar training as well as to provide Australians access to universal, prompt, world-class medical care—something that has been ignored by those opposite for too long. We want to see our rural and regional communities right around Australia get the access they deserve to universal, prompt, world-class medical care. No-one in our nation deserves to face a multiyear wait for vital treatments simply due to where they live.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst I can see that those opposite recognise these issues now that they're in opposition, I am very pleased to stand up here and debate them on it. You were silent for eight years on all these issues. Not once did I come in here and see you prioritise these needs. Instead, we got the glib 'all announcement and no delivery'. The proof will be in the pudding. We are early in our term and we know we have to get on and implement these measures, whereas those opposite were all announcement and no delivery year after year. We in the Labor Party are here with a commitment to building our public healthcare system right across remote and regional Australia. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I was very relieved to hear that the new government will be continuing the former coalition government's model of multidisciplinary team based care, which I had the pleasure of announcing the pilot for under the former regional health minister, Mark Coulton. So I'm very pleased that our coalition government policy will be continued.</span>

I hope that includes the rural generalist pathways for registered nurses and allied health professionals as well. I didn't hear whether the new government will continue, as we termed in the pilot, the Murrumbidgee single employer model, which improves the working conditions and the contractual arrangements for GPs who move to regional areas. That was something that our government implemented.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I didn't hear from Senator Pratt is how the new government's changes to the distribution priority areas are going to help us achieve an increase in the rural and regional health workforce. How can the new government look people in the eye and say that an overseas trained doctor should get the same incentives and benefits to work in Newcastle as they would if they were going to work in a GP clinic in Cessnock or Scone? How can they say that they're putting these hard-fought for, overseas trained doctors in bonded Australian medical places in Western Sydney compared to Broken Hill or Bourke? It doesn't stack up. There are already significant inequalities—yes, our government was in place for nine years and, yes, we put in the hard yards, because there is no silver bullet on this issue. We acknowledge there is no silver bullet. But we worked very hard talking to the Rural Doctors Association, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the allied health professionals on how to address this issue, on how to train more in the regions and retain more in the regions.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This one policy announcement by the new government has the Rural Doctors Association of Australia now warning that they are 'fearful' for rural communities right across Australia that are now at extreme risk of losing their doctors as they take up positions closer to the cities, abandoning their rural and remote patients who will be left with no access to care close to home. They went further and made a harrowing call that Labor's policies will cost the lives of rural and remote patients who already suffer poorer health outcomes than their city counterparts.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just this afternoon I had a meeting with council representatives from Far North Queensland. They told the story of how, in their small community, they have a doctor, they have a district nurse and they have a policeman, but if there is a road trauma or an accident overnight due to workplace fatigue management—which is a very serious issue in regional areas—there is a snowball effect. They would love to have the extra workforce. But how can they compete if we're saying that the distribution priority areas can have someone in Townsville rather than in remote Far North Queensland?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to speak briefly to a couple of the assessments by the Commonwealth Ombudsman under section 486O of the Migration Act. This goes directly to the length of time that people are spending in immigration detention. Assessment No. 8 of 2022 by the Commonwealth Ombudsman has the case of ID—of course, names are redacted in these reports, and rightly so. This is the tenth assessment for this particular person, who has been in immigration detention for nine years. Nine years in immigration detention! There's another case in a report tabled today of someone who has been in immigration detention for more than three years, who arrived in Australia with his family on a humanitarian visa.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge that we've got a new government in place, and I think the minister has to be given an opportunity to come to grips with this situation, but I'm aware of cases where people have been in immigration detention in this country for over a decade. There are stateless people who are in immigration detention, and who have been in immigration detention in Australia for years. I've spent a lot of time in this place—in my view, rightfully so—talking about the horrors of offshore detention. I visited Manus Island on multiple occasions. I was there when Mr Dutton, from the other place, ordered the Papua New Guinea government to cut off the food, the drinking water, the electricity and the medical support. I actually went into the Manus Island detention centre on the first day those basics of life were cut off for over 650 desperate people—who, by the way, conducted an absolutely heroic resistance to that brutality ordered by the Liberal government and Minister Dutton at the time. But I think that the time has come for us to start to also focus on immigration detention onshore in Australia, and the depravity of that arbitrary indefinite detention. Many people are there due to ministerial whim. It's the minister who, with the stroke of a pen, has condemned them to years of detention, and it's the minister who could, with the stroke of a pen, release them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are dark and bloody days in our country's history. The immigration detention regime that we've seen both offshore and onshore in the last decade is a foul chapter in our country's story. There's only one thing that's going to clean it up. There's only one thing that's going to make sure to clean up the depravity and the brutality—and these are systems by design that are brutal. They are systems designed to deliberately harm innocent people. Remember, this is administrative detention—it's not as a result of a sentence by the courts. There's only one thing that's going to let us put a broom through this brutality, to hold people to account and, most importantly, make sure this never happens again, and that is a royal commission into immigration detention.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to start by acknowledging that we are on Ngunawal country. I'd like to pay my respect to their elders past and present. I'd also like to acknowledge all First Nations people here this afternoon. It's a privilege to call Ngunawal country home. Canberra, the 'meeting place' of our nation, is usually talked about as a young city, but we live in a place that has been inhabited and looked after for tens of thousands of years, hundreds and hundreds of generations. We live in a country with an enviable democracy, a vibrant multicultural community, overachievers on the world stage, abundant natural resources, staggering—if unequally distributed—national wealth, awe-inspiring beauty and the oldest continuous living cultures in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like many Australians, I came here from distant shores. The story of Zimbabwe is one that is well known. My own family story has been told many times. This is not a story of my family alone but of so many families who now call Australia home. I am grateful to my mum and dad, Andy and Jane, who are here this afternoon, for leaving all they knew to give me and my brothers more opportunity. Again, there are many others who have done this. I would like to acknowledge the contribution immigrants continue to make to our country. I am obviously white—moon-tan white, as many of my former teammates would remind me!—and I don't want to conflate my experiences of migration with the many migrants whose experience is shaped by the colour of their skin. We are making progress as a country, but it's in all of our interests to continue doing the work to build a more inclusive society that celebrates difference and diversity. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I grew up on a farm, and despite seeing the challenges of farming—like a freak hailstorm destroying our crops the week before we started picking, and you've got a massive overdraft—agriculture's always drawn my attention, pulling me back time and again. Growing up on a farm instilled in me the importance of hard work and an understanding of how small and insignificant we are, in the face of nature—how at the mercy of the elements we are. It also sparked in me a love of nature and a fascination with the natural world. Unable to escape the pull of our relationship with the land, I went on to study ag and have been involved in farming and conservation projects. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While our modern national psyche may be more and more urbanised, and, collectively, we may no longer consider ourselves an agricultural society or deeply connected to the land, we still are. There is no civilisation, as we know it, without agriculture. Our society cannot be sustained without the people who spend their life on the land, whose blood, sweat and tears and generations of knowledge help feed and clothe us—farmers who love their land and need our recognition and support. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are part of nature, and our long-term wellbeing as families, communities and nations is totally linked to our ability to cooperate with one another, to meet our needs, to build communities based on respect and equality, while also maintaining the health of the land that sustains us. As we know, we aren't doing a particularly good job at this, and, as a result, we're facing some serious challenges. Like many colleagues here in the Senate, I stand here wanting to take on these challenges, to find ways to build the kind of future where we can all thrive. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I stand here as a result of the work of the many others, of proACT, Canberra's very own 'Voices of' movement, led by Clare Doube, Glenn Cummings, Laurie Dunn, Steph Harvey, Cam Reid and others. This group of Canberrans were frustrated with politics and dared to believe that they could change it. My success was due to the more than 2,000 amazing volunteers—some of them joining us today—who joined the campaign. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite what you see on the news, Canberra is so much more than the sum of the decisions made in this building. Yes, we're a city of roundabouts and politicians, but we're also so much more than that. We're a growing city with a strong community spirit, built on a passion for lifelong learning, good public policy, a connection to our environment, the arts, sport, defence, science and technology. We're appropriately called the bush capital, from Namadgi and Tidbinbilla down south all the way up to Mulligans Flat in the north, and all the other places that we know and love. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a vibrant and growing multicultural community. We're also home to five universities, hosting tens of thousands of students with researchers and young leaders tackling some of our most complex problems. Universities should be accessible and affordable to all who want to study, regardless of their background or chosen field. We must continue to fund research for the public good. As the pandemic so starkly highlighted, our need for this is great and ongoing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Canberrans work in complete service to our nation: the world-leading scientists at the CSIRO and their tireless contribution in research and helping solve the problems we face; those serving our nation in defence, from ADFA to Duntroon and the thousands working on our physical and cybersecurity; our public servants—some 60,000 dedicated, professional, passionate people who work for our communities across more than a hundred federal departments and agencies; and our national institutions that tell the stories of where we've come from and who we are. We're also a city of tradies, nurses, teachers, hospo workers, service staff of all kinds, construction workers, professionals and innovators. No matter what job Canberrans do, they care about the future of this city. They care about the people who live there and they care about making our whole country better. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why, when I was asked by people in our community to have this first speech live-translated into Auslan, I didn't hesitate to say yes. So thank you, Mandy, for being here today and translating my words. I understand that the difference between Mandy being there in the broadcasting studio and here on the floor of the chamber is the difference between accessibility and inclusion. Today we've achieved the former but not the latter, and in future I hope we can achieve both.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our territory faces many of the challenges faced in other parts of the country. We're in the midst of a housing crisis. We struggle to attract and retain the healthcare workers needed to care for our growing population. Our businesses are struggling to find staff and keep their doors open. Too many of our elderly have been left without dignity in the very facilities designed to care for them. So many people have had to fight for the support they need under the NDIS. The cost-of-living crisis is creating a new class of working poor—and, in some cases, working homeless—in our suburbs. People in our community face mental health challenges, often without the funds or ability to access the services they need to get help. Too many are employed in insecure work, leaving them vulnerable to the rapidly changing economic conditions. The changing climate is changing our lands, making us more prone to extreme heat and bushfires, severe weather events and species extinction. Invasive species are destroying our unique habitats and wildlife. These are all challenges that are being felt across the country. We share in them. We understand them. And we want a hand and a voice in solving them, for the benefit of our community and the nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here in the ACT, we've been denied rights held by the states. It's time for us to restore the right of the territories to make decisions for themselves—to ensure that our Legislative Assembly here in the ACT gets to make decisions about the future of Canberrans, not MPs from around the country whose own constituents already enjoy these same rights. Yesterday, legislation to restore our rights as a territory was introduced into the House of Representatives. This is not the first time the parliament has tried to repeal the Andrews bill, but I hope it will be the last. I will work with everyone in the Senate chamber to support a vote giving us equality with the states. I would like to acknowledge the many brave, courageous people who have supported this campaign over many years and those I spoke to ahead of the election—not least of all, those who decided to speak out, including Samuel Whitsed and Sam Delaney, who I'm honoured to have here today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Beyond territory rights, there are many issues before us. With trust in political institutions at worrying lows, this parliament has the opportunity to begin to restore the faith of Australians in both government and governance. From increasing transparency to the implementation of a robust integrity commission, to reforming political donations and truth in political advertising laws, we have a real chance to strengthen our democracy and ensure Australians can trust in the decisions that are being made in their name. We also need greater protection for whistleblowers who take great risks in service of the public good.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have an opportunity to enshrine in our Constitution a First Nations voice to parliament. The Uluru Statement from the Heart is a generous offer to all Australians to enshrine a voice that can guide the treaty-making and truth-telling process that we need, to move towards reconciliation. Aunty Pat Anderson is here tonight. Alongside Professor Megan Davis, Aunty Pat oversaw the largest deliberative process with Indigenous people on Australia's Constitution in our nation's history, and I would like to acknowledge Aunty Pat here tonight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no greater challenge than facing up to the climate and biodiversity crises we face. We live in truly unprecedented times. Generations before us faced their own unprecedented times: world wars; famines; pandemics; natural disasters. Many of our forebears put their lives on the line to build what they saw as a brighter future. Many lost their lives doing so. Others gave up their freedoms to build a more equitable society—activists who were at the time vilified, arrested and even killed, many of whom we now hold up as heroes for their lives of service and commitment to building a better future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today the systems that sustain life on earth are at the brink of collapse. The climate as we know it is breaking down, and the impacts are now being felt with distressing regularity. Extreme weather, drought, bushfires, hailstorms and floods are having a devastating effect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also seeing the impacts on the state of the environment. The sixth mass extinction event is underway. The last one 66 million years ago was due to a massive asteroid. This time we're causing it. As farmer and writer Wendell Berry said:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Whether we and our politicians know it or not, Nature is party to all our deals and decisions, and she has more votes, a longer memory, and a sterner sense of justice than we do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's on us to make the changes, and it's not too late.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the midst of this doom and gloom is an invitation to begin to turn things around. Thanks to ancient Indigenous wisdom and the latest in science and technology, we have never known more about these life support systems, what we're doing to them and what can and must be done to halt this catastrophic decline and begin to reverse it. We know what we're doing and we know what we need to do. We are one of the first generations with this knowledge and probably the last to be able to do anything about it. Some of our failure has been a failure of imagination, a failure to imagine how great our future can be. Our future can be great if we actually focus on the things that matter—the long-term health and wellbeing of our families, our communities and our land. This takes courage and leadership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It seems to me that a big part of politics is about dealing with problems in a way that turns them into opportunities. We have an opportunity to begin to write a new story, a better story, a story that is built on accepting responsibility for where we are and finding the courage to change where we are going. This is not about naive thinking or just hoping for the best; it's about a new kind of pragmatism where our actions actually match the scale of the challenges.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I have already thanked many of the people whose efforts and contribution helped bring me to this place I would like to make mention of a few others. There are the many elders whose knowledge and wisdom is recorded in books. I am grateful for my brothers, Mike and Steve, and the lessons we continue to learn together. There is my family, now scattered across the country and across the globe, and there are those like the Trethowans, the Stirzakers, the Saunders, the Ncubes, the Mastersons, the Mututus, the Clarkes and the O'Keefes, who have treated Emma and I like family. To Rick and Tracy Laird, Brian Walker, Nick Abel, George, Robert Bump, Phanuel Ncube, the Rangelands Regeneration team, the Beitbridge farmers and many others: I thank you. And of course, my wife, my friend, Emma: thank you. To my incredible team who worked tirelessly to serve the people of the ACT, whose brilliance and enthusiasm astounds me every single day—Fiona, Sam, Rory, Katia, Lincoln, Tom: thank you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my new colleagues: thank you for your care for our great country. I hope through debate and collaboration we can find ways to deal with these great challenges we face and make a real difference in the lives of those we represent. Not only is it the first time the ACT has had an independent senator; it's the first time we've had someone on the crossbench with the balance of power. I intend to use that power in the best interests of the people of the ACT to achieve practical outcomes, like pushing the Commonwealth to forgive our historic social housing debt. It's been done for Tasmania. It's been done for South Australia. It's time to do it for us. For too long we have been neglected, ridiculed, looked down at or flat-out ignored. Canberra is the nation's capital. I want this to once again be a source of great pride. No longer are we a safe seat. Investment now has to flow into much-needed infrastructure, including community infrastructure. The days of the ACT getting less than a quarter of its fair share of infrastructure funding by head of population are over. We also need more equitable representation, and that's an argument I look forward to prosecuting over my term. We need to continue our legacy of leadership on everything from marriage equality to the smart energy transition, which we so desperately need to accelerate across the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I laughed recently when I read some commentators calling me a kingmaker. It's certainly not a mantle I seek; instead, I'd prefer to try and be a peace broker in the 47th Parliament. The challenges facing us are so important. I want to be part of making sure we don't just end the climate wars but we win them—we win them and we start to lead as a country on climate action and biodiversity conservation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not here to stand in the way. I'm here to offer my perspective as a representative of Canberra, Jervis Bay and Norfolk Island in the hopes that we can make politics about people. For me, part of doing that is making sure this place and the business we do in it better lives the values of the people who we've been sent here to represent. So, finally, I'd like to say thank you to the people of the ACT. Whether you voted for me or not, I'll work on your behalf for the next three years. I'm committed to being accessible and transparent, and I certainly know that you'll hold me to account. Thank you.</span>

There's wisdom and power in this history that this parliament refuses to acknowledge, but I acknowledge it here, and I recognise the long history of First Nations led resistance to violent dispossession and genocide.</span>

And everywhere in between and across this extraordinary land is Aboriginal land. I look around this chamber and I see and respect the growing number of First Nations senators in this place, including my two powerful Greens colleagues, Lidia Thorpe and Dorinda Cox. I acknowledge that, for as much as time means anything to us as humans, this land always was and always will be Aboriginal land.</span>

Yes, we'll push this government further and faster on things that matter—on climate change, on integrity and on fairness. More than that, though, we're here to change the system—to make it represent the many and not just the few. You've told us what you care about, and we hear you. We're ready to make changes. We're ready to legalise cannabis. We're going to tax billionaires to deliver dental and mental health care into Medicare. And we'll fight to keep coal and gas in the ground.</span>

                  </a>  I think that's harsh, President, but I'll take it! Jack saw earlier than most how social and environmental struggles are inextricably linked. I stood with Jack on that last successful green ban he was involved with, to protect the beautiful Bondi Pavilion from destruction, and I learned from Jack. Judy, Jack's partner in life and activism, is here with us today. Working as a young lawyer, I also had the opportunity to act for building workers and the construction union—part of Jack's old union. I saw directly how collective union action was essential to face down the threats to individual workers, to protect conditions and to uphold safety standards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In that work, I had my first taste of real-world politics. I acted for the union in the viciously anti-union Cole royal commission set up by John Howard, and I was also sent in to oppose the then state Labor government's push to strip back workers compensation rights, making it even harder for injured workers to live in dignity. In fact, it was in that political stoush that I first saw Greens in action in parliament. I saw Lee Rhiannon and one of her staff members, John Kaye, listen to the concerns of working people, understand the history and go in to bat for them when no-one else would. That was the early 2000s, and it was also a time of mass movements—mass movements against war, with hundreds of thousands of us marching for peace. As we marched all across this country, this place ignored the calls for peace and, apart from Bob Brown and Kerry Nettle, barely ruffled a feather as Australia went off to another unjust war.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, as a lifelong bushwalker, things were coming together for me: social and environmental justice, peace and political action. I joined the Greens, and look what that has done! In fact, it's remarkable to think that almost 20 years ago to the day, Kerry Nettle delivered her first speech in this parliament as the first-ever Greens senator in New South Wales—thanks, Kerry, for all your work. And today, I enter the Senate as a Greens and one of a record 16 Greens elected in this parliament. And I'm also part—</span>

                  </a>  Thank you. I enter the Senate as a Greens, and one of a record 16 elected Greens in this place. And I'm also part of a growing global Greens movement. That's a movement of solidarity that sees our challenges collectively and realises we all share this one planet, our only planet, and we'd better not stuff it up. So, yes, for all those conspiracy types from the fringe Right: it's all true! We do think and act globally, and then we act locally. It's all true! We're all in on it. We all have plans to replace cars with trains, bikes and ferries; coal-fired power stations with wind farms and batteries; and private with public. And then, when we have you distracted, we're going to sneak up behind you, tax a few billionaires and then socialise medicine by whacking dental and mental into Medicare. It's just that, unlike others, we're conspiring in the open, and it's to save the planet, not to own it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've always found that the more I am among people struggling for change, the more inspired I am to get into places like this and fight for the future. I'm a believer in renewable power, and my batteries are charged when I'm out amongst all of you, hearing your stories, gathering ideas and being directed by people's everyday struggles for decency and justice. I get this when I work with Don Craigie—Uncle Duck—seeking justice for his nephew's death on rail tracks south of Tamworth. I get it working with Grandmothers Against Removals, fighting for First Nations families. I get it when I stand alongside survivors of institutional abuse to demand and then deliver laws that bend towards justice. And I get it when I work alongside the Bowraville families as they take on a racist criminal justice system that discounts the murder of their children. Their struggles should be parliament's struggles and, as Greens, we'll make that happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's when we stand together and we look out for each other that we can really change the world. It's when we see how much we have in common that we don't divide ourselves. We look across the globe; that's when we're strongest. And in our struggle for justice, it's inspiring to work with communities across this country that share our values. It's why I'm honoured to have members of the Kurdish community here, and I'm so thankful for their trust in the Greens and me. It's why I'm so thankful for the support from the Bangladeshi and Pakistani communities, and from all those across the Indian diaspora who are in the gallery and who share our values of tolerance, democracy and peace. Whether it's the struggle for Palestinian justice, or Kashmiri or Kurdish self-determination, we know that human rights need to be seen as global rights and very much the business of this parliament.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this land, First Nations justice must be core to all that we do. Yes, that's heritage and culture but it's also taking action on incarceration, racist laws, economic empowerment and treaty. It means ending forced child removals. It means not locking up kids. It means truth and treaty, and land back. No party can claim to be in favour of reconciliation and First Nations justice while supposing mandatory sentencing laws, expending prisons, racist policing and child removals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've seen this happening firsthand during my work in the New South Wales parliament. Just this year, I've seen New South Wales Labor flip from supporting to opposing a Greens bill that would have prevented racist child removals and empowered First Nations children and communities, and they flipped after a 20-minute talkback radio spray from a right-wing shock jock. In that single backflip, broken politics stole thousands of futures. Those are the politics that keep jailing 10-year-old First Nations kids in Don Dale prison. Those are the politics that strip mine First Nations' land and ship the profits off to Switzerland or London or New York. These politics are deadly in all the wrong ways.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can't solve those problems by listening to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span> or the <span style="font-style:italic;">Herald Sun</span>. We'll solve them by listening to the likes of Aunty Hazel Collins and her daughter, Helen Eason, because it was Aunty Hazel who taught me the truth about First Nations child removals. Hazel taught me how FACS then DOCS then DCJ were taking babies from her country. She told me about First Nations mums in her town who still hide their kids when a white government car drives up. She taught me about the trauma to her family when their babies were stolen. And Helen, her daughter, has taught me about strength and resilience. After years of disrespect and struggle, Helen is now running her own healing centre, doing what the government wouldn't, and she's got her whole family around her. Helen and Hazel and the many other First Nations people I've had the privilege to work alongside have patiently taught me the strength, the power of the oldest continuous culture on this planet, who will never stop fighting for and protecting their families and their country, and that's a lesson this whole country needs.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Governments show us their priorities by who they shower with attention and cash, and who they make wait. And in this country young people, people on Centrelink, people with disability, First Nations peoples, people without a home are all being told to wait. They can wait, while a handful of mining and property billionaires are literally raking it in, and the next budget will see Labor and the coalition joining together to hand out over $200 billion in stage 3 tax cuts to the super wealthy—like they need it!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I see economic justice as essential human rights and justice work, and that means resisting the system that knows the price of everything but the value of nothing, the system that values forests only as woodchips, the system that accepts the state of your teeth as a marker of class, the system that takes homelessness and hunger as just a cost of doing business, the system that overfunds private schools and cheats public education, and the system that's literally devouring our planet and our future just for profit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, it's true that political decisions and loyalty are being bought by donations by big corporates and fossil fuel corporations, but it's also true that the loyalty of the political class in this country is with the billionaires. It's with the billionaires, with the self-importance of parliament, and it's not with the people. So let's change things. Let's see every billionaire as a policy failure, and, instead of firing them off to Mars, let's tax them back to Earth. Let's stop hearing how we can't afford a safe, quality home for everyone, how we can't afford free early childhood education, how we can't afford to lift people out of poverty, how we can't afford action on climate change. We can, we will and we must.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we are to survive and thrive, then we don't have a choice. We need to keep coal and gas in the ground. This isn't a 43 per cent issue or a 75 per cent issue. The science is telling us that for Australia, with its globally significant fossil fuel deposits, it's a 100 per cent issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After the 2019-20 Black Summer fires, I travelled around my beautiful state of New South Wales. I met communities in deep shock, surrounded by ash-white and eerily silent forests. It's the silence that still gets me—just these dead forests stretching on and on. I saw towns sliced down the middle by fire. It was a window into our worst future. More recently, the window has cranked further open, as we've seen severe storms and floodwater inundate Brisbane, repeatedly swamp parts of my home town of Sydney and devastate—literally devastate—towns like Lismore. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This isn't normal. This isn't safe. If we get the politics right, it can be halted, and, over time, it can be reversed. But, if we get the politics wrong, this destruction is just the start. Now, that's one hell of a responsibility on all of us. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that we are in a climate and extinction crisis and that our laws just refuse to acknowledge it. Our laws will put people in jail for graffiti but not for destroying an ecosystem. That's literally cooked. Surely it's time to enact a new criminal offence of ecocide. Ecocide is the mass, widespread damage and destruction of ecosystems in nature. It is—or at least should be—criminal when it's done by corporations or politicians or governments intentionally or recklessly. So, instead of a short-lived Twitter backlash and a revolving door taking you from politics into a six-figure consultancy, if you gladhand a fossil fuel project that screws our collective future, you get 20 years in jail. That sounds more than fair to me. That's the kind of accountability I'd vote for, and I'd backdate it to today. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Saving the planet and delivering on fairness and transparency is surely going to require some serious renovation of this democracy. With the major parties' votes shrinking, a growing chorus of voters have elected Greens, Independents and minor-party MPs to this place. They did that because they want a new style of politics that's focused on them, the people, not on us. From my short observation, over the last few days, of this parliament, it still operates on a model of politics that is performative and combative. It's all about brand differentiation rather than about delivering real change. It doesn't have to be that way. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Talk of traditions and convention is already being used by government ministers as code for preventing us from making this place more real, more accessible and ultimately more useful. Conventions are also being used to maintain the government's domination of the agenda and time in this place, in the Senate, which is bizarre when you realise they only have 26 of 76 members. That's just over a third. It's an equation that makes no sense to me. I am hopeful that sometime, sooner rather than later, these numbers will be used to provide far greater scrutiny, transparency and accountability of the executive. Last time I checked, that's meant to be a core job of the Senate. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my friends and mentors in politics, the first of which is John Kaye—we lost John in 2016. John was smarter, more principled, more hardworking than anyone else I've tried to keep up with. I chased him around the state parliament for about five years. I still miss him. Having John's partner, Lynne Joslyn, with us now holds that link for me. Thanks for coming, Lynne. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge in the gallery three former New South Wales elected Greens: Lee Rhiannon, Sylvia Hale and Michael Organ. Lee, I can't thank you enough for your friendship, kindness, generosity and support. Sylvia taught me about bravery in politics. I took her spot in the New South Wales parliament. I don't think I'll ever top Sylvia, who, a bit over a decade ago, asked the notorious New South Wales property developer Ron Medich in budget estimates if he had any involvement in the brutal murder of his business partner, Michael McGurk. We all wanted the question asked. I remember the united howls of outrage from Medich and from all the other MPs when Sylvia asked it. But Sylvia knew about the New South Wales development industry, and she knew she was right. We now have that answer, and Ron Medich is working his way through a 39-year prison sentence. So I hope I can be as brave as Sylvia and Lee in my work here. I also recognise Michael Organ as the first Greens member to win a seat in the House of Representatives. Michael, it must be lovely to look across this building and see four Greens—thanks to that 'Greenslide'—occupying the benches you first sat on. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to thank the team that ran an extraordinary federal election campaign in New South Wales: James Ryan, Kilty O'Brien, Lucy Small and Aish Cowgill, who worked closely with me on the Senate run, and all the statewide team. I owe special thanks to our amazing 47 lower house candidates. They worked for months on end making direct contact with people, persuading them, one by one, how different politics could be. I owe you all my place in parliament, and I hope to see a bunch of you join us here in three years time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my New South Wales parliamentary friends and colleagues from across the political spectrum, but especially to Abigail Boyd who is here tonight: thank you for your comradeship. To be honest, I have a bit of FOMO as I see my former committee, the Public Accountability Committee, slicing through the latest New South Wales 'parliamentary jobs for mates' scandal. But I also see how the structures we built together in the New South Wales parliament over the last 10 years are working to force accountability on an unwilling government. I can tell you, whatever else it is, New South Wales politics sure is a masterclass in scandal, corruption and abuse of power—lessons that will certainly come in useful here. </span>

Thanks for every tree you've saved and planted, for every park you've protected, for every solar panel you've installed, every meeting you've suffered through and every resident that you helped. As a recovering councillor myself, I see how that work underpins Greens politics, and I thank you for it. </span>

My mum's also in the chamber. Thanks, Mum. It means a lot to me. Dr Tsang, my father-in-law, my daughters' tireless gung gung, is also in the gallery—just as he's been everywhere else when we've needed him—and to Chi, who can't be here but is watching at home with Lester: thank you for your love, support and countless delicious dinners. You both help make our little Sydney family very, very special. </span>

I can't imagine life without you, and I love you all more than fits in any one speech. To my amazingly talented oldest daughter, Jess, who's stuck at Camp Woollahra doing her HSC trials: Jess, I'm sorry about the timing and I promise to make it up to you—and you will smash it. Han, my No. 1 youngest daughter: you are funny, bright, generous and talented. In short, you take after your mum. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Patricia, thank you for being here today and the years of support, love and grounding. I'm sorry there weren't more facts in this speech, but here's one big fact: you, Jess and Han are far more important to me than any of this, and, when I'm working here, absent from you all, it's because of you and it's for you. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HZB" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BILYK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:57</span>):  Before my speech on the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Self-Employment Programs and Other Measures) Bill 2022 was interrupted, I was talking about the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme and how important it was. It was introduced in 1985 by the Hawke government. This initiative is particularly important to mention because it relates directly to the bill we're debating now. Through NEIS, individuals can receive a package of services that helps them to establish a new business. More recently, it has also helped existing business owners impacted by COVID-19 to continue running their businesses or refocus their operations to meet new areas of demand. Since NEIS was introduced, it has helped over 198,000 people. As I was saying, there are a number of supports available through NEIS, including accredited small-business training, help to develop a business plan, personalised mentoring from an NEIS provider and, if you are eligible, NEIS allowance for up to 39 weeks and NEIS rental assistance for up to 26 weeks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">NEIS can potentially be a great option for jobseekers. If someone has a business idea they'd like to try out which is likely to be commercially viable, NEIS provides the flexibility to allow them to put their energy into pursuing that idea without having to apply for jobs in the meantime. After all, when someone is making a genuine effort to secure a regular income then why place restrictions on whether they do it through employment or self-employment? While some people are happy working for someone else, there are others who like the choice, the control and the freedom that comes with self-employment. There are many people who struggle with traditional employment but thrive in an environment where they can be their own boss.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's interesting to note that people with disability, because of the challenges they face in having their skills recognised, are 40 per cent more likely to be self-employed than the rest of the population. Clearly, there is much more work to be done to overcome discrimination against people with disability and to recognise the valuable skills and talents they have. But I am also glad that so many people with disability have had a chance to put their skills to use in a way that also gives them freedom and control.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The success of NEIS is not just in its ability to help people establish their own business; it also helps establish businesses that survive and thrive. Three months after exiting the program, 82 per cent of NEIS participants remained in employment and 68 per cent were still running their business. The fact that NEIS has continued for 37 years through governments of both persuasions is a testament to its success and the esteem in which it is held. The Department of Education, Skills and Employment website features many success stories about how the program has helped people pursue their business ideas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Several other success stories appeared in the booklet celebrating the 30th anniversary of the scheme. One of my favourites, because it is from my home state of Tasmania, is that of Social Circus Tasmania. Christian and Staja Florence established the business in 2012. The idea behind Social Circus Tasmania is to engage individuals, groups, families and communities in circus workshops to build teamwork, trust, determination, concentration and playfulness. A few years ago Social Circus Tasmania had a presence at a big event called 'A Day on the Beach', of which I've been patron for about a decade, although the event is now changing its name to 'A Day at the Park'. While the founders, Christian and Staja, had extensive skills and experience in circus performance, what they gained through NEIS was how to turn that experience and their passion for something they enjoyed doing into a viable business. This is the value of the business management training and business planning assistance that NEIS offers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the many other success stories include: a children's clothing business which, during COVID, pivoted to producing face masks when Melbourne went into lockdown; a former Australian Defence Force member who, through his successful career, had developed a passion for health, fitness and pushing people to their limit and turned it into a personal training business; someone who had a unique knowledge of locations not being visited by tour operators and attracted a market with her new tour company; and a theatre prop maker and scenic artist who applied her skills to a new business manufacturing wooden furniture and toys, including bespoke rocking horses. It's mind-boggling to think of the wealth of amazing stories that the thousands of people who have benefited from NEIS would have to tell.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before the Senate now, the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Self-Employment Programs and Other Measures) Bill 2022 is necessary because of some recent changes to NEIS. These changes came into effect on 1 July 2022. NEIS has been replaced with the Self-Employment Assistance program throughout Australia, with the exception of Norfolk Island, where NEIS will continue to be offered. This bill updates the Social Security Act 1991, the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 and the Family Law Regulations 1984 to make it clear that the social security law, veterans' entitlement law and family law operate in the same way for the new program as they did for NEIS. It also includes some minor technical amendments and clarifications to the social security law following the recent Social Security Legislation Amendment (Streamlined Participation Requirements and Other Measures) Act 2022.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:03</span>):  As servants to the people of Queensland and Australia, One Nation stand for veterans and small business. But I want to address the root cause. This is a bandaid; it's very necessary but it's not addressing the root cause.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Gallagher has stated that self-employment is 'an excellent alternative to traditional employment for Australians who want to use their existing skills and experience in a work environment of their choice'. We agree. Yet Labor is really anti-self-employment and soon intends to stifle small business and self-employed Australians under gig laws that could strangle the sector. They devastated California, for example, and sent people interstate. There's nowhere to go beyond the shores of this country if Labor gets its way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember what Labor, the union bosses and some dishonest, disrespectful, antihuman multinational corporations did in the Hunter Valley. Labor joined them in enabling the exploitation and abuse of casual coalminers in the Hunter, and when I tried to stand up for them the Labor member of parliament for the Hunter at the time, Mr Joel Fitzgibbon, misrepresented me and the problems, apparently to hide the problems. That perpetuated the abuse of workers and the hurting of workers. Labor does not care about workers. Modern Labor cares about getting Green votes in the inner cities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyday Australians are now suffering from 2½ years of COVID mismanagement, and it is ongoing. Labor wasn't the federal government during that time, but Labor was in power in the states, and the states and the federal government worked together, hand in hand, to destroy the productive capacity of this country, not only over the last 2½ years but over the last 78 years, since 1944. Labor wants to phase out the coal industry and jobs in the coal sector and related sectors. The Labor-Greens coalition in the Senate is hell-bent on doing that. Labor is in favour of eroding our rights and freedoms and increasing rents, house prices, energy prices and debt. There is a lack of much-needed tax reform and economic reform. That needs to be comprehensive reform. As I said a minute ago, Australia's productive capacity is being destroyed and has been in the process of being destroyed for 78 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In uncertain times, such as I've just described, much, much more needs to be done to support small business and the self-employed. Yes, we agree that starting a new enterprise or a self-employment assistance program is a help to some people, particularly hardworking veterans who have earned the support, but they're up against it in the form of the taxation system, energy prices, lack of infrastructure and capricious overregulation. All workers—not just veterans—are suffering because the productive capacity of our beautiful country has been destroyed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The economic environment has been destroyed. The government's job is not to employ people. The government's job is to create an environment that favours employment through people taking risks with investment and hiring workers. That's where real jobs—sustainable jobs—come from. That's known throughout civilisation. We must give Australians the opportunity to be free, to be their own boss and to own a business that offers them secure work and financial independence. They should be free to create, initiate and innovate, and that requires cheap energy. Labor, with its mates in the Labor-Greens coalition, are raising energy prices. We went from having the cheapest electricity sources in the world to having amongst the highest electricity prices in the world. It's not due to resources and it's not due to Mother Nature; it's due entirely to mismanagement under the Liberal-Labor-Nats-Greens circus.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only do we need affordable, reliable and secure energy but also we need fair reward. That means we need a comprehensive reform of the tax system. Why are we letting multinational corporations off the hook, as we did with Robert Menzies's bill in 1953 and Prime Minister Hawke's legislation on the petroleum rent resource tax in the 1980s? Both sides have done it. Jim Killaly, the former deputy assistant commissioner of taxation in this country, who was responsible for large companies and international matters, said—and he said it in 1996 and in 2010—that 90 per cent of Australia's large companies are foreign owned and, since 1953, have paid little or no company tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, individuals in this country are paying exorbitant tax rates. The median income in this country now is $51,000. After tax, that's around $45,000 or $46,000. The additional cost of Labor, Greens, Nationals and Liberals policy on energy—the additional cost of solar and wind subsidies and climate subsidies—is a staggering $1,300 per year. How the hell can someone earning $45,000 or $46,000 a year afford that additional cost? That's not the cost of electricity; that's an additional cost for solar and wind subsidies. We're sending the country broke because of the people in this building lacking the courage to do what is right and tell the truth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Veterans need more support, and this bill is just not enough. When will Labor and the Greens do something about housing, rent, veteran suicide, agriculture, energy and inflation? Who will protect the economy and jobs? Who will create the economic environment that will enable people to invest, innovate, create and to be entrepreneurs? Who will do that? When will Labor and the Greens do something about this very issue? Who will restore the productive capacity of our country, the economic environment of our country? Labor and the Greens don't understand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, while I enjoyed listening to Senator Allman-Payne yesterday, sharing her emotions freely, she was crying at the plight of the poor and then congratulating Senator Larissa Waters for her 12 years in the Senate when Senator Waters is directly responsible for raising the cost of electricity which is destroying the poor and raising prices through the roof in terms of inflation. That's what's going on: it's complete ignorance. Contrary to that, we understand. One Nation understand the root causes and the solutions to the root causes of these problems. We are one people, we are one community and we are one magnificent country with enormous potential. We just need to become, again, one nation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="122087" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McCARTHY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Indigenous Australians and Assistant Minister for Indigenous Health</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:11</span>):  The Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Self-Employment Programs and Other Measures) Bill 2022 seeks to amend social security law and related elements of veterans and family laws. This is to make clear the law operates in the same way when participants access self-employment services through the Self-Employment Assistance program as through the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme. They're subtle but important changes to ensure services are streamlined and support is available to people engaged in self-employment and small businesses across Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can all appreciate the importance of small business to the Australian economy, communities and families. There are around 2.4 million small businesses actively trading and employing around 4.7 million people. Self-employed people take many familiar forms. They could be a writer, a photographer, a hairdresser, an accountant, a landscaper or a lawyer. Self-employment is an alternative to traditional employment and offers Australians the opportunity to use their skills to succeed. It gives Australians freedom to use their existing experience and skills to work in an environment of their choice. Our government recognises the importance of this choice and the support needed to foster that choice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Self-employment also helps Australians who struggle to apply their skills in other labour market settings, to use those skills and succeed in their area of employment. That's why people, especially those with a disability, who still face significant challenges in having their skills recognised by employers, are more likely to be self-employed than the general population in Australia. Whether it's an Indigenous artist based in the Northern Territory or a cafe owner in Sydney, self-employment provides an invaluable opportunity for Australians to pursue their passion and find meaningful work that is valuable to themselves, their family, their community and the Australian economy. It's really why this bill is so important. It will give self-employed Australians confidence that there is clear and consistent treatment of income tested support within the relevant legislative frameworks. The significance of this support cannot be understated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party has a strong history of supporting new small businesses and self-employment. It was the Hawke government that launched the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme, or NEIS program, in 1985 to help unemployed Australians create their own employment opportunities. Since then, NEIS has successfully helped around 200,000 Australians to start and run their small businesses. The program provided small business training and 12 months of personalised mentoring to support Australians to start viable small businesses. The Self-Employment Assistance program today builds on the success of NEIS and its legacy through additional and more tailored services that allow participants to choose what support they need for their small business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments will help make sure the same support made available under NEIS will continue to support people in the Self-Employment Assistance program today. Both Self-Employment Assistance and the Entrepreneurship Facilitators program give participants the tools that they need to create their own business and earn an income to achieve financial independence, with fewer traditional jobs available and an increased number of job-ready seekers on the employment services case load. Self-Employment Assistance offers flexible services to help people who are interested in becoming self-employed and people who are existing microbusiness owners, and it's delivered by small-business specialist providers in 51 employment regions across Australia. The involvement of self-employment support and associated reforms has become farther ranging and more inclusive since the beginnings of the NEIS almost 40 years ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2012, concurrency for disability employment services participants was introduced to the program. This allowed disability employment services participants to continue to have access to specialised disability support while also accessing specialised small-business support from the NEIS provider. <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia's disability strategy 2021-2031</span> recognises the crucial role of self-employment and business ownership in increasing employment opportunities for people living with a disability. Self-employment creates opportunity amidst the labour market disadvantages faced by people living with a disability. In fact, individuals with a disability already had a higher relative rate of business ownership than those without a disability. <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia's disability entrepreneurial ecosystem: experiences of people with disability with microenterprises, self-employment and entrepreneurship</span>, a joint report from the University of Technology Sydney, National Disability Services, Settlement Services International, and Break-Thru People Solutions, published in 2020, found that people with a disability were 40 per cent more likely to be self-employed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2016, the Highly Disadvantaged Trial was also introduced to provide additional support for more Australians engaged in self-employment. This trial targeted a range of disadvantaged cohorts such as migrants, people with a disability and those from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. In 2018, the Highly Disadvantaged Trial was amended to focus on assisting migrants and refugees, and NEIS providers could access these places on an as-needed basis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2019, Entrepreneurship Facilitators expanded to 23 regions across Australia, broadening eligibility to anyone wishing to start their own business. A year later, eligibility to access NEIS was also amended to support part-time businesses to assist those with caring responsibilities or working part time with accessing support to create their own income through self-employment. It also supported existing microbusinesses impacted by COVID-19 with accessing support to pivot their businesses to remain viable. In July last year, veterans transitioning out of the Australian Defence Forces, and their adult family members, were able to access workshops and commence NEIS training while still in the ADF to explore self-employment while still employed. Strong demand for support emerged during COVID-19, when there were fewer traditional jobs available and many jobseekers sought to create their own job by starting a small business. NEIS, or New Business Assistance with NEIS, ended on 30 June this year, replaced with the new Self-Employment Assistance program, which supports more tailored servicing and participants choosing which services they need to access to support their self-employment journey.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to share some of the personal stories of this program. Participants value the space the self-employment program creates to focus on developing their ideas, learning critical foundational skills like bookkeeping, and connecting with mentors. The program also creates a safety net for those just starting out, allowing them to start earning income from their new business while NEIS allowances are paid. Participants can also receive income from outside the business, such as from investments or other work, while receiving assistance. Successful NEIS alumni include singers, comedians, web designers, music venue developers and artisan ice-cream makers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to bring to the Senate a fantastic story from the Northern Territory. It's one of almost 200,000 coming from the NEIS, which really humanises the importance of good policy in small-business support. In 2012, Holly Copping opened the doors to the Territory Laser Clinic. Established while participating in the NEIS program, the Territory Laser Clinic offers a range of treatments, including those related to acne, acne scarring and tattoo removal. Having experienced acne from the age of 12, Holly wanted to ensure no-one struggled with the same issues that she did, and she became the Northern Territory's first qualified dermal therapist. Holly enjoyed using her knowledge and expertise to change people's lives. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While participating in NEIS, Holly was nominated for two regional awards and was awarded the National NEIS Association's award Best New Business in 2013. She became the first Northern Territory business to win the award. Holly was presented with the award by the Deputy Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, which was a very special moment for her. I want to put into <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> Holly's quotes, when she reflected on how far that program had taken her and where it actually took her. Holly said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I can honestly say that the NEIS programme is 100 per cent worth the effort. The advice and coaching I received was invaluable. Monthly mentoring and quarterly visits ensured that I monitored the growth of my business, and the financial support was amazing to say the least. I can highly recommend this programme to anyone who has a new business idea.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was Holly Copping when she received her award. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's, really, individual stories like this that show us the real impact that business support has on people's lives, particularly when it comes to self-employment and fostering small business. Small businesses are the backbone of many communities across Australia. Small business and those with fewer than 20 employees comprise around 98 per cent of all business operating in the Australian economy. And, as I said previously, they employ around 4.7 million people or around 41 per cent of the business workforce. Small business is diverse, operating in every industry and region, attracting a range of different owners and employees, and can be highly agile and adept at responding to areas of the economy that are experiencing growth. Small business is continuously entering and exiting the Australian economy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As at 30 June 2021 there were around 2.4 million actively trading businesses in the Australian economy. Within this landscape, around 360,000 new businesses entered the economy and around 270,000 businesses exited. Small businesses are particularly significant employers in the agriculture, forestry and fishing, rental, hiring and real estate, construction and professional, scientific and technical services sectors. So, while the industry mix changes over time, the most common sectors for new NEIS businesses are hospitality, retail trade, transport and logistics, and professional services. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Self-employment programs, such as Self-Employment Assistance and the Entrepreneurship Facilitator, have a role in helping people create new small businesses and ensuring people who start in these businesses have the ability and knowledge to survive, thrive and grow. There was a significant increase in self-employment seen through COVID due to the lack of traditional jobs available, which is perhaps another demonstration of the importance of flexibility in self-employment and associated programs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There will be $843 million available over five years, from 2021-22, for self-employment services, and this is an absolutely critical investment. Self-Employment Assistance overall is a more flexible and tailored program and allows participants to access the service components in any order, based on their individual needs. Self-Employment Assistance providers have a greater role in promoting self-employment opportunities as well as promoting the program in their local regions to the broader community as well as key stakeholders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These important changes streamline the delivery of services, increase referrals to self-employment and reduce duplication. The bill, as part of schedule 1, will also ensure that, if Self-Employment Assistance is given a different name, the family, social security and veterans' entitlement laws will continue to operate in the same way. Whether you are a veteran, a young person, a refugee or a single mother with caring duties, it's important that we as parliamentarians extend our support to self-employed Australians who need it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="281603" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator MARIELLE SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:25</span>):  I rise today also to make a contribution on the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Self-Employment Programs and Other Measures) Bill. This bill provides clarity around two self-employment programs that support Australians to start and run small businesses. The first is the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme, or NEIS, that was established in 1985 under a Labor government, and which has successfully assisted 198,000 people in starting their own business since its commencement. An incredible achievement! The second is the Self-Employment Assistance program, which largely expanded upon and replaced the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme when it commenced on 1 July 2022. This bill clarifies that the law operates in the same way for Self-Employment Assistance as it now operates for the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill makes amendments not only to social security law but also to related elements of two additional important laws: veterans and family law. The bill will update these laws to make clear that Self-Employment Assistance payments will be treated in the same way by the law as the previous New Enterprise Incentive Scheme payments. The bill adds an additional definition of 'self-employment program' and allows for a change in the name of Self-Employment Assistance by the employment secretary to ensure the same laws will apply if the assistance is renamed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, the bill makes a small number of minor technical amendments. This bill is an administrative amendment to provide clarification to participants using two incredibly valuable self-employment programs. These two programs are designed with the intention to provide assistance to Australians wanting to create new small businesses. As I mentioned previously, the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme was launched under the Hawke government and has helped nearly 200,000 people since it commenced 37 years ago. It's a program designed to help people move off income support by starting their own business and generating their own income—people who are otherwise, perhaps, relying on social security or veterans entitlements payments and, for the past 2½ years, the COVID payment. This is a program with proven effectiveness. It was found that, three months after exiting the program, 82 per cent of participants remained in employment and 68 per cent were still running their business. That is an excellent outcome for the individuals whose real lives this program has impacted and the real businesses and opportunities that they've created. On top of that, more than half of the participants who accessed the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme over the past seven years were women. It's a fantastic opportunity for women to earn their own incomes, support their families and contribute economically to their communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Self-Employment Assistance program commenced on 1 July 2022, and we know it builds upon the existing services of the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme. The Self-Employment Assistance program provides further flexibility and more tailored services to allow participants to access the support that best suits their circumstance. This includes accredited training to prepare a comprehensive business plan, advice sessions and business health checks. These services will help people to generate and validate business ideas and assist them in making informed decisions about the efficacy of their business plan. The Self-Employment Assistance program will continue the self-employment allowance that was established under the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme. This allowance from the government helps supplement the income a participant earns from their business to provide them with the ability to reinvest their business earnings back into that business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Deputy President, in our home state of South Australia, programs that aid the employment sector are especially welcomed, and I know you would welcome them too. Although we have seen an improvement in the unemployment rate nationally, we know that, in my state of South Australia, the unemployment rate tends to be behind the national average. Indeed, the ABS June report showed that South Australia's unemployment rate was 4.3 per cent, compared to 3.5 per cent nationally. South Australia is now tied with Tasmania as having the highest unemployment rate in Australia. Of course, these aren't just statistics; they're real people. When we lag behind the national employment rate, it has a real impact on people in my state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I said in my first speech in this place that securing jobs in my state requires governments to stand up and fight for them. We can never be complacent about the need to create effective policies that address the ongoing risks to job security in South Australia. To deliver good jobs in South Australia, we need to actively forge a good economy and to forge opportunities for work and business that grow jobs. In South Australia, we know that a strong and resilient economy does not build itself. It has always required a degree of support and assistance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm really proud of the work that successive Labor governments have done to grow business, to grow opportunity and to grow jobs in our state. That work, now under a state and federal Labor government, will only continue. These two governments are genuinely concerned with jobs—fighting for those jobs and building the conditions to make sure more jobs come to South Australia. They're two governments that understand that that must happen in partnership. We need businesses and workers to succeed side by side to create these fantastic opportunities for small business—to give people the opportunity to enter that sector, to create a business and, potentially, to become an employer, with all the opportunities that participation in work brings—and to further grow and strengthen our economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The New Enterprise Incentive Scheme and Self-Employment Assistance program provide South Australians with an alternative to traditional work, and we know it's having a big impact on many South Australians who have been able to access it. I want to share a story about a South Australian named Chloe Gardner. Ms Gardner is an award-winning filmmaker who has also worked as an actress and in management across many companies. Ms Gardner did not have much business knowledge, but, through the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme, she was able to bring her ideas together and gain the knowledge required to start a business, including knowledge in financial management, legal matters and marketing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This assistance and knowledge gained from her time in the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme facilitated the creation of her award-winning business, Kids Camera Action. In 2018, this business was selected as a world-class organisation to present workshops in the United Arab Emirates. This business has enabled thousands of children across South Australia to learn new skills and refine existing strengths in the art of filmmaking. What an incredible contribution to these kids in South Australia and the community as a whole! These stories are inspiring and empowering. I wish we could hear more of them, especially given how tough South Australians—particularly young South Australians—have been doing it these past years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, young South Australians have suffered tremendously over the last decade. Of course, we've had the COVID pandemic, which we're still living in and dealing with. But, through its most difficult phases, those young people were left behind in my state by a government that didn't give their voices the prominence they deserved. Let's be clear: young people bear the brunt of government failures more than any other group in society. They've suffered through two years of insecure employment, cuts to education, and government policy that pushed them to raid their small balances of super. Will they ever recover from that raid? This was a government that pushed the consequences of its choices and actions onto the younger generation—a generation that was denied a proper and loud voice at the heart of government. This is something that the Labor government will address.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the work of our Minister for Youth and what she intends to bring forward to make sure that young people's voices are well and truly heard within the Albanese Labor government. When we think about the trillion dollars of debt inherited by those opposite, the burden of that falls disproportionately on young people. We know that. It's those young people who will feel the after-effects of government failure for years to come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to stand in this chamber today and speak on this bill and the additional positive policies and plans of the Albanese government that will help young Australians. That's really what it's all about: the opportunities to create jobs and opportunities for young people. That is what Labor is all about. We've got policies that will bring back secure employment and make our education system more accessible. I stood in this chamber when those opposite made significant cuts to the university sector which made it harder and more expensive for many young Australians to go to university. It was unacceptable. We want our education system to be more accessible and not less. We want job security front and centre. We'll make it an object of the Fair Work Act and ensure the Fair Work Commission considers it. We've got a range of policies to support casual workers—workers employed directly through companies and also through labour hire measures—that would bring security to workers in Australia and bring back confidence in the workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the previous government's TAFE and education cuts meant a loss in skills and training across Australia—another thing that we are working to fix. The Self-Employment Assistance program described in this bill provides the training required for those wanting to start a small business, but this is not everything, of course. We need to get that investment into TAFE and into training. That's why we're providing 465,000 fee-free TAFE places to train Australians in jobs currently experiencing skills shortages—jobs like engineering, nursing, tech and teaching. We'll deliver up to 20,000 extra uni places over 2022 and 2023, making it easier to get a spot at uni. For young people who want to go to uni and who want that opportunity, ultimately, that's their ticket to a chance at a job in their chosen field. All of these measures combine with the programs explained in this bill and all the things in our agenda to make our economy fairer, to create jobs and to grow opportunities for young people. These are things to celebrate. These are part of our agenda as the Albanese Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think there is certainly plenty of work we need to do to make sure that young South Australians—indeed, all South Australians who want to enter the workforce—have an opportunity to access good jobs and create their own businesses. For young people, we need to support their choices, whether it's to go to university or to do a trade or an apprenticeship. Whatever it may be that enables our young people to fulfil their dreams and aspirations and hopes, that's something worthy of our government's support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For all South Australians who want to work, who appreciate and understand the dignity of work and what those opportunities mean for families, I know so many South Australians value that and value that it is something in our state which is not ever to be taken for granted. Our opportunities, our employment prospects and jobs in my state of South Australia, are things that governments actually have to fight for, so I acknowledge the work of our state Labor government and our federal Labor government. These are really, really important things. I thank the Senate for the opportunity to talk on the bill, and I commend it to the Senate.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="140651" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'NEILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:37</span>):  I rise with some degree of pleasure to speak on this bill, another initiative coming from the newly elected Albanese government, who are firmly focused on enabling Australians, bringing jobs into being and making sure that people who need support in establishing their own work through their small businesses get the assistance that they need. This bill, the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Self-Employment Programs and Other Measures) Bill 2022, makes small but nonetheless crucial amendments to replace the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme with the Self-Employment Assistance program throughout most of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think we can underplay the importance of how things are named. I know in the previous parliament I was very distressed that some of the bills, whose titles were determined by the then government, didn't actually say what they did. Australians understand what it is to become self-employed, with all the joys, the opportunities and the excitement but also with all the debt, the worries and the concerns. They know what self-employment is, and that is what this bill is about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill clarifies that social security law, veterans entitlement law and family law operate in the same way for a new program, Self-Employment Assistance, as for the NEIS, and it also makes a few other minor amendments and clarifications to the current social security law. Self-employment assistance is vital to help those who want to launch their own business and those who have launched their own business and, through that experience, have come to a point of figuring out that they actually need to have a few of their particular questions answered. It can be one thing to be inspired to create your own business, find out a little bit on the internet and get started, but there will be headwinds, and this program recognises that and is here to support people so that they can get the assistance that they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly it has had some impact of a positive kind on the futures of those who have started businesses in recent years. The NEIS figures show that it has helped nearly 200,000 Australians be their own bosses and put into reality their dreams of independence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been, for far too long, an argument and an unquestioned—in some parts of the Australian community—sense that small business is represented by one party in this place. Well, that is absolutely not the case. I know, from talking to colleagues around the chamber and certainly amongst my colleagues in the Labor Party, that very many of us either grew up in family businesses, small businesses, or ran them ourselves. I see Senator McAllister here, and I know that she grew up in the Northern Rivers part of New South Wales, and, seriously, without small businesses that were functioning and operating there, people would be profoundly disadvantaged in terms of employment. Great employers create jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is: not everybody wants to be an employer; not everybody wants to set up their own business; not everybody has the health, the wellbeing, the disposition, the opportunity or the capital to undertake the risk of small business. Not everybody is willing to sell their house—as my father did. I cannot believe he convinced my mother to do this. Having struggled to get a house, five years after they arrived they got one, at Blacktown: 17 Curran Street; a fibro double-fronter; no furniture. They'd got a house five years after they arrived in the country. And my father convinced my mother to sell that house so that he could buy a machine, a front-end loader/backhoe, so that he could commence his own business. Not everybody has that dream and that vision, and not everybody is willing to take on the joys and the risks. But, coming from a small-business family, I know how important it can be to get the right advice and the right assistance, when the time is right for that for you and for your business.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Self-Employment Assistance is a fantastic program that helps jobseekers to create their own business, to earn an income, to achieve financial independence. Sometimes this is born of necessity, if you can't find a job in the area that you live in and you start to figure out: 'Actually, there are a whole lot of lawns that haven't been mowed in my street. Perhaps I might go down to Mrs Jones. I'll begin to do that.' Well, there are a whole lot of questions that follow on from that: 'What are the health and safety obligations? What do I need to do to establish this? Have I got enough money for the plant and equipment? What are the protections?' People have questions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This program provides flexible services to people who are interested in becoming self-employed and people who are in existing microbusinesses. The program itself is delivered by business owners and by small-business specialists. It is provided through 51 employment regions across Australia. So, if you or someone you know and love is at the point where you or they need some assistance with a small business or microbusiness, or if you have plans to start your own business, know that, right across the country, there is this program there, ready to assist you. And, when businesses succeed and they grow, they generate jobs. And that is a fine thing to do—to create work for one of our fellow Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The services that are provided across these 51 employment regions in Australia include 'exploring self-employment' workshops and involve five sessions that are delivered over a period of one to three weeks, providing participants with all the information that they may need about self-employment and what they need to really know to start and run a business. I'm sure that some who have already started will go in there and think, 'Oh, my goodness, I could have made my life so much easier if I'd got a bit of information!' And there would be others who would be going in with more detailed questions because they have started and they want to know how they can improve what they're doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Small business training will provide participants with the foundation skills they need to start and run a small business, and they can access accredited training and choose to do a shorter skill set or a longer cert III or IV in entrepreneurship and new business. Having been a teacher in my life prior to coming to parliament, it's amazing when young people who really were not interested in what school had to offer find their passion; they're interested in finding out what they need to do to bring their passion to life, to monetise it and be able to live their best life, employing themselves in doing what they want to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Returning to study for people who might not have enjoyed school is something that's happening through this program, and it's vital that we have access to training programs. That's why Labor's support of fee-free TAFE places is critical to the growth of jobs in this country—to liberate the capacity and talent of the nation by giving people the opportunity to take what they know and to build on it through further training without incurring an enormous debt, which can be the thing that stops them from following their dreams.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other supports that are offered through this program include business plan development. That supports people to prepare a viable business plan to help their business succeed, helping them identify strategies for success and to forecast the cash flow for their business. Business advice sessions are also available, offering targeted advice relating to a participant's business idea or to existing microbusiness owners, with sessions offered over the course of an hour. Sometimes it is just a chat with a mentor that can really unplug some particularly sticky situations for small businesses. There are also business health checks for existing microbusiness owners, where a participant works with a provider to find ways to improve the viability of the business. They can be delivered in one-on-one sessions over three hours. Small business coaching is also available, and that offers 12 months of personalised mentoring and support to help participants start, develop and run a successful business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The participants who are accepted into the small business coaching element of the program can also receive financial support to purchase up to $300 worth of business costs, such as business insurance. As I said earlier, I am still amazed that my father was able to convince my mother to risk capital from our house to commence a business, and go out and start digging trenches and building roads. As somebody who grew up in that environment, practising answering the phone for the business from age seven, it's a knowledge and skill set that many of us learned at the kitchen table and learned through our immersion in family businesses. But for many Australians that's a commencement of learning that needs to be further developed, outside the kitchen table and with other people who have mentoring capacities and the visual and technical skills to help people understand the full potential of their business. The programs that I'm describing here really provide a level playing field and provide some security and support to make sure that these businesses are set up in a way that is compliant with Australian law and gives the best chance of success. I know that any aspiring small business owner needs the right skills and tools to realise their dreams, and this program is designed to that end.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Small businesses everywhere are the engine room of growth for the Australian economy, but they are particularly vital in the regions of Australia like the Central Coast—my home. It's only a couple of hours north of Sydney but a different world entirely, where public transport doesn't exist and small businesses are the driver of our local economy. I'm also the duty senator for pretty well most of the western part of New South Wales, for the seats of Calare, Parkes, Farrer, Hume and Riverina, and also for the seat of Lyne. All of these are seats where incredible business is done and incredible wealth for the country is generated. They are replete with people commencing their own journey in small business. We need to help nurture more and more of these small businesses to keep growing our economy. They are often sites where innovation occurs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Small businesses form 98 per cent of all existing businesses and employ 41 per cent of Australia's workforce. That's an astounding number of Australians who are engaged in small business, either as the director of the business or as an employee. So 4.7 million of us are involved in small business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For many people, small business is their pathway to the middle class, to enable them to fulfil their aspirations. It's not surprising that in the story I tell about my parents—I'll add a little bit to it! They were immigrants, first arriving here at the end of 1960, putting their shoulder to the wheel in an economy that was growing at the time, and they really worked hard to get themselves a far better life than they had left behind in England, where they met, and in Ireland, where they had been born. It's so important that we provide all Australians with free education programs that allow them to access the opportunities they need to fully contribute to Australia and our success as a nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The results of the program are there for all to see. There have been 198,000 people helped by the program, including 47,259 who have started a new business since July 2015. I'm pleased to say 25,249 of those entrepreneurs were women—that's 53 per cent—and 18,791 were mature-age people aged 45 years and over. The program itself also plays a vital role in helping Australians with a disability become self-employed. Disabled Australians actually have a higher rate of relative business ownership than non-disabled Australians, at 11.6 per cent compared to only 8.2 per cent of the general public. Australia's Disability Strategy 2021-23 actively seeks to increase that already substantial number.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If there was more time I would tell you about two fantastic participants in this program—MAZ3D epoxy floor coatings in Ryde, and Just Enough Beach hand-poured candles on the New South Wales North Coast in Yamba. They're just a couple of the thousands and thousands of companies that have benefited from taking their business and themselves through this program, through mentoring, to improve the capacity of their business. And with success come more and more jobs. These are stories we should celebrating, and, more and more, the revamp of this program will provide those opportunities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our economy will get back on track through the hard work and initiative of people like those business owners who have already benefited. Labor certainly believes in giving entrepreneurial Australians the toolkit they need to start their own business, be their own boss and grow the jobs for future Australians.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="252157" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WALSH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:53</span>):  I too rise to speak on the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Self-Employment Programs and Other Measures) Bill 2022. This bill seeks to update the Social Security Act 1991, the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 and the Family Law Regulations 1984 to provide clarity and consistency in our laws regarding the new Self-Employment Assistance program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Self-Employment Assistance program, which started on 1 July this year, replaced the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme. Labor is very proud of its history with this program. Labor recognises that small businesses are a vital part of our economy. We know that there are over 2.4 million small businesses actively trading in Australia today and that they employ almost five million workers. The development of small business is also an alternative to traditional employment for so many Australians that can provide secure work and financial independence if people are supported with programs like this, while also supporting Australians to use their skills that might not otherwise be recognised by traditional employers to still succeed. That is part of the role of small business as an alternative to traditional employment for many people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Successive Labor governments have supported and encouraged the development of small business in Australia, and the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme is just one example of that. The scheme was introduced by the Hawke Labor government way back in 1985 to help unemployed Australians create their own employment opportunities, and it's been running for 37 years. Over the course of those 37 years this scheme has helped almost 200,000 Australians to start and run their very own small business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before this scheme's creation, before it came into effect, when someone started a small business they would cease to be eligible to access income support, and that acted as a barrier to those who otherwise would have sought to take on a small business venture and create their own employment opportunities. So, to incentivise those who were unemployed to create a small business, the Hawke government launched a trial of the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme, offering participants an allowance in line with their income support entitlement; providing small-business training, with courses designed for participants to learn foundational business skills and develop business plans; and, as well, providing 12 months of personalised mentoring to support those participants to create their very own viable business. Later, in 2012, this scheme was expanded to include participants of disability employment services. It supported Australians with a disability to develop a small business, giving them the flexibility and financial independence of self-employment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The educational and mentoring support included in this scheme has also been extended to those not on income support to encourage more Australians to start viable small businesses. In the last few years eligibility for the scheme has also been expanded to veterans transitioning out of the Australian Defence Force, giving them access to training while they are still employed. It has also been expanded to support part-time businesses, assisting those with part-time employment or, for example, caring responsibilities. These really important expansions have increased participation in the New Enterprise Investment Scheme. In fact, it's women who have made up 53 per cent of participants in the scheme over the past several years, and people with a disability make up almost 20 per cent. Great outcomes have been delivered for these participants, and we can see that in some of statistics on the success of the program. Eighty-two per cent of participants remain in employment three months after they exit the program, and almost 70 per cent are still running their businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Strong demand for this program emerged during COVID, when fewer traditional jobs were available and many jobseekers were looking to self-employment through starting a small business as the way forward during very difficult times. The scheme also helped many businesses pivot to deliver services in new and innovative ways to remain viable, really demonstrating the key role that government can play in helping businesses adapt in uncertain times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 1 July this year the scheme I've been describing was replaced with the new Self-Employment Assistance program. This new program builds on the success of that Hawke government legacy dating back 37 years to 1985. With a budget of over $840 million over five years, the program will continue to support Australians to start and run small businesses, which will create jobs, grow our economy and improve labour market outcomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The new program allows eligible people interested in self-employment to receive free help to generate and validate business ideas, allowing them to make really well-informed decisions about whether self-employment is actually a good fit for them and, potentially, for their families. The expanded program will provide additional services that will be tailored to participants, allowing them to choose the supports that they need—the supports that really suit them in the small business that they would like to set up. These are supports such as free accredited training, business plan development, business advice sessions and business health checks. And business mentoring and advice will be available for eligible business owners who have only recently started trading or who need assistance to adapt their business and their business model in our changing economic environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Self-Employment Assistance program retains the successful components of the New Enterprise Investment Scheme while introducing changes to small business and entrepreneurship services to make them more flexible, and improving access for jobseekers and microbusiness owners. This bill will ensure that the same supports available under the former scheme will continue to support participants of the Self-Employment Assistance program, making clear in our laws that the previous provisions for payments apply equally to the payments under the Self-Employment Assistance program. That's very important to providing clarity for participants while they support themselves to establish their new businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We recognise that this program has supported Australians to gain flexibility and financial security through self-employment, and we recognise that self-employment is a viable pathway for Australians to move off income support, earn their own income and contribute to their communities. But of course we also know that starting a small business takes a lot of time and requires a lot of support, particularly financial support. Labor is committed to supporting and fostering self-employment opportunities for small businesses for people who want to start their own small business. We understand how critical small businesses are to our economy. I must say that it was a pleasure to follow Senator O'Neill in my comments; she has been such a champion for small business in this country. I echo the comments that Senator O'Neill made, and the passion that she demonstrated for our government to show support to people to really pursue their dreams in setting up their own small business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like Senator O'Neill, Labor is committed across the board to supporting and fostering people's small-business opportunities. We know that small business is critical—across the economy but also in particular to local communities, and, as Senator O'Neill said as well, particularly in regional communities. They make up 98 per cent of all businesses in our country and employ around 41 per cent of the business workforce. Small businesses are in every part of the country, in every industry and in every region around Australia. So often small business is the real backbone of local communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The New Enterprise Investment Scheme is a legacy of the Hawke Labor government, and it is really such a strong sign of the work that this parliament can do when we work together in a bipartisan fashion to support good programs. We have a legacy here with this program; it has lasted for over 37 years and through 14 parliaments. That's the sort of change that Labor governments can deliver for Australians and that Labor governments will continue to deliver for Australians: lasting change, change that helps people not only to keep their heads above water and to survive but actually to thrive—to thrive in their businesses and in their communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a program that we're so proud of because it supports people to upskill and re-skill, and it gives them the tools to be successful. It supports Australians to find secure work, whether that's in a traditional employment setting or whether it's through self-employment. Our government will maximise small-business participation in Commonwealth procurement, and use our purchasing power to also support small business through those procurement measures. We believe in delivering better value for money, growing our local economy and providing greater opportunities for business to create more, better and more secure Australian jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government will help address skills shortages that are affecting small businesses, through fee-free TAFE and our cheaper-childcare policy. We're committed to removing barriers to getting people into the workforce, as well as barriers to those who want to return to work. The Albanese government is delivering a better deal for small business by listening to people's needs, reviving genuine collaboration between small business and government, and drawing on Labor's history of working with unions, workers and industry to deliver better outcomes for all.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAROL BROWN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Transport</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:05</span>):  I rise to speak on the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Self-Employment Programs and Other Measures) Bill 2022. Small businesses in Australia have taken a battering over the last two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, and none more so than those who are just starting out. That's why it's more important than ever for government to support and encourage the development of new small businesses and to help viable businesses adapt to change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Small businesses are a vital part of the Australian economy, with 2.4 million small businesses actively trading and employing around 4.7 million people. In Tasmania, the state I represent, 97 per cent of businesses are small businesses, and there are just under 40,000 small businesses employing around 100,000 people. That figure really hits home when you consider that there are around 263,700 employed people in the whole state—so nearly 40 per cent of working Tasmanians are employed in a small business. Almost a quarter of all Tasmanian small-business operators are born overseas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor knows that giving Australians the opportunity to be their own boss and own a business that offers them secure work and financial independence is absolutely vital. For many Australians, self-employment is a great alternative to traditional employment, allowing them to use their existing skills and experience in a work environment they get to shape and mould. It also assists Australians who struggle to apply their skills in other labour market settings to use those skills and succeed. It is particularly important as an option for people with disability, who still face significant challenges in having their skills recognised by employers. It is interesting to note that people living with disability are more than 40 per cent more likely to be self-employed than the rest of the general population.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it takes time and other support to establish a small business, including financial support. The New Enterprise Incentive Scheme has operated for over 35 years across Australia, and it is designed to assist people receiving Job Network or Centrelink services to develop and launch their own small business. It was established by the Hawke Labor government and was launched as a pilot program on the first day of July in 1985. This scheme was very much designed to help unemployed Australians create their own employment opportunities and to provide a safety net for those just starting out, allowing them to start earning income from their new business while the scheme allowance was paid. The scheme was established as an ongoing program in 1987 after an evaluation report identified it was having a positive effect on sustained self-employment. In 1988, the program was modified to allow private-sector and non-government organisations to deliver NEIS services. Run through the department of education, skills and employment, it provides training in how to develop, plan and execute a business, and then allows people to operate their business with supported funding for up to 12 months. The program provides small-business training and 12 months of personalised mentoring support from contracted business owners or identified mentors. During the 12 months, NEIS participants are offered an allowance equal to basic JobSeeker rates for up to nine months and rent assistance for up to six months. Since 1985 the NEIS has successfully helped over 198,000 business to start and run a small business.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Small businesses are particularly significant employers in the agriculture, forestry and fishing, rental hiring and real estate, construction, professional, scientific and technical services sectors. While the industries change over time, the most common sectors for new NEIS businesses are hospitality, retail trade, transport and logistics, and professional services. In 2012 concurrency for Disability Employment Service participants was introduced, allowing DES participants to have specialised disability supports while also accessing specialised small-business support from a NEIS provider.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2016, as part of the Encouraging Entrepreneurship and Self-Employment Initiative, a range of new elements were announced to enhance the program. These included Exploring Being My Own Boss workshops, aimed at encouraging people to explore whether self-employment would be right for them, with 1,000 workshop places available each year plus an additional 2,300 places made available each year to provide more opportunities. Eligibility to access the program was also broadened to allow people not on income support to access services. This was the first time the scheme was available to people that were not jobseekers on income support. However, people that were not in receipt of income support were not eligible to access the allowance. That allowance is equivalent to the single 22-or-over no-children rate of JobSeeker payment, which is $642.70 per fortnight. Entrepreneurship Facilitators focused on youth and the mature aged were also introduced in areas of high youth and mature-age unemployment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2016 the high-disadvantage trial began, targeting a range of disadvantaged cohorts, including migrants, people with disabilities and those from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. Six hundred places were allocated to providers to deliver these services. In 2018 the high-disadvantage trial was amended to focus on assisting migrants and refugees with NEIS providers, and they were able to access these places on an as-needed basis. Feedback from the trial indicated participants found that flexible training much better suited their needs. They valued the increased mentoring and coaching to develop business plans and started operating businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2020 eligibility to access the scheme was amended to support part-time businesses to assist those with caring responsibilities or working part time. Microbusinesses impacted by COVID-19 were also able to access support to pivot their business to remain viable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From 1 July 2021 veterans transitioning out of the Australian Defence Force were able to access workshops and commence NEIS training while still in the ADF to explore self-employment while still employed. Strong demand emerged during COVID-19, with fewer traditional jobs available. Many jobseekers sought to create their own job by starting a new small business. Additional places for the NEIS program were made available to recognise this demand. Running alongside this is the Entrepreneurship Facilitators program, which complements the Self-Employment Assistance program by promoting self-employment. It helped people to start and run their own business by providing information and advice, and by referring people to appropriate support services, including self-employment assistance providers. As of July this year, the Self-Employment Assistance program effectively replaces the NEIS and builds on its success through additional and more-tailored services that allow participants to choose what support they need for their small business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Self-Employment Assistance, or SEA, program commenced in all 51 employment regions across Australia and is a larger and revised version of the NEIS. It retains the successful components of NEIS while making small changes to small business and entrepreneurship services to make them more flexible and easier for jobseekers exiting and for microbusiness owners to access.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill we are considering, the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Self-Employment Programs and Other Measures) Bill 2022 amends the social security law and related elements of the veterans and the family laws. It is designed to make it clear that the law operates in the same way when participants access self-employment through services through the Self-Employment Assistance program. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The SEA initiative aims to promote self-employment through a range of activities, including microbusiness courses, business planning, business advice and business health checks. New program features include idea generation and introduction to self-employment workshops, an increased number of eligible participants and a range of flexible services. Self-employment assistance includes additional individual support components such as business plan development, business advice sessions and business health checks. Overall, Self-Employment Assistance is a more flexible and tailored program and allows participants to access the service components in any order, based on their individual needs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Providers also need to ensure that their services are accessible to all participants, including those with poor digital literacy, those from CALD backgrounds and those without access to appropriate technology and information, so people who may have experienced barriers to entrepreneurship in the past can now engage in the scheme through a wider range of services. This builds on the flexibilities that were recently introduced which allow individuals with part-time employment, education or caring responsibilities to access effective small business support. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes made to the scheme recognise the changing nature of small business ownership in Australia by giving participants, including individuals from a diverse range of backgrounds, greater flexibility in choosing which support they need to start and run their business, how they can access it and when they receive it. It is intended that the micro-enterprises will receive services that are more flexible and authentic. In this changing and often unpredictable economic environment, eligible business owners who have recently started trading or who need help to adapt their business can access appropriate business mentoring and advice. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As was the case under the NEIS, eligible income support recipients who access the program can receive a self-employment allowance from the government. This helps supplement the income a participant earns from their business so they can reinvest their business earnings in the business. Self-Employment Assistance is building on the NEIS's legacy of success by continuing its valuable support, but through more flexible services that help a wider range of people secure their future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know this program works. NEIS has achieved excellent results from a diverse range of participants who have accessed its services. Three months after exiting the program, 82 per cent of participants remained in employment, and 68 per cent were still running their business. And it supported women's economic security, with more than half of the participants who accessed NEIS over the past seven years being women. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently we've also seen a clear demonstration that the government can play a key role in helping businesses adapt in uncertain times. Since the onset of COVID, the NEIS has helped many businesses pivot to deliver services in new and innovative ways to remain viable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will update the social security, veterans and family laws to make it clear that the Self-Employment Assistance payments will be treated in the same way by the law as any other NEIS payment. The same will apply if the employment secretary ever notifies of a different name for Self-Employment Assistance. The bill will therefore provide increased clarity for participants as they support themselves by establishing the businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just one example of many exciting outcomes of the scheme is The Mountain Experience abseiling and rock climbing adventures based at Mount Wellington in Tasmania. After 10 years of working for other people as a tour guide and rock climber—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:20</span>):  Over the past 2½ years, Australians have witnessed the rise of the unelected and unaccountable bureaucrat. We've witnessed the power these people now have over our lives. During this time, expert health officials incessantly pushed for lockdowns, mandates and other nonsensical restrictions, restrictions which have proven to be both moral and medical failures. Doctors with concerns about the response to COVID found that nameless and faceless figures from the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency—AHPRA—would suspend their licences to practise medicine if they contradicted the bureaucracy's narratives, even in private, thus dismantling the doctor-patient confidentiality relationship and the idea of trusting your doctor's personal expertise rather than bureaucratic edicts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Incomprehensible rules and pointless procedures are the bread and butter of bureaucracies. In fact, the word 'bureaucracy' itself means literally 'rule by desk', which is fitting, as very often these rules are made quite distant from those whose lives their decisions affect. Over the decades, parliaments have passed more and more laws and more and more regulations. We've hired more and more public servants, therefore, in order to ensure that those administrative matters are taken into account. These departments were created to fix problems, but they are concerned with justifying their internal processes rather than delivering measurable outcomes. The system has hidden behind experts telling us to blindly trust the science and refrain from asking questions using basic logic. Anyone who has been paying even the slightest amount of attention can see that many of the so-called experts have been wrong on virtually every point in the last two years, from lockdowns to the injections being safe and effective. Bureaucrats like to keep the fear alive to solidify their own importance and therefore their own funding. If there's one word I never want to hear again, it's 'modelling'. When was the last model that was proven in hindsight to be accurate?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just the COVID experience which bells the cat on the rise of big government; one only has to look at the intrusions by government into our lives in areas like the climate, the surveillance state and the rise of the quasi-state operatives, and the apparatchiks of the big government ethos in universities and in schools, and a woke corporate sector and its insidious ESG agenda. Politicians must stop simply enforcing the whims of bureaucrats and the so-called experts. We exist to serve you, the Australian people, not to control your lives. There's an old biblical teaching which states, 'The greatest among you shall be your servant.' This is the basis for the Western ethos of political leadership. In the entire history of mankind, there has never been a bureaucracy which is sincerely and genuinely concerned about people.</span>

                  </span>Always question everything. Always look for ulterior motives. Why have they allowed Australians to be vilified? Why have they allowed Australians to be thrown out of jobs and discriminated against? Is it because they care so much about our safety? Or is it something else—something more sinister? Nobody should ever take the risk on the promise of being granted their freedom back. This is the stuff of tyrannical authoritarianism, and I hope Australian politics realises that Australians have had enough of having their lives run by people far removed from them. This is Australia, not the People's Republic of China. We should be governed by the lowest and least centralised level of authority as possible to preserve our basic freedoms, including freedom of movement, speech and choice. It's time we scaled back the power of these bureaucracies, and it's time for politicians who say they love this country to go out and prove it. It's time we drain the billabong.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:24</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I'm speaking to the answers Minister Gallagher provided—or, rather, failed to provide—to my questions on gender dysphoria treatment. In avoiding the answer to my questions, the minister tried weakly to say, 'Nothing to see here.' Yet the world is waking up to the profoundly inhuman medical and psychological harms that children with gender dysphoria are experiencing when referred to gender clinics. The international trend is moving away from prescribing puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones to children under 18 years. Britain's infamous—and the world's largest—gender clinic, Tavistock, is now closing, following a review that found it failed vulnerable under-18s: it failed vulnerable under-18s! It follows the clinics in Finland, Sweden and France suspending the availability of puberty blockers and sex hormones to children unless under strict clinical trials.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How did we get to this place, where the power of ideology and trans activism is greater than the rightful duty and obligations of parents, and of the medical and legal professions to provide whole-of-person care for children with gender dysphoria? This woke ideological movement is suffering binary dysphoria. Apparently, for some, a binary world is not sufficiently colourful. Some parents are now forced to abrogate their parental responsibility to the power of the medical state. Fundamental facts are being ignored about children and child development. Fact: contrary to some views, sex is assigned at conception—not birth. We all know that adolescence is a highly challenging time, marked with a preoccupation of the discovery of self. It's okay that a percentage of both genders don't conform to traditional stereotypes. This doesn't need correcting through irreversible medical treatments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ideologically driven activists have intimidated the medical profession into silence and compliance with the affirmation model rather than making a stand for our children who are in distress during adolescence and who need holistic or whole-of-person care. When puberty blockers are administered we know, firstly, that a child cannot develop fertility—the latter stages of puberty do that—and, secondly, that they will not have full sexual function. Essentially, this child's body becomes frozen in the early stages of puberty, with testosterone or oestrogen treatment adulterating the child and committing the child to a lifetime of hormones and drugs. It's unknown what effect puberty blockers have on brain development, and only now is The Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne conducting research in this area. Too bad for all those children who have already passed through, and those currently receiving treatment. Endocrinologists traditionally treated diseases, yet in gender clinics they take perfectly healthy children with no diseases and inject them with puberty blockers to suppress normal hormone levels, to treat not an endocrine disease but the mental distress the child is experiencing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How has this gone unchecked for so long? Why are these medical professionals not subject to disciplinary action for deliberately harming our children? What are governments doing while this is going on? Endocrinologists know the importance of puberty to the full development of a healthy human being. Today gender clinics give medical professionals a licence to offer up puberty as an option to children. The transgender lens has compromised the full care of our children. Gender clinics in Australia need to close and follow the lead of the Tavistock clinic in anchoring whole-person care back to localised clinics within the mental health system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our children are making decisions that they can't possibly understand—decisions with lifelong consequences. They are being sterilised and denied full sexual function, and their brain development is likely compromised. They are being made sick when they're not physically sick. They are being denied the therapeutic support they need to help them with their distress. Instead of asking why there has been an explosion of girls presenting with gender dysphoria in Western countries, the medical profession has bowed down to the trans activists and grabbed the opportunity to create profits and research outcomes at the expense of our children—inhuman!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Adults in Australia's gender clinics must not be allowed to hide behind a statement of operating to the standards of care. There is no care when the medical profession does not fully deal with the mental health issues that children are experiencing. There is no care when the medical professional takes physically healthy children and sends them on a pathway of drugs, infertility and arrested physical, sexual and neurological development for the rest of their lives. There is no care when state government legislation denies parents their rightful place in support of their children in distress. Our children are not fodder for experimentation and advancing research outcomes for the medical profession. Our children are not profit centres for pharmaceutical companies. We are one community, we are one nation and this child abuse must stop now.</span>

Last month I had the immense honour of attending and being able to participate in the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program, which I know is probably something that you have experienced yourself in a previous role here in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was fortunate enough to travel to Hawaii, along with the member for Cowper, Pat Conaghan, for Exercise Rim of the Pacific. RIMPAC, as it's commonly known, is the world's largest international maritime exercise, and this year featured personnel and vessels from no less than 26 nations. Together, participants contributed some 38 surface vessels, four submarines and more than 140 aircraft, with many of these being drawn from the defence forces of some of our most important allies in our region, including the United States, Japan and India. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's contribution to RIMPAC this year was substantial, featuring the flagship of the Royal Australian Navy, the HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Canberra</span>. We also had the replenishment oiler HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Supply</span> and the Anzac class frigate HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Warramunga</span>. Along with these naval vessels were two of our P-8A Poseidon aircraft of the Royal Australian Air Force, and a joint landing force led by the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, accompanied by personnel and capabilities from right across a variety of Australian Army units. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those of my colleagues who have been fortunate enough to participate in the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program will know full well just how valuable this program is. Established back in 2001, it allows parliamentarians the opportunity to experience firsthand the dedication that our men and women of the Australian Defence Force have to keeping our country safe. In putting on that uniform, they're not just doing themselves and their families proud; they're doing our nation proud. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my time in this place, I've been very fortunate to interact with these fine men and women on a number of occasions, and I've been struck by the patriotism that they share and the generosity that they have towards us. On this occasion, of course, it was no different, and we were warmly welcomed at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii, by two fine individuals: Commander Dean Uren and Flying Officer Rushdi Dai, and I can't thank them enough what they did in looking after me and Mr Conaghan for our last eight days in Hawaii.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally warm was our welcome by the Australian Consul-General in Honolulu, Andrea Gleason. As Australia's foremost diplomatic representative in Hawaii, Ms Gleason was keen to share her thoughts on how we can improve our presence in the region and deepen our strong relationship with the United States. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There can be no doubting that Australian consulate staff perform essential work, providing important assistance to Australians abroad when they sometimes fall foul, or just need some advice from their government, and promoting our country to the international community. It's not often that we get to meet and thank them in person, and I am grateful to have had this opportunity to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The part of my journey that really exposed me to the everyday work of our ADF personnel, however, was the three nights that I spent with Pat on board the HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Canberra</span>. Witnessing firsthand the operation of this impressive vessel, I gained an even stronger appreciation for the professionalism, selflessness and courage of our service personnel. I met so many highly skilled, professional Aussie characters on board, and I wish to put on the record here in the Senate my appreciation for them taking the time to so patiently explain the various routines of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Canberra</span> to us on board. To show our gratitude, we had the pleasure of cooking a meal for the crew, and I'm reliably advised that it went down a treat. We helped to separate the waste, quite literally getting our hands dirty. We did all the things that our men and women in uniform do every single day, often with little fanfare or acknowledgement. Overall, I had a wonderful experience on board HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Canberra</span>, and I want to thank everyone who welcomed and assisted me over those three days. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ASKEW</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:34</span>):  I want to take the opportunity tonight to highlight an iconic Tasmanian tourist destination, Bridestowe Lavender Estate, in Nabowla, in Tasmania's north-east. Bridestowe is celebrating its 100th year in 2022, and I dropped in earlier this year to see the stunning purple fields during their peak flowering season. Bridestowe shot to worldwide fame in 2013-14, when numerous Chinese models and actors took to social media with photos of the farm's mascot, Bobbie the bear, and when Chinese President Xi Jinping was gifted one on his first visit to Tasmania, in 2014.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bridestowe Lavender Estate owner Robert Ravens told me the farm's iconic rows of lavender had formed the backdrop of thousands of selfies on social media, with visitors often holding one of the business's famous purple lavender ice creams in their photo foreground. Mr Ravens purchased the farm in 2007, not knowing anything about lavender or how to grow and harvest the crop. He is a well-known and highly regarded member of the Northern Tasmanian community. As well as running the farm, Mr Ravens is a member of the Reserve Bank of Australia Small Business Finance Advisory Panel and was the 2022 Waratah-Wynyard Council's Australia Day ambassador. The farm itself has also won numerous awards, including the inaugural Australia China Business Council award for entrepreneurship and influence in China and the 2016 Telstra Tasmanian Business of the Year, and has been voted as one of eight must-visit destinations in Australia by travel website Webjet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bridestowe Lavender Estate is the world's largest privately owned lavender farm. The French lavender harvested from the more than 650,000 plants at the farm is used to create perfume, premium oil, cosmetics, teas, soaps and, of course, Bobbie the bear. I have purchased many such products as gifts and mementos over the years myself, as did my late mother.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Bridestowe Lavender Estate is a very well established agritourism venture that draws tourists from across Tasmania, Australia and the globe. However, the 260-acre farm's original location was not at Nabowla. Bridestowe's lavender farm was established in 1922 at North Lilydale, almost a 30-minute drive from its current site. Keith Denny, who had previously worked as an accountant for London perfumery Cleaver's, dreamed of producing the world's finest lavender. His research showed Tasmania's climate and conditions were similar to those of Provence but the island state was free of contamination, which was an issue in France at the time due to World War I. North Lilydale was deemed the best location, and Mr Denny planted seeds sourced from the French Alps, naming the farm Bridestowe after the church where his father was rector for 39 years. By 1924 Bridestowe was producing enough flowers to distil oil, and a sample was sent to London for analysis. The Tasmanian produced sample was considered of at least equal quality to French oil, and, in addition, it was low in camphor—the ingredient that can make some lavender scents unpleasant—showing Mr Denny was onto a good thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This quest for the finest lavender continues today, 100 years later, with flowers harvested at the optimum time in January for peak quality and oil production. I was able to watch the oil distillation process during my visit, seeing how Bridestowe's pure lavender oil is collected in the distillery. The Denny family designed a revolutionary curved rose to capture rainfall in a controlled-spill way which traps water for reuse and reduces erosion. This is just one of the efficiencies employed at the farm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today Bridestowe's other sustainable practices include native plantings in areas not farmed to increase biodiversity and controlled pests; hand weeding with little reliance on herbicides; plant prunings, cardboard and paper composted and returned to enrich the soil; regular resting of production areas and rotational cropping to improve soil quality; solar panels, energy-efficient lighting and skylights to reduce energy use; and on-site flower drying using the sun.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fortunately, the innovative working farm I have just described can be experienced by anyone. I walked between the rows of lavender like many of the tourists who visited on the same day I did. I also enjoyed a cup of lavender grey tea at Bridestowe's cafe and listened to the pleasant hum of families and friends enjoying their holidays and planning what they would do next. I topped up my stores of culinary lavender and tea while watching visitors pose for photos with the huge Bobbie bear in the gift shop.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bridestowe Lavender Estate really is a wonderful example of Tasmania's agricultural tourism on show. Its purple fields are a huge drawcard for the state's northern region, and the Ravens family's commitment to innovation continues the legacy the Dennys began a century ago.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FARUQI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:39</span>):  Many people will have known a teacher who lit a spark of passion in them or rekindled a flickering flame to its full burning potential. For me it was Dr Ronnie Harding. She played an instrumental role in feeding my hunger to learn more about nature and in nourishing my ability to protect it. We often had discussions about the climate crisis and how big, bold changes were needed to tackle it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ronnie passed away peacefully on Saturday 18 June. She will be missed sorely by so many friends, loved ones, colleagues and students. Ronnie touched the lives and the hearts of whoever she met, and I include my husband, my children and my mother in that list. She had the incredible ability to be genuinely interested in others. People like Ronnie don't come around often—perhaps even just once in your lifetime.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Ronnie Harding was a teacher extraordinaire, my lecturer, my colleague, my mentor and my dearest friend. We wrote a book together with another colleague, exploring the complexities and contestations of environmental decision-making. At a difficult period in my life, she reached out and convinced me to play table tennis with her every week. She went about her brilliant teaching and research, and her environmentalism and caring for people, in an unassuming, matter-of-fact way, never making a big deal of the positive, life-changing impact she was having on so many.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Above all, Ronnie was an incredible environmentalist—a pioneer in environmental education. Ronnie was the founding member of the Institute of Environmental Studies at UNSW, where I got my dream job, teaching the outstanding Master of Environmental Management program which she'd started. It was a world-first interdisciplinary program on the environment and sustainability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Right before I delivered my first lecture, I remember my heart was beating fast and my hands were sweaty with apprehension. I wanted to be a good teacher, but I was really nervous about not knowing answers to questions a student might ask me or not meeting their expectations. Ronnie came to my office to wish me luck. Seeing my anxiety, she stopped to have a chat, and gave me some advice that I have carried with me ever since—advice on being true to myself; on being honest and not pretending to know everything; on not being afraid to be challenged; and, above all, on valuing the knowledge others have. 'They just want to have a yarn, really,' she said. When I was feeling a similar nervousness on my first day in the New South Wales parliament, I remembered Ronnie's wisdom on being true to myself. And I do that every single day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ronnie's talents and interests were never-ending. She had an arts degree from the University of Sydney; and a science degree, first-class honours, and a PhD in marsupial reproductive biology from UNSW. She was an intellectual, and very skilled in the sporting field. She excelled in hurdling and long jump, as well as tennis and golf. During her student days, she restored and repaired chairs. Later, she refurbished an old fisherman's cottage. Ronnie's love for travel was well known, and I would never tire of hearing about her adventures around the world—in India, Singapore, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, South America and Europe, to name a few. She found the time and the energy to dedicate to so many other roles, including being an Assistant Commissioner for the New South Wales Natural Resources Commission, a trustee of the Australian Museum, a board member of the Environmental Defenders Office, a member of the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists, a member of the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Advisory Council, and so many more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I feel so honoured to have known Ronnie for a few decades. I know that hundreds of her master's students and colleagues feel the same, and here are some of their words: 'What a legend she was. She was my mentor and my inspiration.' 'She opened my eyes to the fact engineering is not just a bunch of formulas to stop bridges falling over.' 'What a giant in her field.' 'She also made me laugh so often with her fierce honesty about how she saw the world.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is absolutely no doubt that the work Ronnie did in her lifetime is going to live on in her many and dear students, colleagues and friends, and I will be one of those honouring her memory in my life and my work. Vale, 'Ronnie' Ronald Harding.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="140651" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'NEILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:43</span>):  I rise to make a contribution about an event that occurred in Sydney on Easter Sunday earlier this year, where I was privileged to join the leadership of the Irish National Association at Waverley cemetery to give the 2022 Michael Dwyer Oration, which is essentially about the contribution of Irish Australians to this great nation and the colourful history that binds our two nations together. My oration traversed the tableau of the Irish struggle for justice and independence, and the 1798 memorial itself is a reminder of the 1798 Wexford uprising. A man by the name of Michael Dwyer, along with a number of other political prisoners, ended up in Australia. Upon his death, Dwyer was buried not far from Central Station. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A hundred years later a large number of his Irish descendants and members of the Irish community in Sydney decided that they would re-inter his remains at Waverley Cemetery. The 1798 Memorial in Waverley Cemetery is a remarkable marble edifice dedicated to the efforts of those 'rebels', as they were called at the time, but 'patriots' as they are called retrospectively by those who seek a united Ireland. A hundred thousand people actually gathered along the streets from Central Station in Sydney all the way out to Waverley Cemetery, where he was re-interred. Ten thousand people walked from St Mary's Cathedral, as a testament of hope and power to what one brave person in search of democracy, in a particular context in time, can engender. It was an amazing experience and a true honour as an Australian, but the daughter of Irish immigrants, to be at that Easter celebration. It's not surprising it happens at Easter, which is a time of significant memorials in Ireland about the Easter Rising of 1916.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year, 2022, is actually a hundred years since the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, and I was particularly delighted to discuss the proud history of female members of the Irish Dail. They contributed to the debate regarding the 1922 Treaty, and each of them—all of the women in that first Dail—rejected the treaty because they thought it would plunge Ireland into further turmoil. It is very interesting to look—a hundred years down the track—and see in the papers in Ireland at the moment a lot of discussion about what a united Ireland for this century might look like. So the struggle continues. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1922, Constance Markievicz was the first female member of the UK House of Commons—she was elected from prison—and became the first female cabinet member in Europe. Ada English, a doctor who graduated from the Royal University of Ireland, spoke out against the oath and the Anglo-Irish Treaty and the very notion of being British subjects. Kathleen Clarke, her husband having recently been martyred by British troops, opposed the treaty, saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There is not power enough to force me, nor eloquence enough to influence me, in the whole British Empire into taking that Oath, though I am only a frail scrap of humanity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Margaret Pearse, likewise, spoke of her two recently killed sons, particularly Padraig Pearse—one of the most prominent martyrs of the Easter Rising. These women proudly stood up for their beliefs and for their country, and I was privileged to tell a little of their lives to the wonderful attendees on that day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I acknowledge the leadership of the Irish National Association of Australasia in bringing about this memorialising of the struggle for democracy for people who are Irish and interested in the history of Ireland. I particularly want to thank the INA and its leadership, which makes this an annual event around which people gather.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to remind everybody that the Australian Irish connection has been very significant in Australian politics. Ben Chifley, the train driver turned Treasurer, helped shape the postwar order. James Scullin, Joe Cahill and Jack Renshaw were other Irish Australians who were extremely prominent figures in New South Wales and national politics. And now of course we have Anthony Albanese, of an Irish Australian mother, building his own profound legacy as we speak.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the Senate for the opportunity to put this important occasion on the record. To share histories of other countries is very instructive for us as citizens of this great country as we make our way forward to develop a stronger, more robust and more reflective democracy. Struggle is part of the journey, and we honour the struggle of those who've gone before us in the pursuit of democracy.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:53</span>):  The denuclearisation imperative has rarely been more urgent than it is right now, and it is incumbent upon the government to make all possible efforts towards its achievement. One of the best instruments we have against the ever-present threat of nuclear weapons is the United Nations Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. The former coalition government resisted signing on to the TPNW for years, but while in opposition Anthony Albanese committed Labor to signing the treaty. Indeed, in 2018 the Labor Party even adopted a resolution that committed to signing and ratifying the TPNW in government. This is what the opposition leader at the time then said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Today we have an opportunity to take a step towards their elimination.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to repeat that for the record. The quote was, 'Labor will sign and ratify the treaty.' Former foreign minister Gareth Evans also said that nuclear disarmament is 'core business of any Labor government worth the name'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet since taking office in May, the Prime Minister's historic opportunity to follow through on this particular moment in time seems to have gone nowhere. Save for a flimsy statement in June that Australia 'shares the ambition' of the TPNW and that state parties of the world should work together for 'a world without nuclear weapons', the government has been troublingly quiet. To their credit, the statement was made as the government sent an observer to the first meeting of the state parties to the TPNW. But this is an infuriatingly empty gesture in the broader context of the Albanese government's unwavering support for AUKUS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The AUKUS pact is provocative and poses a grave risk to global nuclear nonproliferation. Questions are now even being raised about whether it violates the non-proliferation treaty to which Australia is a party. Just this week, Indonesia voiced their concerns that it may undermine the non-proliferation treaty itself. That doesn't appear to concern the PM, who has repeatedly affirmed that Labor's strong backing of AUKUS will continue, as well as affirming an appetite for expanding the US alliance. That is completely antithetical to the principle of denuclearisation. The TPNW and AUKUS are fundamentally incompatible. You either support denuclearisation or you don't, so I am forced to ask the question of the Prime Minister: which is it? The only workable answer here is to decisively denounce nuclear weapons by signing the very treaty that you yourself have vocally and repeatedly committed to supporting. That is our duty as responsible global citizens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia must play a constructive role towards global disarmament, and we must not delay any longer. Almost 80 per cent of Australians back signing the treaty. The Labor Party's membership back signing the treaty. The Greens have absolutely and unwaveringly backed the treaty from the beginning. I am calling on the Albanese government to act on the will of the community and the mandate of its own party and sign the treaty as a matter of urgency. We have the overwhelming support of the Australian community, we have the numbers in parliament and we know that it is the right thing to do. Let's get it done.</span>

They are much more common than we realise, and this is an issue that needs to be taken more seriously. This is also an issue that affects all levels of sport, not just elite sport. It affects community sports and it also seriously affects our children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Concussions are not just a knock on the head; they are actually brain injuries. We need to provide better education and change our language and culture around this issue. We need change to ensure that our athletes do not have long-term cognitive impairment due to concussions so that they and their families don't suffer from the consequences of playing or competing in a sport they love.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A new international research paper just published by concussion experts, including from Australia, has shown links between repetitive head trauma, such as is caused by concussion, and risks of brain damage and neurodegenerative disease. That includes diseases such as dementia, motor neuron disease and Parkinson's. Concussions can cause fatigue, mood disorders, depression and anxiety. None of us want our loved ones to experience this. We cannot allow our major sports to drive the narrative that they have sorted this issue, nor can we believe them when they say that they take athletes' health and welfare as their highest priority. We see too many examples where athletes are expected to return to competition as quickly as possible, or where athletes are concussed multiple times in a season yet are cleared to return.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What pains me most is the way that concussions can impact the health of our children. The earlier concussions are experienced and the more often throughout one's life, the stronger the impact. Already, we have evidence that one-third of our children, at a young age, suffer depression after a concussion. In England there is no tackling in rugby for under-nine-year-olds or heading of the soccer ball for people under 12. In New Zealand there is no tackling for under-nine-year-olds and in Canada for people under 11. There is no reason we cannot set our age to protect our children. They can still learn to play. They can still enjoy the sport, maybe even more so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must also have independent research, not sport funded research where scientists and medical doctors are expected to provide sport-friendly findings. We must have a Senate inquiry to ascertain the scope of where we are at with the science and why athletes at all levels and ages are being allowed to return to play too soon after their brain injury.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should not be afraid to address this issue. I love sport. I've grown up with sport, and, to be honest, sport saved me. I don't know where I would be without having grown up with the sport-fanatic family and community that I am still apart of today. I don't know where I would be without it. I know the importance of sport for all of our communities, particularly regional and remote communities. That is all the more reason to make sure that we can all safely play the sports that we love—so we can play them for longer, and so we can do what we love in life for longer and not be affected by injuries and their long-term consequences on us and our families. Today I want to bring awareness to this issue. Let's start a debate about concussion in sport, and let's include everyone.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:03</span>):  Today, of course, is 2 August, and for well over a year we've had the vaccine rollout. Every day I still hear from people that have suffered injuries from the vaccine or suffer through mandates or suffer some form of discrimination. We have recently passed through about 10,000 cases of COVID in the last six months. If that's not evidence to say that the vaccines aren't effective, then I don't know what is. However, I'm not here tonight to talk about the ineffectiveness of the vaccine, which didn't stop transmission. I'm here to talk about how unsafe the vaccines are, and I want to explain why; I want to go through the biochemistry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The COVID virus has 29 proteins in it. Normally, if you gave someone a deattenuated vaccine, you would take out the ionised molecule of that virus. So, if you've got 29 molecules, you'd take out one, and the one you'd take out is the ionised molecule. An ion either has more electrons than protons or, likewise, more protons than electrons. Either way, it's a charge, and that's what they call the active ingredient in a vaccine. If you've got two magnets, one with a north pole and one with a south pole, and the magnets go past each other, they want to attach. That's why a vaccine is normally deattenuated. They take out that ionised molecule so it doesn't go around jumping on everything. But what that does is it allows the antibody to attack the antigen, end of story.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing is that, because that molecule is still quite large—with 28 molecules remaining in a normal deattenuated vaccine—it is too big to cross the endothelium. What is the endothelium? It is the small capillary between your muscle tissue and your bloodstream. In order to cross that capillary, you've got to be small enough, in a process called endocytosis, to cross into the bloodstream. What this particular vaccine does is it delivers a lipid nanoparticle. It is a very tiny particle, much smaller—by a factor of 1,000—than a normal virus. What that means is it can travel from the tissue, through the endothelium and into your bloodstream.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, we know that's the way this particular vaccine works because if you go to table 4.2 in the TGA nonclinical evaluation report, you will see where they have done the distribution of the lipid nanoparticles on the lab rats—literally—when they injected this particular vaccine. I'll read out some of the body organs that it went through and the concentration increases. For a start, I want to focus on the ovaries. The concentration levels are milligrams to each gram. By the end of the first 25 minutes, it was 0.1. By the end of the first day, it was 5.25. By the end of the second day, it was 12.26. That has doubled after two days.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And that's not the only organ. It went into the liver, the heart, the eyes, the brain, the bone marrow, the bladder and the adrenal glands. Just about half of the vaccine's lipid nanoparticles go into organs other than the injection site. This is despite the fact that we were told that a normal vaccine goes into your deltoid muscle and that's where it stays. Well, that's not the case with this particular vaccine. And what's particularly scary about this is that they knew this in the animal trials, and despite the fact that the concentration was still increasing after 48 hours, do you know what they did? They stopped the trial. Don't you think you would run the trial right through to the point of where the lipid nanoparticles had left the body? They didn't do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But that's just the start of it, because once it gets inside the cell and starts creating the spike protein, that can last for days longer. But here's the thing—in the animal trials they never delivered the spike protein mRNA inside the lipid. They delivered a benign enzyme by the name of luciferase, which is the stuff you see in fireflies, and that lights up so that they could trace it. But, as the TGA nonclinical report says, they never tested the distribution and degradation of the spike protein for this particular vaccine in any humans or animals before they rolled it out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Normally, when you get the virus, it comes in through your mucosal system, and if the immunoglobulin A in your mucosal system doesn't kill the virus it'll eventually get into your systemic blood system. Your mucosal system is driven by immunoglobulin A; your systemic blood system is driven by immunoglobulin G. Once the virus gets in, in order to get inside the cell, it needs to rely on what they called the ACE receptor—which is the angiotensin-converting enzyme—and also the transmembrane serine protease, which is another enzyme. That has to carry the virus across your cell membrane, because your membrane is there to protect the organelles inside the cell—that is, your nucleus, your ribosome and your mitochondria in particular—from external forces. What this particular vaccine does is it makes the lipid catatonic. That means it uses transfection—it's like when you're cooking sausages on the barbecue and you see blobs of fat merge together. That's exactly what happens with transfection. There is no barrier with this particular vaccine to the lipid going into any cell. Not only does it not stop at the deltoid but it also goes all throughout the body, and it can go into any cell because of the way they designed this lipid nanoparticle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once it's inside the cell, normally—now this is a first. Normally, when you get the vaccine, you get the antigen and it doesn't go anywhere near your cell. Once it goes into your cell, it goes into the part of your cell called the ribosome, which translates the mRNA. That ribosome will produce a protein. Normally, the spike protein on the virus is not the same as the spike protein in the vaccine. But, no, what they've done is replace the nucleotide uracil and put in a new nucleotide called methylpseudouridine. That was shown in studies, in 2005, to actually evade the immune system and have greater self-amplifying properties. In other words, it creates more proteins. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only did they modify the mRNA that way; they added another 70 adenine nucleotides at the end of the mRNA strand. Normally, there are about 30 adenine nucleotides at the start of the mRNA strand, but they've added another 70. What does that mean? It means the spike protein lasts a lot longer inside your cell, creating a toxic substance or a toxic molecule that is ionised in an unregulated manner. What I mean by an unregulated manner is that it relies on your immune system to kick in, come in, and destroy your cells. A normal vaccine doesn't do any of that. It stays inside your deltoid muscle. It doesn't go anywhere because it's too big to travel. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what we've got now is a vaccine that has delivered a protein in an unregulated manner. That's similar to a pathway of cancer, where, basically, you get the unregulated reproduction of toxic molecules. Then it relies on your own body's immune system to attack your cells. Where you have your body attacking your own cells, you're now creating a pathway similar to acquired immune deficiency syndrome. If it goes wrong, you do not want your own body attacking your own cells. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next step after that is, effectively, a concentration. When it comes through your mucosal system, if you have a strong, healthy immune system, the immunoglobulin A in that immune system should stop it from getting into your bloodstream. When it's injected directly into your bloodstream, all you're getting is an IgG response. You are not getting an IgA response. So when they said, early on, it was going to stop transmission, that was a blatant lie. And why was it? Anyone that understands anything about immunology knows that you need an immunoglobin A response to kill the virus in your mucosal system, because if you don't kill it in the mucosal systemic you can still transmit it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The paper did show that you got an immunoglobin G response, and that lasted for up to 35 days in monkeys. But those monkeys only weighed 10 kilograms and they were given three times the dose given to humans. It was a greater dose of about 20 times. You could argue that—35 divided by 20 days—maybe, the immunoglobin G response might have lasted for two days. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other point is that, by doing it this way—the pathways they were using—they never tested this before they put it into humans. They never tested it for genotoxicity studies, despite the fact that this was the first time they ever put genes inside a body, and it's synthesised genes. They never did longitudinal testing, they never did carcinogenic testing and they never tested it for other drugs. So people who take other drugs, especially immunosuppressants—they never tested for that. </span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to pay my respects to the team at the Parliamentary Budget Office. I think that they do an outstanding job, and at no time is their job more important than at the time of the federal election. They provide that service in a number of ways. They provide individual senators with costing supports. When individual senators have a proposal, the Parliamentary Budget Office will assist them in working out what the budgetary consequences of that proposal are. They assist parties in preparing their costings. And, more importantly—perhaps most importantly—they provide a service that I think all Australians should take advantage of: determining and judging the impact of different parties' policies, in terms of budgetary outcomes. So I was very interested to read the <span style="font-style:italic;">2022 </span><span style="font-style:italic;">E</span><span style="font-style:italic;">lection commitments report</span>, July 2022, issued by the Parliamentary Budget Office. Something very stark emerged from this report. I'll read from the key points in the summary:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Coalition's platform, if fully implemented, would be expected to result in slightly smaller deficits over both the 2022-23 Budget forward estimates and medium-term periods compared to the PEFO.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So there were slightly smaller deficits over that period of time. It continues:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Coalition's election commitments do not materially change receipts from the PEFO.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fair enough—I'd concur with that. It makes sense. In relation to Labor's platform, it said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Labor's platform, if fully implemented, would result in increased deficits over the same periods relative to the PEFO …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, that is reflective of the commentary that occurred during the campaign.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:14.2pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we get the discussion in relation to the Australian Greens. I think the tens of thousands of Queenslanders who voted for the Greens need to reflect carefully on the Parliamentary Budget Office's election commitments analysis in relation to the Australian Greens. Bear in mind that, in their policy statement, the Greens said, 'The Greens plan is fully costed and fully funded.' Maybe they meant that in a postmodernist sort of way, where matters such as truth, reason and knowledge are all relative, and maybe it was fully costed and fully funded compared to how exotic and bizarre it might have been in the first instance, but the reality is that the Parliamentary Budget Office report shows that the Greens policies would have had an absolutely devastating impact on this country's budgetary position. This is summarised nowhere better than in the table on page 3. Again, I commend the PBO for its work in this regard. In this table it talks firstly about the impact on the underlying cash balance—the net impact of election commitments. The coalition total to 2025-26 is actually an improvement, or would have been an improvement, of $1 billion over that period. The Australian Labor Party had a deteriorating position of $6.9 billion—so the coalition was plus $1 billion and the Australian Labor Party was minus $6.9 billion. Then we get to the Australian Greens. Bear in mind that they said, 'fully costed and fully funded'. If it's fully funded, why is it that the financial implications of their election commitments by 2022-23, through the forward estimates, were minus $26.1 billion? The impact on the headline cash balance of the Australian Greens policies was minus $112.1 billion. This is the fully costed and fully funded Australian Greens election campaigns across the 2022-23 forward estimates. Reflect on those figures. The negative impact on the underlying cash balance of the Australian Greens policies was minus $26.1 billion, the headline cash balance was minus $112.1 billion and the fiscal balance was minus $41 billion. Those are the Australian Greens fully costed, fully funded policies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:14.2pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It gets even worse, and this is where things become challenging for the Parliamentary Budget Office. It would no doubt like to be able to produce some graphs using consistent X- and Y-axes across the different costings regimes under each of the parties, but it's impossible because the Australian Greens are so far out there with their supposedly fully costed and fully funded policies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:14.2pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The net impact of the PBO guidance on the underlying cash balance by party shows that the X-axis for the coalition goes from zero to $1 billion; the X-axis for the Australian Labor Party, which is a materially less position than the coalition's, goes from zero to $9 billion; and the X-axis for the Australian Greens goes from $40 billion to minus $40 billion. That's the only way they could capture how bad the Australian Greens policies would have been for the budget of this country. Then, when you drill down into the individual policies—there's lots of good information on the Parliamentary Budget Office website. I have hundreds of pages here in relation to the costings of the Greens policies, which I intend to go through in depth. I've only had a chance to go through three at the moment. The first was in relation to the so-called corporate super profits tax. It was fully funded, apparently, fully costed. The PBO says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There is a very high degree of uncertainty associated with this costing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a key assumption, the PBO also says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Who would have thought that, if you actually increase taxes on people, they'd respond—for example, by taking their capital offshore with the jobs that go with them? Let's move to the ending corporate tax avoidance policy. We can see a theme here in relation to the Greens policies. Under the costing overview, it says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There is a significant level of uncertainty associated with each component of this proposal and the uncertainty in particular components drives significant uncertainty in the overall cost.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It goes on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Who would have thought that, when you introduce draconian tax policies and measures, people would actually respond? </span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll move to the third policy. This was the granddaddy of all policies, the Greens policy to construct one million homes across Australia. If it's going to be one million, why not 10 million? Our theme continues: </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:23</span>):  Should eligibility for women's sporting events be based on biological sex? Over the last few years, an extraordinary amount of effort has been put into stopping anyone from even asking this question, let alone answering it in the affirmative. Women have been threatened, abused, pilloried and ostracised for pointing out that the purpose of women's sport is to provide fair competition for the female sex. Many lies have been told about female athletes being more than happy to compete against males. Commentators, journalists and politicians alike have claimed that nobody cares about the issue of protecting single-sex women's sport, or those that do care are simply bigots, or that the issue isn't important enough to warrant discussion, or, worst of all, that even talking about women's sex based rights is a form of violence and a form of hate speech.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet, when FINA, the international governing body for swimmers, asked their elite athletes whether eligibility for women's events should be based solely on biological sex, 83.8 per cent of them said yes. More than eight in 10 elite swimmers agree that women's events must be for females. But how can this possibly be, when we've heard the media and activists and politicians repeatedly tell us that female athletes don't care if they're competing against males? This is a lie that many have gotten away with only by refusing to ask female athletes for their views and by bullying, belittling and disparaging women who did speak up and acknowledged that single-sex sport is essential to allow women and girls to participate and compete fairly. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last three years I've been contacted by women in sport at every level, from Olympic medallists to women playing at their local club, who have said how important it is to protect the female category, but how impossible it has been to speak out because of the attitude of the governing bodies in their sports. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two years ago, World Rugby released a detailed report based on extensive scientific analysis which found that female players tackled by male players are at a 25 to 30 per cent greater risk of serious head and neck injuries—two years ago. Yet Rugby Australia last week confirmed that it will continue to allow males to play against women in community rugby competitions around Australia. Rugby Australia is saying to women and girls playing for their local club on a weekend that it couldn't care less if they are being exposed to a 30 per cent increase in serious head and neck injuries. As we stand here today, Australia's three major contact-football codes all encourage the inclusion of male players in the women's competitions at community level—not just allow; encourage. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the rest of the world is starting to wake up and is realising that there is nothing inclusive or scientific about telling female athletes that they have to accept males into their sport, Australian politicians and journalists are still desperately trying to uphold a culture of no debate by denigrating anyone who publicly recognises the need for single-sex sport. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, that's exactly what we've seen from the new Minister for Sport and from her colleagues on the other side of this chamber. The new sports minister has stated that my proposal, tabled in the last parliament, to ensure that single-sex women's sport is lawful, supported and encouraged should—in the minister's words—'go right to the back of the shelf to gather dust'. How is it acceptable that major world sporting bodies like FINA and World Rugby are recognising that single-sex women's sport is essential to fair and safe competition, yet the Australian government is content for our country to have laws that prevent local sporting competitions and clubs from guaranteeing female players won't have to take the field against males? Even our most decorated female Olympians speaking openly about the reality of sport—that fairness in women's sport is not compatible with male inclusion in the female category—hasn't been able to prompt reflection or a change of course from our media and many peak sporting bodies in Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead, we are now hearing the excuse that fairness matters only at the elite level. What an insult to the millions of Australians who play their sport at community and local level. According to this new excuse, fairness is a privilege to be granted only to the elite one per cent, yet fairness is no less important at sub-elite levels of sport. A race can be won by a split second, whether it's at the Olympics or at a local swimming club. A local football grand final is just as likely to be decided by one point as the AFL Grand Final. A woman playing rugby at her local club is just as likely to have her neck broken or her brain injured as a professional player.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's the pinnacle of elitism to claim, as some have, that local sport is just about fun and fitness. All of us in this parliament would know many women and men and boys and girls who put their heart and soul into winning games for their local club. They train two to three nights a week after work. They slog it out in the off-season, getting as fit as they can to help their team get over the line, and, when they step onto the field, they are trying as hard as they can to compete and to win. For their governing bodies and their governments to say to those women and girls that they are not entitled to the same level of fairness that elite athletes are entitled to is simply wrong. And, if you remove that fairness from any level of competitive sport, the result will undoubtedly be that many women and girls stop playing. Policies like the one that FINA has adopted, supported in overwhelming numbers by its athletes, help ensure that the reality of sex differences in sport is acknowledged and respected by maintaining a single-sex female category.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But Australian sports aren't free to adopt policies like FINA's. Australia's antidiscrimination laws would prevent a policy like FINA's from being adopted here. The Minister for Sport and the Prime Minister have made clear that they're perfectly happy for Australian sport clubs and volunteers to continue to face legal action if they offer single-sex sport for women. And they're perfectly happy to dismiss concerns as a so-called right-wing issue, proving that they're really not listening to female sporting champions from all around Australia and the world. Nor are they listening to the sportswomen around this country and the parents of girls playing sport, who just want their sports and their daughters' sports to be fair and safe. Australia is at risk of being left behind while sensible people and organisations all around the world are waking up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian governments spend tens of millions of dollars on sport every year, often on the basis of providing opportunities to women and girls in sport, yet many commentators are desperate to prevent debate and say that politicians should stay out of this issue. That's absolute rubbish! That is exactly how you end up with lobby groups and Twitter activists setting the rules, establishing the culture and telling women that they're bigots for wanting single-sex sport and spaces.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If sport is important enough for the government to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on, then it's important enough for elected representatives to speak up, as often as we must, to ensure that Australian women and girls aren't being thrown under the bus for the sake of a misogynistic and misguided ideology.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:31</span>):  Tonight I wish to expose the hypocrisy of a prominent authority on disinformation and the architect of the teals' digital campaign. In October 2021, an astroturfing campaign named, 'We love our hospitals'—WLOH—surfaced on social media. It had a website and a Facebook and Instagram presence. The website mostly featured generic stock photos of hospital scenes, but one image featured what appeared to be surgeons in scrubs holding up a sign that had been amateurly photoshopped to include the WLOH logo.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cam Wilson, Crikey's associate editor, was the first to twig to this mysterious astroturfing campaign, in an article titled 'Who's spending $10K on anti-Morrison Facebook ads? We don't know—and that's a problem'. Find it and read it. According to Crikey, the 'about' section of WLOH's Facebook page claimed that it's for showing appreciation 'for our hospitals and the wonderful people who work in them'. But the page's posts focused on attacking the federal coalition government for a lack of hospital funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to appreciate that, in October 2021, after 10 months hovering under 100, COVID hospitalisations had risen to a new peak of around 1,500, with 300 people in intensive care. After the Crikey article, the Facebook page was deleted and the website was amended to remove imagery and references.</span>

                  </a>  Very funny! However, Facebook's ad library still contains three of the WLOH's digital ads, on which it spent $12,136, targeted at audiences in Queensland and Tasmania.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are several clues as to the not-so-clever creator's identity. Open-source information analyst Elise Thomas noted on Twitter that the metadata of the image of surgeons holding up a sign which had been amateurly photoshopped to include the logo shows it was created on 28 September by user 'Ed', using the design tool, Canva. The image of the logo was also created by Ed on the same day. The logo is still on the weloveourhospitals.org site, accessible by Wayback, and also contains a reference to Ed in the metadata.</span>

A year ago, Ed Coper warned <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald </span>readers about the evils of digital astroturfing, whereby an organisation is passed off as grassroots and its true origin or agenda is obscured. Surely that Ed Coper couldn't be the author of a despicable, ugly astroturfing campaign aimed at blaming the Morrison government over hospital funding at the time of rising COVID admissions? But hang on! In his book <span style="font-style:italic;">Facts </span><span style="font-style:italic;">and </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Other Li</span><span style="font-style:italic;">es</span>, this Ed Coper described Labor's federal 2016 digital campaign, which falsely claimed the coalition would privatise Medicare. In that same breath, he admits to being the one serving them all those 'Mediscare' ads. Because—guess what, Mr Acting Deputy President and those listening at home?—Mr Coper was also director of campaigns at GetUp, an organisation renowned for its dishonest campaigning, and the scratchy voice of Ed Coper, the crusader against disinformation, sounds identical to the voicemail recording of Ed Coper, the 'We love our hospitals' astroturfer. So Ed Coper, the crusader against disinformation, needs to set the record straight.</span>

                  </a>  A lot of coal donations went there. It seems fair to say that Populares was incubated at Olvera Advisors as a purpose-built campaign vehicle to assist teal candidates. Populares webpage lists its purported clients, but many are organisations like GetUp for whom Populares principals have worked in former roles. The Smart Energy Council is listed. In the lead-up to the recent election, the Smart Energy Council, which has Simon Holmes a Court as a board member, blatantly flouted charities laws by campaigning against coalition candidates.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ed Coper needs to answer some questions. He needs to answer questions about his involvement in this astroturfing campaign. We want to know also: Who was the client? Was it GetUp who ran a dishonest hospitals funding campaign against the coalition in 2016? Was it the Labor Party? Was it a union? Was it one of these so-called teal Independents before they decided to become a teal Independent? Was Populares working for this client at the same time as the teals? If it was, as seems likely, how does astroturfing sit with the noble aims of Coper's Center for Impact Communications and its status as a US section 501(c)(3) tax-exempt charitable organisation? The US has similar laws to Australia's regarding charities, and I'm going to be writing to the relevant authorities in the United States, bringing the actions of Mr Coper to their attention.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, if it was Mr Coper, the teals should justify their relationship with an astroturfer—particularly the member for Warringah, who seems to be especially sensitive about her relationship with Populares, given her so-called focus on truth in political advertising.</span>
