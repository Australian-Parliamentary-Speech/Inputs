                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:31</span>):  I was in continuance on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Streamlined Governance) Bill 2019 when we were previously discussing the bill. I'll remind the chamber as to where I was up to on this. We, along with the opposition, had contributed dissenting reports to the inquiry into this bill. The bill changes the appointments and terminations to the National Disability Insurance Agency, the NDIA board, and the Independent Advisory Council, the IAC, from one that requires unanimous support from the states and the territories to a process where the minister can override the states and appoint his own picks, thereby allowing the minister to potentially, if a minister was so minded, sack the board and the IAC. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said in August, there was a Senate inquiry into the bill. The evidence given to the hearing and the submissions overwhelmingly recommended against the package of the bill, due to their concerns about the ability of the government to influence the independence of the NDIS, which is very important. The government has not consulted with any disabled people or their representative peak organisations in writing this bill, meaning that their first formal ability to have a say on this bill was through the committee process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard from the disability community and their peak organisations that there was overwhelming opposition to the inquiry. Nothing substantive has changed about this bill from the inquiry and the deeply overwhelming and concerning provisions remain, and the sector continue to express their concern. We are strongly opposed to the passage of this bill, and we implore people to listen to the evidence from disabled persons and from their peak organisations, who are saying, 'This is not the way to go.' We're also urging the crossbench to support the wishes of the disability community, who are so clearly working to improve and want to see the NDIA be as strong and as effective as possible. That is the background. I thought that I needed to go back over some of those issues, since it's a while since we debated this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The board has been filled largely with former corporate CEOs from the banking and finance sector, people who are good at looking at balancing the budget but don't necessarily have experience in what is necessary to improve the lives of people, particularly disabled persons, in our community. It is absolutely essential that disabled people and people with that lived experience are on the board, for a start, but people need to be assured that the board is making, and has the experience to make, the best possible decisions for the NDIA. I think it's fair to say that, to date, people aren't confident that the NDIA or the NDIS are delivering. My colleague Senator Steele-John has pointed that out extensively not just in this debate but in other forums and in other debates in this chamber. An example of this is the past CEO, Robert De Luca, who was the CEO of the NDIA until earlier this year. He was previously the CEO of Bankwest, which doesn't have much relevance to disability. I'm not for one minute saying that Mr De Luca wasn't very mindful and understanding of disability, but the fact is he didn't come from that sector and he didn't have lived experience to take to the position of CEO of the NDIA.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is making and has made decisions that, in our opinion, have undermined the NDIS. There are not enough staff. Staff numbers have been capped. Even though the Productivity Commission recommended that the scheme needed at least 10,000 staff, the cap was put in place. That was a mistake, because this is a massive scheme and we needed to get it right from the start. Unfortunately, we haven't got it right from the start. We've heard overwhelming criticism of the NDIS. We've seen that people have not been getting packages, that people have been getting inappropriate plans, that people are still not able to access their plans, that people are waiting for months and months to get a package and that there have been awful situations where people have passed away before they got a package. We've seen inadequate training. Planners are asking participants inappropriate questions about their disability because they simply don't understand. They're making really bad calls. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can never understand and will never understand why participants are not able to have a look at their plans when they are in draft so they can consider them and provide feedback. The answer to one of my questions in estimates, not that long ago, when I was asking about participants being able to see their draft plans and not be forced to sign off on them without seeing them properly was: 'We could turn the laptop around during the consultation process.' For crying out loud! It is ridiculous, plain ridiculous, that some of those fundamental things are not being done. While there are moves to improve the training, it is still inadequate. When you've got people who are asking and are continuing to ask—we've had feedback not long ago, haven't we, Senator Steele-John?—</span>

                    </a>  about people being asked inappropriate questions in their sessions around their plans. That shows quite clearly that planners still do not have a fundamental understanding of some of the disabilities that they are dealing with. There aren't enough services in regional areas. People can't access the services that they've been funded to get, because they don't exist yet or they just don't exist. I think I've told the chamber before of the example of transport in a plan with people being told they could catch public transport in regional areas where public transport simply does not exist.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is the inability to use services properly. There is a massive bottleneck of services, meaning that some participants can't utilise their plans properly, which leads to extra money in their plans, which usually leads to a review where participants' plans are cut because they didn't spend it. I cannot tell you how many times I have had people complain to my office—and I'm certain Senator Steele-John has exactly the same occurrences—about not being able to access the services they need, because they're not available, because we still haven't got an adequately trained-up workforce in the numbers needed for people to be able to access the services, so they can't spend their packages. So what is the decision? 'Oh, clearly you don't need that level of funding,' so their next plan is cut. The IT systems are not fit for purpose. The IT system was not fit for purpose from the get-go. It was borrowed from Centrelink and is so confusing that service providers have trouble with it, let alone disabled people who are trying to use the system to access their funding. The government are literally balancing their budget on the fact that there is underspend to the tune of at least $6.4 billion in the NDIS. This is money that the participants haven't been able to spend, because the system isn't working properly.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to see more disabled people on the board of the NDIS, people with a lived experience who understand the complex nature of disability and who are committed to doing whatever it takes to ensure that every single participant has a positive experience, enabling them to access all the supports and services they need to live a good life. We understand that the current governance frameworks have created issues in the process of efficient and effective decision-making and acknowledge that the motivation of this bill is to remedy this. We support in principle the proposed consultation time line for certain decisions and actions: 28 days for initial response, with the possibility of an extension of 90 days upon request. We note, however, that the consultation process with states and territories on matters which require agreement proposed in the bill are already administrative arrangements for intergovernmental consultation. The COAG Reform Council agreed to a 28-day consultation period in November 2017, which would see the Commonwealth seek agreement with the states and territories. Once this period has elapsed, failure to respond would be taken as agreement. Further, the intergovernmental agreement between the Commonwealth, states and territories, with the exception of Western Australia, now captures this process.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've already articulated some of the issues about the appointment to the NDIA board and to the IAC. We don't support their proposed amendments for seeking agreement on the appointments and terminations of NDIA board members and members of the IAC. This bill is flawed. We have clearly articulated our opposition. We urgently need to see reforms to the NDIS. We need to have a board that has a wealth of lived experience and that disabled people are there making decisions over the scheme that was intended to give them choice over their services, improve their lives and give them a much better quality of life. The NDIS isn't doing that. We strongly support— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:43</span>):  I rise to speak on this important bill, the National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Streamlined Governance) Bill 2019. This legislation amends the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013 governance arrangements between the Commonwealth and states and territories regarding rule-making and decision-making under the NDIS Act. I'm pleased to see the government's amendment to the bill to ensure that the disability royal commission has the power to access information and data from the National Disability Insurance Agency and the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission. Labor is seeking a further amendment to defer consideration of the bill until after the findings and recommendations of the current review of the NDIS are publicly released.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 12 August 2019, the government announced a review of the NDIS Act undertaken by David Tune AO, PSM. The Tune review is due to report at the end of 2019, with scope to consider governance arrangements through the terms of reference. These include opportunities to amend the NDIS Act to remove process impediments and increase the efficiency of the scheme's administration, implement a new NDIS participant service guarantee and any other matter relevant to the general operation of the NDIS Act in supporting positive participant and provider experiences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill was referred to the Senate Community Affairs Committee, and a public hearing was held on 30 August. Disability groups that appeared at the public hearing on 30 August had the opportunity to provide feedback on the bill. They raised concerns the proposed consultation requirements would undermine the equal partnership of the Commonwealth, states and territories underpinning the NDIS. They also said that characterisation of states and territories as host jurisdictions in the bill misrepresents and underestimates the role of the jurisdictions under the current full-scheme arrangement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Disability advocates also objected to the timing of the bill in relation to the Tune review, recommending that any governance changes should be postponed until the review is complete. If the government is serious about the current review, it should wait until the Tune review is complete before this bill is passed. The NDIS Act and rules should be considered alongside any findings that may impact governance arrangements and the broader policy context. This cavalier and ad hoc response to NDIS policy has resulted in people falling through the cracks as the NDIS is rolled out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has ripped $4.6 billion out of the system, leaving people with disability and those who care for them without the support they need, all so they can prop up their budget, and it is at the expense of Australians with disability and their families and carers. We've seen examples of this—the wheelchair-bound man who was told he wasn't disabled enough and the woman with spinal muscular atrophy who had to run a GoFundMe campaign so she could transport herself to university. There are also those people who are impacted by the coalition's cuts and maladministration who are out of sight and out of mind. There are families and children living in remote communities in the Northern Territory who, despite severe levels of disability and chronic need, have not been able to draw down one cent of their package. There is little to no assistance given to people in these circumstances to access their packages—who they need to call and how to organise the services they so desperately need. In many cases there is simply no service provider available.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The complexity, restrictions and bureaucracy around NDIS policies are excluding some of the most severely disadvantaged people from accessing the scheme. Managing the process online is a barrier to many in remote areas where digital access isn't guaranteed. There is a severe lack of providers in the bush, and the burden of care often falls on family members and loved ones. Self-managing an NDIS package is far from a simple process. Add to this the issue, as I said, with digital access. I remind the Senate that English is a second or third language in the Northern Territory, where we have over 100 Aboriginal languages, entrenched poverty and communities where no-one with a NDIS package is drawing down. Grandmothers and mothers and aunties in remote Indigenous communities are caring for loved ones with a disability with no NDIS support because of the barriers to self-management. The restricted practices also don't take into account issues around culture and remoteness. They certainly don't take into account the impacts of entrenched poverty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a remote Northern Territory community, a child with cerebral palsy was sleeping on the concrete floor. They did not have a bed, not because their family didn't think the child deserved a comfortable place to sleep but because they could not afford to buy the bed frame and mattress. A child with cerebral palsy needs a bed to sleep in; every child needs a bed to sleep in. But the NDIS would not let the family purchase a bed under their package. The package remains underspent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A child who is PEG fed through a stomach tube was unable to claim their special formula through their NDIS package. This special formula is costly, and expensive to obtain out bush, and the family was finding it hugely challenging to meet the ongoing costs. A man with cerebral palsy was denied a $200 sunshade for his wheelchair. And the NDIS has no provision for cultural practices such as the use of traditional healers, or ngangkari healers. These healers often work side-by-side with traditional medical practitioners to improve outcomes for First Nations people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need cultural supports and brokers in remote communities to assist families and carers to self-manage their funds and to access their entitlements. This would not only assist those with disabilities living in remote regions; it would also result in local jobs in the bush. Come on! It's not hard. Meanwhile, the face of this federal government focuses on, and reflects, a meanness and a neglect when a child with cerebral palsy is sleeping on a concrete floor because his family couldn't afford a bed, which he would be and should be entitled to with his package. This shows how little regard this government has.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will continue to stand up for people with disability and their families by making sure they are in control of their plan through quicker, simpler and easier processes. The NDIS is one of the most important social initiatives that this nation has taken. At full rollout, the scheme will be allocating and be responsible for $22 billion. Labor believes this government should be taking action on the issues that have been identified already by disability services, advocates, other people and families, and of course by NDIS participants, who are living with this government's lack of will or ability to take serious action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear to everyone that the Tune review will impact on this bill, and we should wait on its findings. That is why Labor is amending this bill to defer further consideration until after the findings and recommendations of the Tune review.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:52</span>):  I rise to speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Streamlined Governance) Bill 2019. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue because, sadly, this government is failing vulnerable Australians with its handling of the rollout of the National Disability Insurance Scheme, the NDIS. And I don't say this as a political rebuke but as an accepted fact that we need to work from before we can make the system right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear that the system isn't working as it should. We know that it is difficult to access services under the NDIS. Every one of us in this place has had phone calls or visits to our offices from constituents, or has met people out at community events and heard from them about how the system is not meeting their needs. The NDIS is a great reform, but it must be done right. Sadly, we have people falling through the cracks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My fellow Tasmanians are not getting their fair share. While for some the NDIS provides packages of support to profoundly and severely impaired Tasmanians and helps them to have some control over their lives, many Tasmanians are still missing out. There are around 11,000 Tasmanians who are potentially eligible for the NDIS, and about 6,500 or so currently receiving funding packages. That means that thousands of Tasmanians are missing support that they're entitled to and that they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, I joined the shadow minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme, Bill Shorten, and the Tasmanian shadow minister for disability, Jo Siejka, in listening to NDIS participants and their families about their experiences of the scheme. We heard from a couple who came with their one-year-old child with cerebral palsy. Despite the clear immediate needs of the family, it took six months for their plan to be approved—six months!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of families talked about how exhausting it is providing round-the-clock care for their children, yet they're unable to get respite care approved as part of their plan because apparently it's a parent's job to parent—that's what they were told. So there's no respite care for them. Families also talked about the amount of work they do getting medical reports to justify their claims. Filling in the paperwork and collating the reports is practically a full-time job. In some cases, these reports were second-guessed by people not qualified in medicine and, in other cases, they weren't even read. Forum participants also spoke about the lack of supported accommodation in Tasmania. One parent who was able to find supported accommodation for her adult son had to take him out after two months because he was so severely and constantly bullied and assaulted by another resident. We also heard about lengthy delays in payments to service providers, even from approved services, and how the carers of participants had to chase the agency for payment. One local provider, it was reported, is owed close to $1 million by the agency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While these experiences are terrible, we've also seen NDIS participants die before they can receive the equipment that they need and that has been approved. From what we are told by the community, some participants are finding the process of registering or having a plan reviewed taking months and, even once people have registered and had their plans finally approved, participants are then continuing to wait far too long for the services. They are finding that there is simply too much red tape and bureaucracy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Participants visit their treating doctor or medical specialists, who then put in reports about whether a piece of equipment or therapy would be beneficial for the participant and should be put into the participant's plan. But the advice of these experts can be completely ignored and these items left out of plans. Decisions around what gets included in plans and what doesn't are inconsistent. A support which may be approved under one plan is rejected for another participant with the same or similar needs. And, of course, if the participant and the carer stand up and ask for the needed support to be put in the plan, as is their right, the plan is then reviewed, which causes further delays and ties up resources which should be used to deliver supports. It's not the job of the NDIS to tell participants, their carers and medical advisers that they are wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In other cases we find the services participants need are simply not available. For example, some towns in Tasmania have no disability taxis, meaning that scheme participants are not able to use this form of transport to access services, increase their mobility and, of course, reduce social isolation. In addition in Tasmania we've got the Tasmanian government hiding behind the creation of the NDIS, walking away from its promises and obligations to Tasmanians, particularly with regard to the funding of vital disability organisations. The NDIS was never designed to replace all state funded spending in the disability sector, and the Tasmanian government shouldn't be using the scheme as a way to shirk its responsibilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear that there are major issues with the NDIS at the moment, and it is clear that the government's management of the NDIS is dysfunctional. It is vitally important that we get this right. How we treat vulnerable people in our society is an indicator of the kind of society that we are and the kind of government that we have in place. Sadly, it seems that the government either has no idea what it's doing when rolling out the NDIS or, even worse, is deliberately implementing the scheme poorly. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know it's hard to believe, but the government appears to be deliberately short-changing Australians with disability, their carers and their families. The defining feature of the 2018-19 final budget outcome is a $4.6 billion underspend in the NDIS. We've also seen a projected underspend of $1.6 billion for the 2019-20 financial year. So it's apparent that the Liberals are propping up their budget by underspending on the NDIS while people living with disability are missing out on the care and support they need and deserve. Australians with a disability and their families all deserve better. The effect of this underspend is that individual NDIS participants are, on average, $20,000 worse off. Vulnerable people shouldn't be unfairly targeted to prop up the government's surplus. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, the government's management of the NDIS seems to be quite dysfunctional. The bill we are debating today is a good indication of the chaos and confusion defining this government's mishandling of the NDIS. This bill amends the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013 governance arrangements between the Commonwealth and the states and territories regarding rule making and decision-making under the NDIS Act. However, at the same time, the government's also conducting a full review of the NDIS Act and rules which has a focus on streamlining NDIS processes. In August, they announced a review of the NDIS Act to be undertaken by David Tune AO, PSM, commonly known as the Tune review, which is due to report at the end of 2019. So, while there is scope in the review to consider the NDIS governance arrangements that are subject to this bill, introducing the bill and holding the review at the same time seems to be completely ill thought out. If the government is serious about the current review, it should wait until the review is complete before this bill is introduced so that the NDIS Act and rules can be considered alongside any findings that may impact governance arrangements and the broader policy context. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, it seems that the government finds it easier to conduct a review than to act on the recommendations of reviews. There have been 20 reviews conducted into the NDIS—20. NDIS participants, their carers and their family members and NDIS providers have all told review after review after review the ways in which the NDIS can be improved. Instead of holding another review, the government just needs to act on the issues that have already been identified. Why isn't the government listening to those impacted the most? I know real action would be more welcome by participants, carers and service providers than yet another review. These are real, everyday Australians in need—not numbers on some balance sheet. It's people that are at the heart of the NDIS, and I often feel that the government misses this key point. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have really not ever taken the NDIS reform seriously and they've utterly failed in the management of the scheme in the six years that they've been in charge of it. As a third-term government, they should have already sorted out the issues, but they've failed, as minister after minister has neglected to give the NDIS the support that it needs. So far, those opposite have had six ministers responsible for the scheme—six. The current minister for the NDIS, Mr Stuart Robert, is continuing the mismanagement that he inherited. The NDIS is there to meet the needs of some of Australia's most vulnerable people. They deserve a government that treats their needs and concerns seriously and that acts to provide outcomes to people with disability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of the delays, 77,000 people are missing out on the NDIS. On average, people only use about 50 per cent of their first plan. In fact, I've met with constituents and, when we've gone through their plan, we've found that some of the services in the plan aren't needed or even wanted, and how they go about accessing the services hasn't been properly explained to them. People have to wait, on average, four months to get a plan, but many wait much longer. Then there is the staffing issue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS simply does not have enough staff. We need a workforce that is able to deliver services. In 2014, the Liberals put in a staffing cap, meaning there weren't enough workers, and there was a reliance—as we're very used to from those on the other side—on consultants and contractors. A staffing cap means longer waiting times and less access to services for those NDIS participants. There needs to be an increase in the number of staff to help clear the processing backlogs for the NDIS. In addition, we need to start planning for an increase in the delivery of services under the NDIS. As many as 90,000 extra NDIS workers will be needed over the next five years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's failure to plan for the future is really a whole-of-government issue. Their incompetence is not just limited to issues with the NDIS. Through the Liberals' maladministration and lack of leadership, people are falling through the cracks—as I said earlier—as the NDIS is rolled out. This is the consistent feedback of NDIS participants, providers and carers and even state and territory governments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The very poor implementation of this scheme is clear from the state of the agency responsible for its implementation. The National Disability Insurance Agency, the NDIA, was without a permanent CEO from April 2019 for a period of almost six months. For six months they didn't have a permanent CEO. It's seen a mass exodus of its senior leadership in the past few months. The agency also has a substantial lack of proper representation—and understaffing at the staff and board level—of lived experience of disability. To meet the needs of people with disability it's absolutely vital that their experiences are part of the decision-making and the strategic process. We can see that there is much improvement that can be made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill that we're debating today amends the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013 to change governance arrangements between the Commonwealth and states and territories regarding rule-making and decision-making under the NDIS Act. It creates a provision for a 28-day process for the Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme to consult with states and territories on appointments, other than the chair, to the board of the NDIA and NDIS Independent Advisory Council, the IAC. The bill also introduces a definition for 'host jurisdiction minister' and replaces the words 'state and territory' with 'host jurisdiction' in section 127.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has concerns with the bill as it stands. The bill was examined by a very quick inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, which had just three weeks to inquire into and report on the bill. I would like to thank the Labor members of the committee in particular for their additional comments, which have informed Labor's view on this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor does not support the introduction of the term 'host jurisdiction', because it fails to acknowledge the central role states and territories play in the governance of the NDIA and the important financial and policy contribution that they make to the scheme. Labor is also concerned that changing agreement requirements may have the effect of reducing the participation of states and territories in important governance decisions within the board and the advisory council.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor does not support the proposed amendment granting the Commonwealth minister the power to appoint board members without a majority agreement from the states and territories. We also do not support the proposed change which seeks to alter the requirement of the minister in seeking agreement on the appointment of a member to the IAC, from unanimous agreement to consultation only. Labor is also opposed to the proposed amendment which seeks to change the requirement of the minister, when seeking agreement on the termination of a member from the IAC, from unanimous agreement to consultation only. These reforms do not substantially improve the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor believes this government should be taking action on the issues that have been identified already. The government needs to resolve the issues of access to transport, employment and housing. They are issues that are impacting on NDIS participants every single day. In addition, the government needs to ensure the National Disability Strategy is appropriately resourced. I believe that Labor will have amendments to improve this bill, which I hope the crossbench can and do support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government likes to gloat about possibly delivering a budget surplus at the end of this financial year, but doing so by underspending on the NDIS is shameful. We know that for many it's difficult to access services under the NDIS. There are also some very good success stories in the NDIS, but under this government it's not working as it should and has left many vulnerable people without the services which should be their right. A government that thinks that ripping $4.6 billion away from providing services for people in need is one that has its priorities all wrong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will continue to stand up for people with disability and their carers and families by making sure they are in control of their plan through quicker, simpler and easier processes. This government is clearly not serious about taking action or about its new review. If it were, it would have recognised that the review would impact on this bill and it would have waited to ensure that any findings could be considered appropriately. The NDIS was a bold reform by Labor in the style of Medicare, superannuation and the minimum wage. The Liberals are deliberately underfunding the NDIS so they can prop up their budget position at the expense of Australians with disability and their families and carers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Budgets are the way to pay for services that people need. But, unfortunately, this government is unable to see the real people. It just sees numbers. That shows how little regard the Liberals have for people with disability and their families. But, unlike the Liberals, the Labor Party will stand up for people with disability and their families, carers and loved ones.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:10</span>):  The Greens have significant concerns about this legislation and do not support the National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Streamlined Governance) Bill 2019. This bill proposes to change the process of appointments and terminations to the National Disability Insurance Agency board and the Independent Advisory Council from one that requires unanimous support from the states and territories to a process where the minister can override states and territories and appoint his or her own picks. Basically, it's allowing the minister to stack the board of the National Disability Insurance Agency and the Independent Advisory Council.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the context of this concern held by the Greens, it's worth colleagues considering the rampant way that the government has, over the last two terms, stacked members, mates and failed LNP politicians into the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This government has a shameful track record of stacking people onto boards and into cushy appointments. I accept that the Labor Party, when it was in government, did the same at the AAT. However, this LNP government has taken it to an absolutely new level. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ministers in the current government simply cannot be trusted to make good appointments. They cannot be trusted to make appointments based on merit. But what they can be trusted to do is to look after their mates and to look after failed LNP politicians who have been appointed in recent years not just to the AAT but, for example, to administer territories and provinces of Australia. I want to be very clear: we are predicting, should this legislation pass, a stacking of the National Disability Insurance Agency, the NDIA, and the Independent Advisory Council. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As previous speakers have referenced, there was a Senate inquiry into this bill. The evidence given in the hearing and in the submissions overwhelmingly recommended against the passage of this legislation due to concerns about the ability of government to influence the independence of the NDIS. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has made an art form of not consulting with people with disabilities, and that's not only the case in the context of this current legislation but also the case in the way that the government has developed its draft legislation which is colloquially known as the religious freedom legislation. Religious freedom hasn't been broadly commented on in the media or in the public conversation, but the proposed legislation would have a significant impact on people with disability. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go a little bit into the detail about that, because I think it's important that senators understand how the draft legislation that the government is currently considering would impact on people with disability. Basically, what that draft legislation provides for is that a statement of belief will be largely exempt from federal, state and territory discrimination law, including the Commonwealth Disability Discrimination Act and also the Tasmanian Anti-Discrimination Act in my home state—might I add, the best anti-discrimination act in the country by a long way. As I said, a statement of belief will be largely exempt from antidiscrimination law, and the onus to prove that a statement of belief is not legitimate will fall largely on the person alleging that they have been discriminated against. So, for example, someone will be able to say, 'You're in a wheelchair because God's punishing you for sins in your past life,' and the onus of proof will fall on the person who is in the wheelchair and to whom that was said to prove that that statement of belief is not legitimate. It will make it harder for businesses, government agencies and non-government organisations to build workplaces that are inclusive for people with disabilities. Another example is that an employee of a business or a government agency could state that a colleague who's got mental health challenges has been possessed by the devil, a terribly discriminatory comment. But this government thinks that the onus should be on that person to show that that statement of belief was not reasonable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's got that piece of legislation completely wrong. It's important that everyone in this place and those around Australia who are interested in these issues, including the rights of people with disability, understand that, in fact, that legislation will impinge grossly on the rights of people with disability. It's worth pointing out, in the Tasmanian context, that overwhelmingly the largest number of complaints made to the Tasmanian Anti-Discrimination Commission have been made by people with disabilities. In some years, the total number of complaints made under the Tasmanian act by people with disabilities exceeds the combined total of complaints made on the basis of race and sexuality. That's how significant that particular reform is for people with disabilities, and it shows that this government is actually not serious about ensuring that people with disabilities are not discriminated against and it's not serious about delivering what is in the best interests of people with disabilities in other legislation, including this bill that we're debating today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During that Senate inquiry, as I said, the evidence and the submissions overwhelmingly recommended against the passage of this legislation. Labor and the Australian Greens both contributed dissenting reports to that inquiry. Nothing substantive has changed in this bill from the bill that was examined in the inquiry. The deeply concerning provisions in this legislation remain, and the sector representing people with disabilities continues to express its concern. As I said, the Greens are strongly opposed to the passage of this legislation. We implore the Labor Party to stick to their dissenting position following the Senate inquiry, and we really urge the crossbench to fall in behind the disability community and the peak bodies that represent people with disability and who are so avidly working to improve the NDIA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the broader context, this is a government obsessed with a budget surplus, and that is entirely driven by political considerations. In terms of public policy, that is a ludicrous position to take. Let's not forget that this is a government, a very conservative government, that believes a budget surplus must come before all else and that everything else will need to fall into line behind that ideologically driven desire for a budget surplus.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what should be in the government's mind that's far more important than delivering a budget surplus is the lived experience of people with disabilities. That lived experience should be crucial for the board of the National Disability Insurance Agency so that it can function in the best interests of disabled people, and yet this is not the case. The board has been largely filled with former corporate CEOs from the banking and finance sector—people who are great at balancing budgets, but they're not necessarily that good at actually improving the lives of people with disabilities in our community. One example is Mr De Luca, who was the CEO of the NDIA until earlier this year, and previously the CEO of Bankwest. I can't see the relevance there to the lived experience of people with disabilities. If the minister is able to educate me on that, I'd be very happy to accept the lesson.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government would never have brought in the NDIS. I acknowledge that it was introduced by the Australian Labor Party—in fact, it was one of the enduring reforms that were delivered during that politically contentious period of government. But it was a period of government that did deliver some good reform, and, in the view of the Australian Greens, the NDIS falls comfortably into that description. But this government—the current government—is already trying hard to break the NDIS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, there are not enough staff. They've capped staff at 3,300, even though the Productivity Commission—usually much beloved of right-wing governments in this country—recommended the scheme needed at least 10,000 staff. They're not providing adequate training: planners are asking participants inappropriate questions about their disability. That's not out of a desire to hurt or harm, but simply because they don't understand the situation for people with disability because they have not had adequate training.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are not enough services in regional areas and, in some cases, people can't access the services they've been funded to get because the services themselves actually don't exist yet. They have an IT system that's not fit for purpose. I'm advised that it was borrowed from Centrelink, and given the robo-debt scenario and the arcane and secret algorithms that have driven that terrible attempt at debt recovery, including in many cases people that never owed a debt in the first place, I personally wouldn't borrow any IT systems from Centrelink. I urge the government to reconsider that matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned earlier the ideological obsession with balancing the budget or delivering a surplus. This government is basically balancing their budget on the fact that there is an underspend to the tune of $4.6 billion already on the NDIS. This is money that participants haven't been able to spend, even though they're entitled to it, because the system is so badly broken.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the boards of the NDIS and associated agencies: what we need on these boards are actually people with the lived experience of having a disability. The whole NDIS framework is designed to be beneficial for people living with disability. It's not designed to be beneficial for the board members and it's not designed to be beneficial for the people working in it; it's designed to be beneficial and to improve the lives of people who live with a disability, and we're not going to get that to its maximum effect until we have people with lived experience of being disabled in positions of authority in those organisations. People who've got a lived experience of disability will understand the complex nature of disability and they will be committed to doing whatever is necessary to ensure that every single participant has a positive experience, enabling them to access the supports and services they need to live a good life. That's what this government should be focusing on.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Greens understand that the current governance arrangements have created issues in the delivery of services and the process of efficient and effective decision-making, and we acknowledge the motivation of this bill in seeking to remedy this. We support, in principle, the proposed consultation time frames for certain decisions and actions—28 days for an initial response, with the possibility of an extension of 90 days on request. We note, however, that the consultation process with states and territories on matters which require agreement proposed in the bill are already administrative arrangements for intergovernmental consultation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In regard to the amendments around appointments to the NDIA board and the IAC, as I indicated earlier, we do not support the proposed amendments to seeking agreement on the appointments and terminations of NDIA board members and members of the IAC. We do not support the proposed amendment to section 127(d), which would, as I said earlier, give the Commonwealth minister the power to appoint board members without a majority agreement from states and territories. We do not support the proposed amendment to section 147(2) to (3A), which seeks to change the requirements of the minister when seeking agreement on the appointment of a board member to the IAC from unanimous agreement to consultation only. We do not support the proposed amendment to section 155(3) and 155(4), which seeks to change the requirements of the minister when seeking agreement on the termination of a member of the IAC from unanimous agreement to consultation only.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's worth colleagues noting the submission of the Young People in Nursing Homes National Alliance. In my time in politics, particularly in Tasmania, I've visited a number of young people who are in supported accommodation, many of them in nursing homes, and I've heard directly from them about many of their concerns. The Young People in Nursing Homes National Alliance, in their submission to the inquiry, contended this:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the NDIS Board, its advisory structures and its relationships with all participating governments must have a direct line of sight to the variety of communities and cohorts the NDIS must interact with. The States and Territories knowledge of their communities and services is critical to the eventual national success of the NDIS and must be retained in the selection process of these bodies.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens absolutely agree with the sentiments in that submission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We support the views of disability organisations and we very strongly assert that appointments to and terminations from the NDIA board and the IAC must remain in a majority decision model. Board members and IAC members play significant roles in shaping the strategic direction of the NDIS and the way that it functions and operates, and both of those matters are of crucial importance. Therefore, it's the Greens' position that these decisions must follow a majority decision-making model and, in fact, a majority decision-making model will enhance the prospects of a good strategic direction and also enhance the prospects of good operational decisions, which are the things that matter in the day-to-day lives of people with disability. Therefore, it is our position that these decisions should be made by a majority decision-making model, in recognition of the fact that unanimous decisions are very difficult to achieve and can compromise the efficiency and effectiveness of the NDIS governance system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also had some concerns around the timing of this legislation in the context of current reviews looking into the NDIS Act and the National Disability Strategy. Time prevents me from going through all of those concerns, but I do want to place on the record that the majority committee report notes the concerns raised about the timing of this bill. Those concerns suggest that any legislative changes to the governance of the NDIS should be postponed until after the NDIS review being undertaken by Mr David Tune AO, PSM—that's the Tune review—and the review of the National Disability Strategy. The majority committee report also acknowledges there may be scope within the aforementioned reviews to consider issues with governance arrangements.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of the day, when we're considering anything in regard to the NDIS and its governance arrangements, we ought to keep one thing front and centre in our minds—that is, how do we best support people with disability? How do we best support them to live the good life that they deserve to lead?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  I rise to speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Streamlined Governance) Bill 2019, and let me be clear from the very outset: the Greens are strongly opposed to this bill. Before I say any more, could I also say how proud I am of Senator Steele-John for his absolute passion, his work, his activism and his advocacy in this area.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill changes the process of appointments to and terminations from the National Disability Insurance Agency board and the Independent Advisory Council. If this bill passes, the process of selecting the board will go from one that requires unanimous support from the states and territories to one where the minister can override the states and appoint his own picks. This bill allows the minister, in effect, to stack the board and the Independent Advisory Council and then replace them with their own hand-picked mates. Really, this is just another step in the corporatisation and centralisation of the board. We all know that the federal government funds the National Disability Insurance Scheme, but just because it does so does not mean that the states and territories are absolved of their responsibility to scrutinise the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The states and territories still have the responsibility towards their communities and their people.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In August there was a Senate inquiry into this bill, which the government has completely ignored. How disrespectful is that to the people who appeared before the inquiry and gave evidence as to why this bill is such a terrible idea? How disrespectful is it to all those people who made submissions? The evidence given in the hearing and in the submissions overwhelmingly recommended against the passage of this bill due to concerns about government influence and the independence of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The Greens want the National Disability Insurance Scheme to remain independent. Further, I think it is shameful that the government has not consulted with people with disability or their representative peak organisations in the drafting of this bill. How shameful and, again, disrespectful is that? It shows the government's contempt for the process and for the people who will be impacted by this bill every single day, every single hour, every single minute of their lives. We know that there is overwhelming opposition from the disability community and their peak organisations, which they have expressed throughout the inquiry into this bill. The government is just not listening.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor and the Greens both contributed dissenting reports to the inquiry. Nothing substantive has changed about this bill since the inquiry. The deeply concerning provisions remain, and the sector continues to express its concern. We are strongly opposed to the passage of this bill, and we implore the opposition to stick to its dissenting position from the inquiry. We also urge the crossbench to support the wishes of the disability community, who are working so avidly to improve the National Disability Insurance Agency.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Disability Insurance Agency board and the Independent Advisory Council should be just that—totally independent from the government—to allow them to always act in the best interests of the people with disability who are participating in the National Disability Insurance Scheme. I would like to quote from a submission made by Queenslanders with Disability Network. They say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">QDN notes that the proposed model of governance appears to be moving from a consensus model, where agreement among the States and Territories is sought before action is taken to a consultative model, where State and Territory governments (referred to in the legislation as Host Jurisdictions) are consulted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Regarding the proposed changes around appointment of Board Members, QDN believes a reasonable argument can be made that there should be more constraint around the appointment of Board members due to the need to ensure the Board and Independent Advisory Committee's (IAC) composition reflects contemporary NDIS governance issues as well as the different compositions of each State and Territory. Importantly, given the national nature of the Scheme, governance arrangements should allow for strategic feedback and direction that reflects the diversity of jurisdictions' geographical spread and topography and the particular NDIS key issues impacting each. In Queensland, for instance, getting 30,000 new participants into the Scheme is a key priority which has seen the bi-lateral agreement with the Commonwealth extended by 12 months. This has not been reflected in other jurisdictions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">QDN agrees that the NDIS needs significant reforms in its governance structure to address interface issues between the Commonwealth and States and Territories. Now that the NDIS has achieved full roll out and interface issues with State service systems is such a critical issue with our members and all people with disability, QDN believes the role of the States and Territories needs to be more central to the scheme. This requires an overall strategic approach that sees the States/ Territories as partners with the Commonwealth and ensures the Scheme has improved integration with other service systems. QDN believes a thorough review of governance arrangements could achieve this.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">QDN also say in their submission:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">QDN believes the IAC composition should reflect the broad skill set required to achieve effective Scheme governance, including representation of people with lived experience of disability and their families.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens believe that lived experience of disability should be crucial for the board of the National Disability Insurance Agency. I just can't understand how you cannot have that in a board that governs the NDIS. It is ridiculous, and it is going to have a negative impact on the people who the scheme is supposed to help. It is not in the best interests of people with disability to not have a board that reflects people who are with disability. Yet this is the case, and that's not good enough.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that is obsessed with so-called budget surpluses. This government is literally balancing its budget on the fact that there is an underspend to the tune of $4.6 billion already in the National Disability Insurance Scheme. This is money that participants haven't been able to spend, because the system is so broken. What a farce! The Young People in Nursing Homes National Alliance said in their submission:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… we believe this Streamlined Governance Bill is premature and should be deferred until the review of the <span style="font-style:italic;">NDIS Act</span> is complete, at which time the legislative provisions for efficient implementation become relevant.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know this government is already trying hard to break the National Disability Insurance Scheme. There are simply not enough staff to do the work necessary to run the scheme. They have capped staff at 3,300 even though the Productivity Commission recommended the scheme needs at least 10,000 staff. There is an ABC article that was published on 13 May 2019 that points out the complexities that people face in order to navigate the system, and I want to read out a few things from that because I think it's really important for us all to know that this bill is coming in the context of a system that is already struggling:</span>

People can't access the services they have been funded to get, because they just don't exist, so, rather than doing some work on improving those, this government here is bringing in this bill to remove the independence. There is also an inability to utilise services properly. There is a massive bottleneck of services, meaning some participants can't utilise their plans properly, which leads to extra money left in their plans, which usually leads to a review where participants' plans are cut because they didn't spend it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The IT system is not fit for purpose either. This was borrowed from Centrelink and is so confusing that even service providers are having trouble with it, let alone the very people that it is supposed to help: people with disability who are trying to use the system to access their funding. Yet the unspent funding is being cut through no fault of the people who got that funding but because of the fault of the system that isn't working for them.</span>

All people have a right to independence, self-determination and choice in their lives. Surely everyone in this chamber agrees with that, and if you do agree with that then you cannot support this really flawed and terrible bill.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Disability policy and law is a matter of human rights as well as individual health and wellbeing. We want to see more people with disability on the board of the National Disability Insurance Scheme—people who have lived experience, who understand the complex nature of disability and who are committed to doing whatever it takes to ensure that every single participant has a positive experience that actually enables them to access all the supports and services they need to live a good life. And those supports and services also need to be provided to everyone in the community who needs them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People with disability—we all know this—continue to fall through the cracks. People with disability continue to be locked out of the community. People with disability continue to be denied the same rights as other Australians. Failings of successive Labor and coalition governments have perpetuated this discrimination, often denying disabled people access to inclusive education, meaningful employment, adequate services and the support they need. It is an obligation on every single one of us who sit here and who sit in the other place to make sure that inclusive education, meaningful employment and adequate services are a bare minimum that people need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Disabled people are so often shut out of our communities through outdated, discriminatory planning regulations. We must do better. We have to do better. There is no other option. It is definitely time—way past time, I would say—to talk about disability differently. It is way beyond time to start actually hearing and listening to what people with disability are telling us. It's time to build our places and spaces differently. It's time to change attitudes and realise that we are all different and unique and that an inclusive society is a better society for everyone, and we have a responsibility to change those attitudes as well as anyone else. We must recognise that it is not enough to just deliver services for people. We must work with them to ensure that they are the right services. We see that decisions that profoundly shape the lives of disabled people are currently being made without their genuine involvement. How can we ever justify that? We can't, because there is no justification for that. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Disability Insurance Scheme has the potential to transform the lives of people with disability, their families and their carers, and that must be our top priority. Of course, to do this, the scheme needs to work. The scheme needs to deliver on its promises and the scheme needs to meet the needs of the people. The Greens are 100 per cent committed to creating a fully funded and adequately staffed NDIS that is transparent, consultative and accountable. To be able to do that, we need the board to be independent. We need to have reflected on the board the lived experience of people with disability. We don't need the board to be corporatised and centralised.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Disability Insurance Scheme should, of course, be fully funded. The services that need to be delivered to people who need them have to be delivered as a matter of priority. It has to be staffed appropriately. Staff need to have the appropriate training, which is not actually being provided at this point in time. We need to remove the unnecessary staffing caps, because we need those staff and those services in every corner of Australia.</span>

                    <a href="252157" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WALSH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:50</span>):  I also welcome the opportunity to speak about the National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Streamlined Governance) Bill 2019, because this bill screams that the government has its priorities completely wrong when it comes to the NDIS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are urgent problems for NDIS participants and their supporters, but instead of addressing those problems the government is holding yet another review. And then, with this bill, it is pre-empting the findings of that review. There have already been 20 reviews into the NDIS, and it's now time to get on and invest in solutions. With this latest strategy, the government is not even focusing on the most pressing problems in the NDIS but instead on the matters that are covered by this bill. So let's look at what this bill does and also at what it doesn't do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill seeks to change the process for the Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme to consult with state and territory governments around the appointment of board members to the NDIA and to the NDIS Independent Advisory Council, other than the chairs of those organisations. In effect, this bill means that agreement from only a majority of state and territory governments will be required for those appointments when, at the moment, agreement by all governments is required. That could have the effect of reducing the participation of the states and territories in the extremely important governance decisions in the NDIS. Today, states and territories are absolutely critical and crucial in the delivery of the NDIS, and that critical role is just not recognised in this bill. That's why Labor is not keen on the introduction of the term 'host jurisdiction' in place of 'state and territory', because that change appears completely unnecessary. It devalues the role of the states and territories and it does nothing to address the real problems faced by NDIS participants today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at what this bill doesn't do. What it doesn't do is to provide any help to get more services out to NDIS participants who are desperately in need of those services today. Today there are tens of thousands of participants, carers and service providers who are battling through severe levels of dysfunction in the way that the NDIS is administered, trying to get access to funds and access to services. Right now, the money is just not getting out to the people who need it. That is no surprise, given the government has underspent $4.6 billion on the NDIS—$4.6 billion! That is a lot of money. It's real money; it's real money that could have gone to participants and ensured that children weren't waiting for over a year to get a wheelchair. It should have gone to participants to make sure that they don't have to set up GoFundMe pages because they think that might be a quicker way of getting assistance than trying to navigate the NDIS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, the Prime Minister says that this underspend is because the NDIS is a demand based program and that there is just not the demand for the services. Well, that is complete and utter rubbish. It is completely ridiculous. It is not that there is less demand from Australians with disabilities; it's that they can't successfully navigate a system that has a whole lot of problems that bar them from accessing the services that they need. The demand is just not being met today, and there are far too many people who are having to go through hell and back to get access to the funds and services they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS is a great Labor initiative and we are proud of it, but it hasn't been implemented properly by this government. Let's take a look at the condition of the agency that is supposed to be administering the scheme. There is a real lack of representation and understanding of Australians with a lived experience of disability in the NDIA. A huge problem is the understaffing crisis, which is leading to longer wait times and less access to services because of the government's arbitrary and dangerous staffing cap. I do congratulate the disability activists and the Community and Public Sector Union for their advocacy in pushing the government to deal with this staffing cap and add 800 much-needed extra staff, but the NDIA remains chronically understaffed, and the government haven't removed the cap; they've just reset it. To top it all off, as we know, the NDIA was without a CEO for months, and it's seen an exodus of senior staff from its ranks. All of this is having a huge impact on the lives of the people who need assistance and services the most.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the government continues to turn a blind eye to the problems that are plaguing the NDIS today and tries to pretend that everything's fine and there's just no demand for the services, we are constantly hearing about the issues faced by those trying to get access, and everyone in this place is hearing these problems. I know that my office and the offices of my colleagues receive a nearly constant stream of requests for help from our constituents in dealing with the problems of the NDIS, but, through a lack of leadership, people are falling through the cracks as the rollout of the NDIS continues, and this is what we're hearing time and time again from those on the ground: the participants, the carers, the providers and the state and territory governments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The stories of people who are contacting our offices and the stories that are featured in the media are incredibly upsetting. Can you imagine being permanently disabled but having to come in every year and prove it? Can you imagine having to get multiple therapists to provide proof because someone decided that one therapist's proof wasn't quite enough? How would it make you feel to go through that every year, often getting a different NDIS plan depending on which NDIS planner you see? There is very little consistency in this scheme, and navigating the system is an absolute nightmare for participants. Families are often asked to provide reports, and then there's a delay, and then the planner they've been seeing at the agency changes, and the new planner wants new information. They want to see everything again, and they decide that you don't qualify. You are then forced to appeal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is really concerning is not only that the number of appeals is increasing but also that the number of families that have to engage a lawyer to help them navigate the system is increasing as well. You should not need to engage a lawyer to access the support that you need for your child with a disability or for yourself. You should not have to access a lawyer. And what about those NDIS participants who are trying to navigate the new arrangements for access to transport services? Taxi allowances in the NDIS are so inadequate that people are using them up within weeks, when they are meant to last for a whole year. If you live in the bush, this transport is really the difference between being able to get out and, as Mr Morrison likes to say, have a go or being stuck at home quietly by yourself, isolated and unable to get out and participate in the broader community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These failings in the government's rollout of the NDIS have real consequences for real people. They have real consequences in my own family. My nephew is an NDIS participant. Cenk is a beautiful, happy 15-year-old boy. Both his parents—my sister and her husband—are absolutely devoted to him. Cenk has autism and he is entirely non-verbal. In addition to that, he needs help with the basics of life, like showering, getting dressed and going to the toilet. His difficulties communicating can lead to very challenging behaviour. One minute he can be very sweet, content and happy and the next minute he can fly into a fit of frustration and rage. His parents do an absolutely amazing job, but they really need help. Cenk attends a specialist school, and that school is focused on his needs. But he may need to live with his parents throughout his adult years. His parents—my sister and her husband—need help, they need respite and they need qualified, skilled and consistent help at home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me tell you a little bit about my sister's experience in trying to navigate getting access to that support, because she has found the process of negotiating the NDIA absolutely disempowering. She herself is a qualified teacher of children with disabilities, and she has strong networks of families who are facing similar challenges. So she, you would imagine, would be very well placed to navigate the NDIA and to advocate on behalf of her son. But she has been absolutely overwhelmed by the hoops that you have to jump through to get help, the barriers that appear to be put in your way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first program provided to my nephew was completely inadequate. It left them without help, it left them frustrated and it left them completely overwhelmed. What they need most is respite and help at home—someone to meet my nephew at the bus and spend two hours with him before his parents get home from work, someone who might be able to let my sister and her husband get out of the house from time to time. The first program offered very little funding for respite. It did, to be fair, offer funding for other programs, but those programs were difficult for her to access. The money was tied to certain programs which she couldn't find anyone to deliver and programs which did not meet her core need of respite. Meanwhile, other families that she knew who had children with very similar needs were being allocated either much more help or, like my sister, not enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To the participants of this program the outcomes seem entirely unfair, entirely arbitrary and, in many cases, unreasonable. People trying to navigate the system are constantly worried about whether they're doing a good enough job. People find the NDIA process adversarial. They are made to feel like they are gaming the system when they are just trying to get assistance for themselves and for their family members. People are constantly worried about whether they're doing a good enough job advocating for themselves or advocating for the persons with disabilities that they're assisting to get help, whether they're saying the right things, whether they're providing the best information, whether they're navigating the system as best they can and, crucially, whether anyone is listening and whether they will be heard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Within all of this my sister decided to seek a new plan. Again, the process was absolutely frustrating and disempowering—again, frustrating and disempowering for a person who is very well qualified to navigate the system. Every time she goes to the NDIA she sees a new person and has to tell her whole story over and over again. As of just last month, the NDIA decided to more than double her core funding in recognition of Cenk's<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>significant disabilities and significant needs and in recognition of how little assistance she was already receiving. She's finally found a person who manages Cenk's routines and behaviours, and she does have the extra help that she needs. But let's be clear: it should not have to be that hard. Again, she's a qualified teacher of children with disabilities, advocating on behalf of her son. Imagine if you had to go through that to advocate on your own behalf. I think everyone here knows that I have barely scratched the surface when it comes to these problems with the administration and implementation of the NDIS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's determination to tear down the NDIS instead of building it up shows how little compassion this Liberal government has. Its approach to the NDIS is like so much of what this government does, like attacking the most vulnerable people in our community, attacking people on social security with mandatory drug tests, stigmatising and penalising Newstart recipients with restrictive cashless cards, telling pensioners that their pension is 'generous', and doubling down on the arbitrary, stressful and draconian robo-debt scheme. All this shows no heart and no compassion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that does not stand up for Australians with disability. It's a government that does not stand up for ordinary Australians, full stop. They won't stand up for you if your child has to wait for over a year to get a wheelchair. They won't stand up for you when you're told you're not disabled enough. They won't stand up for you if you think that starting a GoFundMe page is going to be quicker and more effective at getting the funding and support that you need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This whole process of navigating the NDIS needs to be quicker. It needs to be easier. It needs to be simpler for participants to manage and take control of their own plans. Right now, today, what I hear from NDIS participants is that they have to learn a whole new language in order to be able to navigate the NDIS with any degree of success.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We really need to see staff levels increase in the NDIS to help clear the huge backlogs of people who are waiting for help. It is fantastic that advocates have been successful in raising the government's staffing cap. But let's be clear: more staff are needed. The government have just moved the staffing cap; they haven't abolished it, and they need to abolish it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most of all we need to make sure that the NDIS is properly resourced. With all of these problems that we are all hearing about, there can be no more convenient underspends on the NDIS—in the order of $4.6 billion—just in order to prop up the government's budget bottom line. There is already a huge list of issues that have been identified with the NDIS, and really what we all need to see is the government getting on and fixing those problems. We don't need a review that the government obviously isn't serious about, and we don't need this bill. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government were serious about the NDIS, it would focus on the real issues that are facing participants today. Unlike this government, Labor will always stand up for Australians with a disability, their families and loved ones. We conceived and established the NDIS. We can imagine the future that it could have. We can still see the hope that it offers so many Australians, and so we will continue to tell their stories in this place and expose the government's neglect of the NDIS and its participants. We will keep fighting for the participants of the NDIS.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WHISH-WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:10</span>):  I rise to speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Streamlined Governance) Bill 2019. I'd like to state this up-front, to acknowledge and thank my colleague Senator Jordon Steele-John for how passionate and strong an advocate he has been for disability in this country. I'm very proud to be in the same party room as Senator Steele-John.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll start by being really clear that the Greens don't support this bill. This bill changes the process of appointments and terminations to the National Disability Insurance Agency, the NDIA, board and the NDIS Independent Advisory Council, the NDIS IAC, from one that requires unanimous support from the states and territories to a process where the minister can override the states and appoint his or her own picks—in other words, thereby allowing the minister to stack the board and the IAC. This has been the subject of an ongoing Senate inquiry. The evidence given in hearings and in submissions has overwhelmingly recommended against the passage of this bill, due primarily to the concerns about the ability of the government to influence the independence of the NDIS and how the NDIS operates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At this point, I would also like to acknowledge that the committee came to Tasmania recently and there were a number of hearings—the joint parliamentary committee came to Tasmania recently and looked at disability services. The issue was raised about a Tasmania man, Tim Rubenach, and it's a heartbreaking story. I know Tim's family in Tasmania, and Tim's sister, Hannah, was deputy mayor of Break O'Day Council in north-eastern Tasmania. Tim died a tragic death in May 2018, ultimately from pneumonia, but his family described the process that they went through with the NDIS as a form of abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tim contracted bacterial meningitis when he was a baby and he suffered a whole life of severe epilepsy. As a point of interest, his sister, Hannah, campaigned for many years for the use of medicinal cannabis for her brother. In fact, she even grew the cannabis herself and made the oil herself. She wrote to the police, letting them know what she was doing and where the cannabis was. I'm just making very clear that she was a very public campaigner because she saw the importance of medicinal cannabis and its application to her brother Tim, and how it helped with his epilepsy. The police didn't arrest her. In fact, they said: 'For now, you're fine. We understand the application.' I actually looked at both of those letters. I just think it's an important side thing about Hannah, who campaigned for so many years to try to help her brother.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, Tim's mother, Beverly Rubenach, was very clear that the delivery of the bed that was approved by the NDIS for her son was delayed for many months. In the end, it didn't arrive in time. Indeed, the bed was delivered on the Friday but they buried their son on the Saturday. They had to take him to Launceston General Hospital where a special bed was made for their son. It was highly traumatic for the whole family. Tim died ultimately of bleeding stomach ulcers, and the tilting bed that he needed for many months just wasn't delivered. A whole series of mistakes and errors were made, and, of course, apologies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a really good case study of how the NDIS wasn't working for those who needed it, and there are a whole range of processes that are being looked at as to why these failings occurred, but, in the end, what that family had to endure was torture. It was simply not good enough. They have recently spoken, only a couple of weeks ago, about the state of disability services in Australia. Indeed, they called for a specific inquiry, nearly two years ago, into Tim's death and how the NDIS had failed them. At least they've been able to have their say now publicly in the inquiry, and I'm proud to also be putting this on <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> today. But many of the issues that have been raised in relation to this legislation go to the failings in the NDIS, and that is actually listening to the people on the ground and what they need and those disabled people who need the services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government hasn't consulted with any disabled people or the representative peak organisations in writing this bill. They have heard from the disability community and their peak organisations throughout the inquiry, and there was overwhelming opposition to the passing of this legislation. Both Labor, as has just been expressed, and the Greens have contributed dissenting reports to this inquiry. Nothing substantive has changed about this bill following that inquiry and all the evidence that was heard. The deeply concerning provisions remain, and the sector continue to express their concern.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Steele-John has so eloquently put in his speech, as have a number of my colleagues: we are strongly opposed to the passage of this bill and we implore the opposition to stick to their dissenting position. Having listened to their contributions this morning, I imagine that they will do so. We urge the other members of the crossbench to support the wishes of the disability community, who are so avidly working to approve the NDIA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is it? Is it privatisation? Is it continued outsourcing and privatisation? Is it penny pinching? Where's the obsession with wanting to run a budget surplus coming from, and how is that impacting what we do in this place? This is giving the government the ability to stack the board of the NDIA with their corporate mates. There have been a number of appointments that have been raised in regard to this. This is the key point: the NDIA board and the Independent Advisory Council should be just that, independent, totally independent from the government to allow them to act in the best interests of disabled people who are participating in the NDIS. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lived experience of disability should be crucial for the board of the National Disability Insurance Agency to function in the best interests of disabled people, yet the evidence shows throughout the inquiry this is not the case. The board has been largely filled with former corporate CEOs from the banking and financial sector. It may be perfectly valid that these people are good at managing financial agencies—they're good at balancing budgets—but that doesn't mean they are the right qualified individuals for improving the lives of disabled people in our community. An example, Robert De Luca, who was CEO of the NDIA until earlier this year, was previously the CEO of Bankwest. He may have been very good at his job at Bankwest, but there's not much relevance to disability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A couple of broader critical points have come out of the inquiry into the NDIS. There are not enough staff. Staff have been capped at 3,300, even though the Productivity Commission recommended the scheme needed at least 10,000 staff. The government could come out and say that the scheme is underspending and, therefore, they need to take away $4 billion plus to put somewhere else, but clearly the indications are that this scheme needs to be much better staffed than it already is. We've seen inadequate training. Planners are asking participants inappropriate questions, for example, about their disability, because they don't understand. There are not enough services in our regional areas, as can be taken from the very sad story of Tim Rubenach. People can't access the services they have been funded to get, because they don't exist yet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is the inability to utilise services properly. There is a massive bottleneck of services, meaning some participants can't utilise their plans properly, which leads to extra money in their plans. This usually leads to a review where participants' plans are cut because they didn't spend it. The IT system is not fit for purpose. This system was borrowed from Centrelink and is so confusing that service providers have trouble with it, let alone disabled people who are trying to use the system to access their funding. This government is literally looking to balance its overall budget on the fact that there is an underspend to the tune of $4.6 billion already in the NDIS. This is money that participants haven't been able to spend, because the system is fundamentally broken. We want more disabled people on the board of the NDIS—people with lived experience who understand the complex nature of disability and who are committed to doing whatever it takes to ensure that every single participant has a positive experience, enabling them to access all the supports and services they need to live a good life. I don't think anyone in this chamber would disagree with that proposition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I said a few months ago that I thought the biggest piece of legislation that we were going to pass in this parliament was tax cuts to Australians. This government have unashamedly rolled that out as their premier piece of legislation, the policy they took to the election. But let's not forget that over the forward estimates we have to come up with $180 billion to fund tax cuts. Primarily, and you can't dispute this fact, that will be for the benefit of wealthy Australians. The Greens didn't vote for these tax cuts, because we knew this would hamstring future governments. We knew that the thumbscrews were going to be tightened at some stage. Some of us who've been in this chamber for a few years remember the zombie budget cuts of 2013-14, which didn't end well for the Liberal-National government. We know what strategy is at play here: promise tax cuts to your mates and to your base and then find the money and move towards small government, which is very much the philosophy of the LNP. Where are we going to find $180 billion over the forward estimates? Well, here's $4.6 billion we can take away from the disability sector!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There would potentially be an argument in tough economic times if these tax cuts had actually helped Australians and had actually helped the economy, but all the evidence so far is that they haven't. If anything, they may have gone to paying off some people's mortgages and reducing mortgage stress, but there has been no evidence at all that it has flowed through to higher wages. There has been no evidence that it has flowed through to consumer spending. It has potentially increased investment in the housing market, but that is unproductive investment when we desperately need businesses to increase their investment in this nation going forward. The Greens, over this parliament and the next, are going to continually remind whoever is in government that we've had to come up with $180 billion to fund these tax cuts, which I think just about every economist in the country disagreed with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We understand that the current governance arrangements have created issues in the process of efficient and effective decision-making and acknowledge that the motivation of this bill is to remedy this. We support in principle the proposed consultation time lines for certain decisions and actions: 28 days for an initial response, with the possibility of an extension of 90 days upon request. We do note however that the consultation processes for states and territories on matters which require agreement proposed in the bill are already administrative arrangements for intergovernmental consultation. The COAG Reform Council agreed to a 28-day consultation period in November 2017, which would see the Commonwealth seek agreement from the states and territories. Once this period has elapsed, failure to respond would be taken as agreement. Further, the intergovernmental agreements between the Commonwealth, states and territories, with the exception of Western Australia, now capture this process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a number of other, broader issues with this bill. We have issues with the appointments to the NDIA board and the IAC, issues with 'host jurisdictions' and, of course, issues with the timing of this bill. The Greens don't support the proposed amendments for seeking an agreement on the appointments and determinations of NDIA board members and members of the IAC. We don't support the proposed amendment of section 127(4D), granting the Commonwealth minister the power to appoint board members without a majority agreement from the states and territories. We don't support the proposed amendment of section 147(2), which seeks to further change the requirements of the minister when seeking agreement on the appointment of a member to the IAC from 'unanimous agreement' to 'consultation' only. We don't support the proposed amendment of section 155(3), which seeks to change the requirements of the minister when seeking agreement on the termination of a member from the IAC from 'unanimous agreement' to 'consultation' only.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Young People in Nursing Homes National Alliance contended in their submission to the inquiry:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The NDIS board, its advisory structures and its relationships with all participating governments must have direct line of sight to the variety of communities and cohorts the NDIS must interact with. The States and Territories knowledge of their communities and their services is critical to the eventual national success of the NDIS and must be retained in the selection process for these bodies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens support the views of disability organisations and assert that appointments and terminations to the NDIA board and the IAC must remain in a majority-decision model. Board members and IAC members play a significant role in shaping the strategic direction of the NDIS and its functioning. Therefore, it is our position that these decisions follow a majority decision-making model in recognition of the fact that unanimous decisions are very difficult to achieve and can compromise the efficiency and effectiveness of the NDIS governance system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do not support the replacement of the term 'states and territories' with 'host jurisdictions'. All Australian states and territories are party to the intergovernmental agreement with the Commonwealth on the scheme. Changing this label serves only to confuse and convolute understanding. The Australian Federation of Disability Organisations highlighted this in its submission. This proposed change in language erodes the equal-partnership principle which acknowledges the integral role that both play in market stewardship, financial contribution and client-facing aspects, which fundamentally underpin the success of the NDIS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, in relation to issues with the timing of the bill, we are concerned about the timing in the context of current reviews looking at the NDIS Act and the National Disability Strategy. The majority committee report notes the concerns raised about the timing of this bill, which suggest that any legislative changes to the governance of the NDIS be postponed until the outcomes of the NDIS Act review being undertaken by David Tune—the Tune review—and the review of the National Disability Strategy are known. The majority committee report also acknowledges that there may be scope within the aforementioned reviews to consider issues with governance arrangements for the NDIS as raised in the inquiry but recommends that the bill proceed, notwithstanding the review. We do not agree with the recommendation of the majority committee report to proceed with this bill. The Australian Greens acknowledge concerns raised in evidence around the timing of this bill and recommend that, in a broader policy review context, any such changes to governance of the NDIS be considered in the context of any changes which emerge from these reviews.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, we do not support the passage of this bill. We are concerned that the amendments collectively diminish the role of the states and territories and grant the minister effective unilateral power in relation to hiring and firing members of the board and the IAC and making decisions about membership of the board and the IAC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I went to the very first meetings on the NDIS in Tasmania. I went to three of them in various parts of the state and met with stakeholders while the NDIS was being planned and rolled out in trial form in Tasmania under the Labor government back in 2012-2013. It's very sad to see that, seven years later, these concerns linger and that many of these issues haven't been ironed out. Indeed, the changes that we can see here are just going to add more complexity and more difficulty to achieving the original aims. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a significant reform, and Labor should rightly be proud of what they brought in when in government. I understand the amount of work Senate committees did on this before my time. The evidence they collected around the country over many years in many places through a very long, detailed and thorough process led to a very significant reform in this country. We have an opportunity to continue to improve that, not to take money out of it, not to stack the board with people who don't have experience in this area, not to continue down this road of outsourcing and privatisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a very strong role for government. This is a very significant piece of legislation and a very significant reform, and the Greens will continue to do what we have done under the leadership of Jordon Steele-John and advocate for the disability sector.</span>

Labor understands this inherently because, together with Australians with disability, their carers, their families and their advocates, we built the NDIS. We will always fight to ensure it's delivering on its promise to Australians. That's our commitment to Australians with disability, to their families, to their carers, to their advocates and to all of us who believe that the NDIS is fundamental to our values of fairness in Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government introduced this bill less than a month before announcing a full review of the NDIS Act and rules. The review will focus on streamlining NDIS processes and will have scope to consider the NDIS governance arrangements that are subject to this bill. This leaves us with questions about what it is they are trying to achieve here. Labor didn't support the idea of a further review when it was proposed, because the fact is there have already been 20 reviews into the NDIS conducted already. Isn't that enough? Labor believes that we actually need action on the issues that we already know exist within the NDIS, action that would also have been more than welcomed by participants, carers and service providers.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians with disability are sick of waiting for action. They are sick of waiting for support. They are sick of waiting for the NDIS to fulfil its promise to them and to all Australians. The government said they needed a review, and so here we are, but let's get real. If this government is serious about the current review that they had to have, then it should wait until the review is completed so that the NDIS Act and rules can be considered alongside any other findings that may impact on governance arrangements and the broader policy context—unless this is just another stunt by this government and they don't actually have a plan to consider the findings of the reviews they have announced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill amends the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013 to change governance arrangements between the Commonwealth and states and territories regarding rule making and decision-making under the act. It creates provisions for a 28-day process for the Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme to consult with states and territories on appointments to the board of the National Disability Insurance Agency and the NDIS Independent Advisory Council. Labor recognises that these arrangements have largely been happening administratively, but the substantial change in this bill is that appointment other than that of chair would be made with the agreement of the majority of the Commonwealth and host jurisdictions other than the Commonwealth in all states and territories, as applies now. Labor is concerned that changing agreement requirements may have the effect of reducing the participation of states and territories in important governance decisions within the board and the advisory council. This would be unfair, as the states and territories play a significant role in the implementation and allocation of the NDIA.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill introduces a definition for 'host jurisdiction minister' and replaces the words 'state and territory' with 'host jurisdiction' in section 127. Labor does not support the introduction of the term 'host jurisdiction', because it fails to acknowledge the central role states and territories play in the governance of the NDIA and the important financial and policy contributions that they make to the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals have ripped $4.6 billion out of the system through their underspend, leaving people with disability and those who care for them without the support that they need. They are underfunding the NDIS so they can prop up their budget position, and they are doing it at the expense of Australians with disabilities, their families, their carers and their advocates, and everyone working within the scheme. The effect of this underspend is that, on average, NDIS participants are $20,000 worse off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be very clear: it is because of the government's inaction that people are falling through the cracks as the NDIS is rolled out. This is the consistent feedback of NDIS participants, providers, carers and state and territory governments. It's the feedback we've heard at forums in South Australia. I've attended multiple such forums both prior to the election and after. It's the feedback we've heard from South Australian individuals like Jessica, who lives in Adelaide. Jessica and her five-year-old daughter, Ava, moved from Townsville to Adelaide two years ago, and since then they have not been provided with any new equipment from the NDIS. Jessica has said her daughter is in pain every day because she can't spend more than an hour in her chair. The paperwork for a chair took more than a year because they couldn't find a qualified therapist, and when they did they kept sending her paperwork back. All specifications needed to be justified, and some were rejected, such as having wheels which could be used on grass. After two years, Ava was still waiting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Beyond stories like Jessica's and Ava's, we have heard countless examples of the real-world impacts that the Liberals' cuts and neglect are having across the country, including families who can only get a response from the NDIA or the Liberals when they start a community campaign exposing the neglect, like Angus and his mum in Queensland, who relied on a wheelbarrow for transport on the family farm because he couldn't access a suitable wheelchair, or Kayla in Penrith, who had to start a GoFundMe page to get a car so she could get to and from university—a GoFundMe page when we have the NDIS! Tim in Tasmania tragically died while waiting for the NDIA to deliver vital medical equipment. A wheelchair-bound man with progressive spastic paraplegia was initially told he wasn't disabled enough. And there are countless people with disability who end up in hospital because they don't have suitable NDIS plans. There are inconsistent and inadequate transport arrangements. The cap on subsidies in Tasmania leaves people with a disability isolated. A woman from Adelaide, South Australia, who cares for a severely disabled sister said at a recent forum, 'I have $150,000 sitting here, but I can't pay anyone,' because she was unable to find providers and was told to join waiting lists with no end dates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In August this year, Labor's shadow minister for the NDIS, Mr Bill Shorten, visited the Gold Coast and met with Shannon Manning, a mother who is dealing with a lot on her plate. She has two children, seven-year-old Meadow and her younger brother, Madden, both of whom deal with severe disability. Like many parent carers, Shannon has injured herself due to her caring responsibilities. The experts have determined that she requires 24-hour support for a year just to deal with her own injuries, including respite once a week. But, despite these reports from experts and her own pleas, she's been constantly rejected by the NDIS. She's been told things like, 'Your daughter is not disabled enough,' and was even rejected for a new wheelchair for her daughter. Hearing Shannon say that she just wants to keep her children safe and give them every opportunity within the adversity of their disability was incredibly heartbreaking. This is what all children deserve regardless of their circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are just some examples. I'm not the first senator to walk in as part of this debate and bring tragic, tragic examples of where the NDIS is failing people. The speaker before me had them as well, and I'm sure the speakers after will bring even more examples of where the NDIS is letting Australians with disability down. All of these examples show that the Liberals are failing the people who depend on the NDIS and they are failing their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The poor implementation of this scheme is also clear from the state of the agency responsible for its implementation, which has seen a mass exodus of its senior leadership in the past months, a staffing cap that means longer waiting times and less access to services for NDIS participants, and a substantial lack of proper representation and understanding, at the staff and board level, of lived experience of disability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike the Liberals, the Labor Party will always stand up for people with disability and their families and loved ones. We want to make sure that people with disability and their families are in control of their plans, through quicker, simpler and easier processes. The government must increase the number of staff to clear the processing backlogs for the NDIS. They need to get to work on resolving the issues of access to transport, employment and housing, and they must ensure the National Disability Strategy is appropriately resourced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor believes the government should be taking action on the issues that have been identified already, the issues which are impacting on NDIS participants every single day. But clearly they are not serious about taking action or even about their own review, because if they were they would have recognised that the review would impact on this bill and they would have waited to ensure that any findings were considered appropriately.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has proposed today two second reading amendments to this bill. The first moved that the NDIA staffing cap be removed to allow the agency to properly and without restriction do its job for the Australians who depend on the NDIS and their families. The second amendment would defer consideration of the bill. As my colleagues and I have already outlined today, the Tune review, which is currently underway, has the scope to examine the area of the state and territory stake in government arrangements. The government should sufficiently consult all state and territory governments and disability advocates and allow the Tune review to report back on governance arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have said, unlike the Liberals, the Labor Party will stand up for people with disability, their families and their loved ones. We will expose the neglect and we will make sure that Australians with disability get the care and support that they deserve. We will continue to stand up for people with disability and their families by making sure that they are in control of their plans through quicker, simpler and easier processes. We will stand up for people with disability and their families by holding the Liberals to account to increase the number of staff to clear the processing backlogs for the NDIS. It is time to act on these issues of transport, employment and housing, and it's time to ensure the National Disability Strategy is adequately resourced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A staffing cap has been imposed on the NDIA by this government and the consequence is that the NDIA is not resourced to the level it needs to be to support Australians with disability. The staffing cap is forcing our disability scheme to breaking point and it must be removed. Labor built the NDIS, and it was our vision that the scheme would have a workforce of nearly 11,000 by this point in time. But instead the staffing level for direct employees has been artificially and arbitrarily capped at 4,000. How can these staff possibly do all of the work that is required? The cap needs to be removed completely, and the workforce really needs to be at the levels projected. But the Liberals' cap, which they first put into place in 2014, has denied the NDIA the human resources required to approve plans for people with disability and get vital equipment like wheelchairs, beds and hoists out to those who need them. It is time to remove this cap and to give the NDIA the opportunity to do its work with adequate resources. This has caused far too much dysfunction in the scheme and ultimately has had the impact of causing hurt for people with disability and those who love and care for them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just Labor calling for the government to remove this cap. We've heard these calls from disability advocates and the Productivity Commission. The cap has led to massive and costly outsourcing and an overreliance on temporary contractors, who aren't able to give people with disability continuous service. The NDIA has reported a massive increase in the use of consultants and contractors over the last two years. On top of this, the government have starved the NDIS of vital funds, overseen executive exodus at the agency and failed to appoint a CEO for nearly 170 days. The former CEO of the NDIA resigned on 30 April this year. It was the responsibility of the government to appoint a new chief executive officer to this position, but they failed to do so for 170 days. It was 170 days before they made the announcement of a new CEO. This speaks to their prioritising of the NDIA, an agency that hundreds of thousands of Australians and their families rely on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are rightly entitled to ask: Is 170 days a reasonable time period to leave a multibillion dollar organisation without a leader? Is it a reasonable period of time when the peak public body for Australians with disability is under crisis and riddled with stories of failure for Australians with disability and their families, their carers and their loved ones? It is not reasonable. It is not good enough. Australian families deserve better. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are not expecting the impossible from this government. We only expect that they care enough to do their jobs when it comes to serving these Australians. Enough is enough. The government needs to give the NDIS the care and attention it deserves. They need to show Australians with disability and their families and their carers the care and attention that they deserve. They can start by releasing pressure from the scheme, which is overwhelmed, and by scrapping the cap. Fixing the scheme will not be possible without doing this. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're told that more than 7,000 people working for the agency are employed through labour hire firms or local area coordinators. I get that these workers are doing a tough job. They're doing a tough job in a tough environment characterised by underspends and underresourcing. We know the impact of these staffing arrangements on people with disability, because inadequate staffing levels and insecure employment have led to high staff turnover, high workloads and a loss of expertise within the agency. As my colleagues have spoken about earlier today, we have seen staff put on rolling contracts. Of course, this results in less job security. It leads to high staff turnover. When that is the case, where is the continuity for participants within the scheme? All these issues tell us, absolutely and without doubt, that we do not need another review. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the issue of the underspend, this government has constantly stated that the NDIS is a demand driven package, and that is why there's been an underspend of $4.6 billion. But this isn't because the program is demand driven; it's because of bureaucratic delay. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian families are at breaking point, and there is not enough support or respite for families and carers within the NDIS packages. We have heard countless tragic stories of parents who just aren't coping. Day services are also under pressure. We've seen a quiet evacuation of services leaving the NDIS. There are still huge gaps for NDIS users who fall into hospital and, once they do, are no longer covered. They are told, 'This is a health issue.' It is unbelievable, but we have a government constantly defending their $4.6 billion underspend. Of course we'll have this underspend when so many Australian families are being denied the care and support they need and that was promised to them at the onset and implementation of the NDIS. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these issues tell us, absolutely and without doubt, that we do not need another review. South Australians with disability need action now. They need care, they need support and they need a system that works for them. They need to be heard. Labor, with advocates and with people with disability, built the NDIS, and we will always make sure and fight to ensure that it is working for Australians who need it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember the blood, sweat and tears that went into getting the NDIS into being: the tireless work of Australians with a disability, their families, their carers and their loved ones; the incredible work, passion and determination of advocates; the detailed and careful work done by Mr Bill Shorten into the design of the scheme; and, of course, the passion, determination and bravery of former Prime Minister Gillard in getting it over the line and getting it funded. People still tell us every day how much the NDIS matters to them and how much Labor's support mattered to them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This scheme is fundamentally important, but we must make sure it works better for Australians. We need to make sure it is delivering on its promise. We cannot do that if we don't get the implementation right. We should be under no illusions that the NDIS is working. It isn't working now. It's not working for the people who rely on it. It's not working for their carers. It's not working for the people who love them. It's not working for the staff within the scheme. That means it's not working for Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS speaks to some of our most fundamental values as a nation—our values of fairness, our values of caring for one another, our values of treating our fellow Australians with care, with dignity and with respect and our values of being there to support others in need. That is why we believe in the NDIS, that is why we built it and that is why we are determined to see Australians with disability given the care and the support that they need and that they were promised, because this is the Australian thing to do. But the government are not taking it seriously. They are not prioritising the people who need them. They are not prioritising the promises that we have made to Australians with disability. It is absolutely time the government undertook some serious work to get it fixed, and I assure you Labor senators on this side of the chamber will not rest until they do.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:50</span>):  I rise to speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Streamlined Governance) Bill 2019, and I echo the remarks of my colleagues so far. This bill wants to change how we appoint and terminate folk to the NDIA board and the Independent Advisory Council. It wants to change the process from one where unanimous support is required from the states and territories to a process where the minister can override the states and appoint his own picks. Of course, this will allow the minister to stack both the board and the IAC. We've got some amendments to fundamentally change that and to say that, no, of course we should be respecting the input of the states and territories and that, in fact, we would like a majority of the states and territories to agree with the proposed selection. But we'll see how we go on that amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has truly got form in picking jobs for its mates. The list of examples of that, particularly immediately prior to the last election, is longer than anybody's arm. Once again, we have a government that simply wants to tap its mates on the shoulder and slot them in and doesn't want any piece of legislation or this parliament or the states and territories to get in the way of its selection. I'll come back to the backgrounds of the sort of folk that it's chosen so far.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In August this year, we had an inquiry into this bill, and the evidence that was given in that hearing and in the submissions overwhelmingly recommended against passing this bill. The concerns, of course, were the ability of the government to influence the independence, or rather undermine the independence, of the NDIS. We usually have inquiries into bills to hear from experts, to hear from affected members of the community and to genuinely have a consultation process, but it seems that this was a 'tick and flick' exercise, because here we are, against all of the evidence given in that process, and this government just wants to put itself in charge and just wants to put one minister in charge of picking his mates to give them jobs. So I am sorry for all of the folk who took the time to participate in that Senate inquiry. I'm sorry that your views appear to have fallen on ears that are completely unreceptive to them. Yet here we are. This, of course, builds on the fact that the government has not consulted with any disabled people or their representative peak organisations in writing this bill—the same people it heard from through that inquiry, who, of course, overwhelmingly opposed this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to note one of those submitters in particular. The Young People in Nursing Homes National Alliance said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The NDIS board, its advisory structures and its relationships with all participating governments must have direct line of sight to the variety of communities and cohorts the NDIS must interact with. The States and Territories knowledge of their communities and their services is critical to the eventual national success of the NDIS and must be retained in the selection process for these bodies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We agree with the position of that organisation, the Young People in Nursing Homes National Alliance, and with a number of others that appointments—and terminations, for that matter—to the NDIA board must remain as a majority decision model, and it must not just be the minister deciding who's in his good books that day to give them a plum job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other point I want to make at this stage is that we have also proposed that the NDIA board have a legislated, mandated quota of 20 per cent of its membership being people with disability, and we want that quota to be achieved by 2021 at the latest. That should not be an unreasonable suggestion. This should not be a radical proposition that a body that is meant to be delivering services to people with disabilities actually have some people with lived experience in the decision-making roles. We have proposed that in our dissenting report. It's an issue that Senator Steele-John has a marvellous track record on, and I'm sure he will continue his advocacy in that regard. We will be continuing to push for people with lived experience to not just be consulted—the government didn't do that this time, and then they ignored them when they participated in the Senate inquiry process—but actually have direct input into the decision-making of this crucial body. We know that that 20 per cent figure would reflect the population of Australia who have disability. We think that for this crucial decision-making and strategic priority-setting body it makes perfect sense for there to be at least 20 per cent of the NDIA board legislated as mandated for people with a disability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned our dissenting report. The Labor Party also did a dissenting report into the inquiry, and nothing has changed in the bill since that inquiry, those dissenting reports or the views of the submitters. Those deeply concerning provisions remain and the sector continues to express its concern. We are strongly opposed to the passage of this bill and we implore the opposition to stick with their dissenting position following the inquiry. We note that they have some amendments, which we support, that I'll come to. We also urge the crossbench to please support the wishes and respect the lived experience of the disability community, who are so avidly working to improve the NDIA. I fear that the government has the numbers to ram this bill through, otherwise we wouldn't all be here talking about it right now, but I would urge at this very last minute for the crossbench to reconsider, to look at the evidence that was provided in that Senate inquiry process and to respect the experience of people who live with a disability, who deserve top-quality service and not just a minister's mate heading up a really important body.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just the minister's mates who are getting picked; it's the minister's mates in the corporate sector who are getting picked. You've probably heard the Greens talk before about the very cosy relationship between this government and the corporate sector. It is a very cosy relationship indeed. They scratch each other's backs. Plum jobs flow and political donations flow. Well, people have had it. They want their democracy back and they don't want this board to be used as a plaything and a toy for political favours for the corporate sector. If that is an incorrect assertion, I will stand corrected, but that is the perception of what is going on here. The government, if they want to avoid that perception, should drop this bill. The NDIA board should not be a province for the minister's corporate mates. I haven't checked whether they have made donations in the past, but considering there was $100 million of corporate donations to both sides of politics I'd hazard a guess that those very folk and their organisations have donated to the government and possibly also to the opposition in the past. I haven't checked those particular figures; I will go and do so. The key point here is that the NDIA board and the Independent Advisory Council should in fact be totally independent from the government to allow them to act in the best interests of disabled people who are participating in the NDIS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Coming to the board: it has already largely been filled with former corporate CEOs from the banking and finance sector. I'm sure they're very good at banking and finance, but do they have lived experience of disability? Do they have that connection to the community and to the advocacy bodies? No. The government is deliberately standing in the way of that happening with this bill. One particular example is Mr Robert De Luca, who was the CEO of the NDIA until earlier this year. He used to be the CEO of Bankwest. I don't know whether Bankwest really have much to do with disability service provision, but I would find that extremely unlikely. You need people with experience and, most importantly, you need people with lived experience to be in these crucial decision-making roles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is really doing its best, in our view, to break the NDIS. They have capped staff at 3,300, even though the Productivity Commission said it would need at least 10,000 staff. I acknowledge that we have an amendment from the opposition that would remove that cap. We will be supporting that amendment because there should not be a cap, and it certainly shouldn't be a cap that's one-third of what's actually required to properly administer the NDIS and to deliver the services that everyone in Australia should be entitled to rely upon. But it's not just the staff cap; there's also inadequate training. Planners are asking participants inappropriate questions about their disability simply because they don't understand, because they haven't had the appropriate training. This government has not taken the appropriate financial decisions to ensure that that's being delivered, and, not only that, there are also not enough services to go around, and that's particularly the case in rural and regional Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously I'm from Queensland and I'm going to share with the chamber some particular examples of where my office has sought to help people in regional areas, but far from remote situations, where they simply haven't been able to access services they've been funded to get, because those services don't exist yet. The first case of my office helping out was with a lady in Toowoomba. Her daughter, who is an adult now, had been housebound for three months—three months—because the NDIS wouldn't install ramps for her wheelchair. That was Linda and her grown-up daughter, Emma-Jane. She wrote, in great detail, to my office begging for help. We did what we could, and ultimately her ramp was installed. We are so relieved that that's the case, but she shouldn't have had to wait three months. Sadly, the examples don't stop there. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A lady in Toowoomba had been waiting for six months for a determination of the review of her NDIS plan. I want to read some of the email that she sent to my office seeking our help—and we certainly did provide the assistance we could to her. She wrote: 'I've been waiting six months for a determination of a review of my NDIS plan. I had a plan going, but as soon as my specialist placed quotes to request assistive technology equipment, the NDIS chose to put my plan into review. They promised me that I'd have my essential equipment, like my power chair, my shower chair, my hoist and my ramps, before the birth of my daughter, but instead of helping me they sent me to review five days after she was born. This was despite numerous emails from my OT and support coordinator detailing that my health was deteriorating.' Not to mention the fact that she'd just had a baby. 'I'd become so swollen that my skin split open and I got pressure sores from the inappropriate wheelchair cushions. I did the review at the Toowoomba office in August, as requested, and I was promised that I'd be reviewed within three or so weeks. They also told me that I should never have been reviewed in the first place and it was a mistake. They also made me redo my goals.' In February the following year she wrote: 'The review has not been completed. My support coordinator was told it had been sent on to the national review team before Christmas, but my health has deteriorated again in recent days, so I called them back at the Toowoomba office again. Yesterday they tried to tell me that I was not under review. Then another person decided that I was still under review and that nothing was approved. I was called by a senior officer from the Toowoomba office this morning to tell me that they are unreservedly sorry that I've been left under review for six months and that they'll fix it this coming week.' She goes on to say: 'The issue with this is twofold. Firstly, how did this happen? How could this be allowed to happen? And, secondly, they've told me that, because it's been too long, all of those quotes and the reports my specialist provided as to why my equipment is reasonable and necessary can no longer be used and must be resubmitted, so this means even further delays in getting approved. The new plan will be approved by those individual quotes, which will need to be singularly approved.' She goes on to say, 'This is just not good enough. My health is rapidly declining and I've been virtually housebound while waiting for the outcome'—I remind you that she's just had a baby—'I cannot keep living this way. What makes it worse is that the assistant minister to the minister told the office here that they must approve my AT in April last year. They disobeyed him. If the scheme is not answerable to the ministry then who are they answerable to? The scheme has major systematic failures.' That's the second example of a Queensland constituent who is already labouring under an underfunded NDIS. This bill does nothing to fix those problems and, moreover, continues the ability of picking mates to put them in charge of who sits at the top making these strategic decisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last comment that I want the chamber to be aware of is from another Queensland constituent of mine, who makes the point: 'Under the NDIS there is little to no support for mental health conditions when it is not a primary condition under which the person is covered. This is an incredible travesty, in particular, as to how it relates to LGBTIQ+ people who've already heightened risk of mental health conditions and suicide. I know that the current Medicare system is inadequate for providing sufficient and affordable mental health treatment at the best of times, but when this is compounded by disability the need for more support is significant.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are just a few examples of the real problems that people are facing that I hoped the government would actually listen to and start to fix, but instead $4.6 billion was cut from the NDIS in the budget. Because they were so desperate to win an election and to claim they were back in surplus, they are balancing the budget off the back of people with disability. They claim it's because there was an underspend when, in fact, these and so many other examples are due to delays, lack of services and the inability to use those services properly because of the huge bottleneck that's happened. That's not even to mention the fact that the IT system was borrowed from Centrelink. Gee, it's done so well there! There haven't been any problem with robo-debt there, have there, folks? So the IT system is compounding these other problems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've already talked about the fact that we need these systemic problems addressed and that we would like to see at least 20 per cent of people with lived experience with disability on the board, but I'll also now make just one final point. The majority committee report on this bill noted real concerns about the timing. The report said that legislative changes to the governance of this bill really should be postponed until the outcome of the review of the act which is being undertaken by Mr David Tune—it's known as the Tune review—and the review of the National Disability Strategy itself. It said the government should wait for that review to happen before making any legislative changes. That seems like a perfectly sensible suggestion to me, if you are reviewing not only the act but also the strategy. But here the government are trying to take away the input from states and territories and put the minister's mates in charge, probably with more links to the corporate sector because they made such generous donations to their re-election campaign. That's how things roll under the government. So not only are they moving ahead; they are actually moving ahead and not tackling the real issues that real people are raising with them about how this system is not working properly. Then they have the audacity to rip out $4.5 billion of funding from a program that was meant to be a real comfort and saviour to people. I hang my head in shame at the priorities of this government, as do so many other people around the nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay tribute in particular to the work of the disability organisations who participated in good faith in this Senate inquiry and expected to be heard and listened to and who haven't been, who've been ignored by this government, who don't have a legislative quota on the NDIA board and who, frankly, do amazing work every single day on scant resources, such as the Disability Advocacy Network in my home state of Queensland, who I met with, with Senator Steele-John. I also want to commend the patience of people who are living with disability and living under the NDIA scheme. You are trying your best to make it work, but bureaucratic hurdles are being put in your way because of the way the government have underfunded it and bungled the implementation and the rollout. I'm sorry, and thank you for your resilience. The parliament will try to fix this. Many of us in here do hear your concerns. They are valid and we will seek to act on them. But, at the minute, the government just haven't prioritised you, have they? Instead, they're prioritising the appointment process for the board. They want the minister to be able to put his mates in charge. They don't want to listen to the states and territories anymore. The states and territories can now give advice only. They can't have any input, just advice. This is just an apology on behalf of the Australian Greens that the government are so woefully underperforming in their duties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Coming back to this bill, I say to the government: for heaven's sake, wait for the Tune review. Have some people with lived experience on the NDIA board, would you? It's not a crazy suggestion. Actually, what a marvellous idea it would be to have informed policy and genuine independence by not having the minister able to pick his friends to sit on the board. So we don't support the passage of this bill. We don't support diminishing the role of the states and territories in the decision-making process. We don't support the minister having unilateral power in hiring and firing members of the board of a so-called independent committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will be supporting the amendments from the opposition about removing the staff cap; we think that's really important. I think there's an amendment about waiting for that Tune review; we support that as well. We have some of our own amendments that my colleague Senator Steele-John has flagged already, which go to the fact that the states and territories should still have input, and a majority input at that. With that, I again plead with the crossbench to please listen to the disability sector and to the lived experiences of people who are suffering under this system, and please don't rubber stamp this bill with whatever other side deal you've got going with the government. You should not be using people with disability as pawns. Please listen to their evidence and do not support the passage of this bill.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="I0T" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:10</span>):  Today I rise to make a contribution to this debate on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Streamlined Governance) Bill 2019—so-called 'streamlined'. The concerns of Labor senators in this chamber about the NDIS are significant. But, specifically in relation to this bill, the bill very much appears to be devaluing the role and decision-making powers of the states and territories.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I might remind this chamber that Western Australia took some time as to whether it would come to the party and sign up to the NDIS. It was reluctant, and for good reason, because it felt the accountability for communities of people with disability very acutely. It had to work through, with a great deal of trust, the existing operating systems for disability services in Western Australia to transfer them to this national scheme. We had a state based trial as well as a national trial to try and compare the types of services. There were attributes of the state based scheme that people very much wanted to hang on to, to make sure that they were properly adopted within the national scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While many promises were made in the actual rollout of the scheme, there are a great many and significant concerns about the way in which the scheme, in effect, operates on the ground in Western Australia. Things like local area coordinators—which are a feature of the NDIS, and in large part a feature of the NDIS because of the valuable role that they played historically in Western Australia—had their powers to do things like approve plans greatly diminished under the existing NDIS. We can't see the decision-making aspects of this legislation in relation to the board, in relation to the powers of the states to make appointments and for the time taken for the government to consult in absence of the very real issues on the ground for state governments, for service providers and, most importantly, for people with disability themselves and their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have sensible amendments to put forward to this chamber. This includes, importantly, deferring consideration of the bill until the findings and recommendations have been published from the review that's being undertaken at this time by Mr David Tune. Frankly, it seems ridiculous that this government should be seen to be wanting to race ahead with these kinds of governance changes while the substantive issues inside the NDIS, which might, in fact, affect governance, have not yet been announced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS should be a source of pride for members of the Labor Party, as it was for Labor in government, having created the scheme. I have noted Western Australia's reluctance to step into the scheme. Over time, it was very much about building the confidence that we would have an ongoing and reliable tax base as well as a sense that people's demand to get into the scheme would be based on need and not arbitrarily capped. The government says that this is a demand-driven system but, frankly, nothing could be further from the truth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was the idea of the NDIS being a demand-driven system that brought Western Australia to the table, because, while Western Australia had good disability services schemes, it involved a lot of bureaucracy and budget management, in terms of getting people into the scheme, when they clearly met the criteria to get into the state supported schemes. We really did want to see a universal, nationwide scheme that treated everyone fairly across the states, assessed someone's need for support fairly, assessed it in a timely way, adapted to changing needs and got those resources into the hands of individuals with disability, family members and community members that they trusted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is such a shame now that, some six years after the Liberal Party came into government, they have stuffed up again and again in terms of the rollout of the scheme. This Liberal-National government have deliberately underfunded the NDIS by $4.6 billion. It does prop up your budget position but at the expense of people having everyday dignity in their lives. You are propping up the budget position at the expense of Australians with disability and their families and carers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The effect of this underspend is incredible. It is terrible. We see the effects of it come in and out of our offices every day. I'm quite certain that the government will be seeing the effect of that underspend in and out of its offices every day as well and that hopefully it's also doing its best to advocate on behalf of constituents who are experiencing difficulties with the NDIS. But the government should turn those experiences into action by unclogging and uncapping the staffing levels and by unblocking the NDIS system so that it is a truly demand-driven system, which is absolutely not the case in terms of how the government is currently managing it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The consistent feedback of NDIS participants, providers, carers and, indeed, state and territory governments is that the system is not working. You've been without a CEO for nearly 170 days and with a mass exodus of leadership in past months. You've got a staffing cap that means longer waiting times and less access to services for NDIS participants. You've lifted the staffing cap from some 3,230 to 4,000. That is not a demand-driven system. Labor estimated a great deal more staff would be required at this point of the scheme's rollout. Very concerningly, there's a substantial lack of proper representation and understanding, at both a staff and board level, of people with lived experience of disability in our community. All of this means that the rubber has not hit the road on the NDIS in the way that it should have. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I highlighted before, my office has received inquiry after inquiry and plea after plea from people who are participating in the NDIS who have been absolutely dudded on their plans. There have been calls and correspondence from parents looking out for their children and having to fight just to get the funding and the plan that they had agreed to. I'll outline, for the chamber today, some of those examples. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One constituent has an adult son who's been in full-time care with severe brain injuries since he was a baby. He and his family are well used to dealing with the disability care system in Western Australia. Because of the significant nature of her son's disabilities, she didn't have a problem getting the funding that her son needed under the state system. But it was when they moved to the NDIS that their troubles began. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They found, in their planning meetings, that their contact person was difficult to get hold of, making the process take longer than it should have. Incredibly, they then gave her son someone else's plan. Things continued to drag on. When the actual results of the planning meeting came through it turned out that the funding had been cut by more than half of what they, as a family, had agreed to. This immediately meant that this man and his family were unable to access the day-to-day care and support that he had been used to receiving, profoundly impacting on his needs. I cannot underestimate in my plea to the chamber today what a significant impact this situation had in terms of the stress on him.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">His mother tried to reach out to the NDIS to get a review but she wasn't responded to for two months. She needed extra intervention to get her request looked at. I talked to service providers about how the system used to work and how local area coordinators were empowered in Western Australia in a way that they are not empowered to agree to changes in someone's plan. When you have a disability your needs can change quite profoundly and quite quickly. The idea that you have to wait months to get a review of your plan is simply not flexible enough to meet people's needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another family called on behalf of their small child who was born with a range of health issues, resulting in multiple therapy appointments to support her development. Moving to the NDIS meant the child's therapy hours were almost halved. They applied for a review, of course, as you would do, but they did not hear from the NDIS for a full five months before they were even granted a review meeting. For five months this child was not getting the therapy and the treatment she needed to stop her from losing progress during a critical stage in her development.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another whom my office has helped multiple times since 2018 is a mother in Perth's northern suburbs who has called continuously for better delivery on her son's plan. She engaged with the planning and following up. She put in huge efforts to keep the lines of communication open with the NDIS so that she and her son were not left in the dark during planning, between the start and end dates of that planning. Time and time again she would not hear from the agency and they would not take the time to properly communicate with her. I have seen the distress that the uncertainly of the scheme has caused this mother, and many other families, in it not being there to help and support her, her son and the stability of their family life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite might wonder what this possibly has to do with the administration and decision-making aspects of this bill, the so-called streamlined governance. I don't want to see the states disempowered in their advocacy around supporting families with disability. Canberra is a long way from Western Australia. I very much value the role of the minister for disability in Western Australia, the state government and all of the state disability service agencies in communicating with people with disability. They need to have an amplified voice at the table, not a reduced one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I, my office and my team are very happy to help families with the NDIS, and we will continue to do so. I really want to take the opportunity to thank my staff for their efforts. I also want to thank the staff of the NDIS. We're really fortunate to work with NDIS contacts in WA who do genuinely care about delivering for their clients. They genuinely care about improving the lives of people with disability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But should it really be the case that people are driven to talk to their local member of parliament about their NDIS plan time and time again? Absolutely not. Each time we hear these stories come through our office, we grow more and more concerned about the delivery of these services in our communities. I absolutely don't want to pin these issues on the ground staff, who I know are working really hard to roll out the NDIS in the governance framework and management systems that they've been given, but they absolutely are understaffed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of bringing this bill to the chamber, a much more effective thing to do would be to lift the staffing cap of the NDIS directly. At this point of the scheme, as I said before, we'd projected a workforce of some 11,000 staff. Instead, you've constricted the proper funding of the scheme with an arbitrary staffing cap. You have only 3,230 directly employed staff. Is it any wonder that people can't get their plans reviewed and amended in a timely way, let alone like we used to have in Western Australia, where your local area coordinator would absolutely be able to see immediately the need for a hoist because someone's circumstances had changed or the need for a therapy or a different intervention because of the change in circumstances and would quickly be able to support a family to make those changes?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our disability scheme is at breaking point because of the onerous staffing cap that you've put in place. It means the NDIA simply does not have the resources on the ground to approve plans or to get vital equipment like wheelchairs, beds and hoists out to people who need them. We continue to hear through my office the stories of, for example, people who have been unable to get basic things like wheelchairs approved. The cap is causing too much dysfunction in the scheme and ultimately is hurting people with disability and those that care for them and love them. I cannot overstate the high levels of distress and dysfunction that come when you don't get a chance to sign off and agree to what you'd planned for, managed for or worked very hard to negotiate with the NDIS. It can come back arbitrarily amended.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we've seen that groups ranging from disability advocates to the Productivity Commission very much also want to see abolition of this cap. We've seen costly outsourcing and an over-reliance on temporary contractors who can't give people with disability the continuation of service that they need. We've seen a recorded 600 per cent increase in consultants and contractors over two years, from $70 million in 2016 to $430 million in 2018. As other senators have highlighted to this chamber, we've seen important allegations of conflicts of interests in terms of lucrative outsourced contracts. The agency's own chair, Helen Nugent, was embroiled in these conflict of interest claims. We've seen, in effect, $4.6 billion ripped out of the NDIS. We've seen an executive exodus at the agency and a failure to appoint a CEO for some 168 days. The government has done enough harm to this vital scheme, and it is absolutely time to stop. But, reflecting on this, we see that, when we talk about this, the government characterises the NDIS as a demand-driven system. It simply isn't. The staffing cap is very much an application of it not being a demand-driven system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me highlight to you another way in which it is not a demand-driven system. I've been talking to service providers in Western Australia who have effectively had the rates that they can bill the NDIA for, for basic carer support— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:30</span>):  I rise to speak to the National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Streamlined Governance) Bill 2019. Frankly, we could talk forever about the misnomination of what these bills that the government are advancing actually do. It concerns me that we find ourselves in that situation here again with this poorly named bill, in light of the evidence that previous senators have put on the record and what is continuing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The hallmark of a society is how it treats its most vulnerable, and the NDIS is a concrete example of the goodwill and justice in the hearts of the Australian people. When Julia Gillard introduced the bill to fund the NDIS in 2013, Jenny Macklin rightly said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We know this is a reform that's time has come.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">A reform that will deliver significant benefits to people with disability, their carers and families and to the wider Australian community.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor created the NDIS, and we did it to ensure that every Australian with a disability would finally have security and dignity in their lives. I was very proud to be the member for Robertson in the green chamber at that time when those very erudite and accurate words were put on the public record.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS was a groundbreaking initiative by the previous Labor government. But, since the election of the coalition government in 2013, that government in its various iterations has done its absolute best to undermine this life-changing program. The Liberal-National government have left the NDIS in a state of permanent neglect. They have achieved this in a range of really disturbing ways. Australians going about their lives would be shocked at the way in which this government has capped, curtailed and contained what the NDIS was supposed to do. The capping of staff at less than a third of what the Productivity Commission recommended as required to do the job was a choice of the Liberal-National government.</span>

                    </a>  to you and to my husband, who I can't answer the call from! They have also continually underspent to prop up what they describe on the macro scale as their budget bottom line. They have left vulnerable Australians, in the course of that action, tangled in a nightmare of red tape and dysfunction. This reality cannot be allowed to continue. The horror stories of the NDIS under the watch of this government, now in its third term of office, cannot continue. There must be change. This poorly named 'streamlined governance' bill is wholly inadequate to the task.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a young boy with cerebral palsy in Tennant Creek who was forced into out-of-home care after the NDIA withdrew his funding. This is not a story from a time past; this is happening right now, in our time, on our collective watch as Australians under the failure of leadership and miserly containment of the NDIS that is characteristic of this government over the last six years. There's a young girl of seven in my duty electorate of Robertson, on the Central Coast, who was refused any NDIS plan despite a clear diagnosis of autism, leaving her without support for weeks and forcing her family, already trying to do the very best for their young daughter, to engage in a process of appeal. A young boy in Queensland had to be pushed around his family farm in a wheelbarrow because the NDIS delayed granting him a wheelchair, despite his mother spending hundreds of hours on the phone to the NDIS. In Minister Stuart Robert's own seat a mother, Shannon Manning, has been refused support for herself and her children again and again by the NDIS and was unable to even get a wheelchair for her daughter. These are the people that the NDIS should be looking after. These are the people that the NDIS should be supporting. These are the people that ordinary Australians around the country believe the government is supporting. But as soon as you start to look behind the veil of 'we support the NDIS' that we hear from those in the government you see failure after failure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the ongoing effort and hard work of my colleague in the other place, the shadow minister for the NDIS, Mr Bill Shorten, who has been doing what this government refuses to do. He has been out meeting families in forums across the country, hearing their stories and advocating for them, doing the work that should have been done by the department support and the agency support that should have been set up by this government. Six years of neglect is what Mr Shorten is trying to clean up. At one of these forums on the Central Coast, just last month, we heard from families who have had to borrow money from a lender to buy groceries to feed their family, because they needed to use the money that they would normally pay for groceries to pay for the reports necessary for their NDIS assessment for their child. I don't know about you, but I think most Australians would think that is a disgraceful thing to have happening in our time. The NDIS is about supporting people, not forcing families under huge financial pressure and subject to wage stagnation and job insecurity to spend their grocery money to comply with really arbitrary, difficult government processes that build a barrier between them and the NDIS that they richly deserve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor created the NDIS. We heard all the weasel words on the other side—'Yeah, we support it too'—but the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and this government is not delivering anything like the support that is required to make this program a national success and an international beacon of Australia's capacity to care for the most vulnerable. That is our first responsibility as human beings. It is absolutely our responsibility as legislators and leaders in this country to deliver the care that is required. Labor created the NDIS, and Labor will always protect it from Liberal and National party cuts and mismanagement. There are an estimated 460,000 people who will be using the NDIS at full rollout. This system needs to work, or the lives of those who receive it will be at risk. The families who support them as units are at risk. Indeed, we have heard, and it has been documented in the public space by the fourth estate, our colleagues in the media, that people have died as a consequence of the failure of the NDIS to provide them with their urgent needs. Implementing a scheme is not always easy, and teething problems can be expected in any major policy rollout, but they are made worse by chronic underfunding, by delays, by short-term management techniques and by the disingenuous action that I think characterises this government's response to the challenge of rolling out the NDIS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Critical to the NDIS is the work that the NDIA does in support of it, and the NDIS can only roll out properly when the NDIA has stable and dedicated leadership. The National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Streamlined Governance) Bill 2019, which is the subject of discussion here in the Senate today, amends the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013 to alter governance arrangements between the Commonwealth and the states and territories regarding rule-making and decision-making under the NDIS Act. It also mandates that any appointments to the NDIS Independent Advisory Council would be made with the agreement of the majority of jurisdictions—the Commonwealth and the host jurisdictions—rather than the Commonwealth and all states and territories, as applies now. Labor does not support the introduction of the term 'host jurisdictions', because it fails to acknowledge the central role that states and territories play in governance of the NDIA and the important financial and policy contribution they make to the scheme. I am concerned that the changing agreement requirements might reduce the participation of states and territories in important governance decisions with the board and the advisory council. This is about Australia. Everybody has to be invested in it, and certainly the states and territories have to be highly invested in it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill comes less than a month before the Liberals and Nationals announce the findings of a full review of the NDIS Act and rules, which will focus on streamlining the NDIS processes, with scope to consider the NDIS governance arrangements that are subject to this bill. There have now been 20 reviews already conducted into the NDIS. We don't have time for more reviews. There's no need for further review. Action must be taken by this government on the myriad of issues already identified in the system by participants, carers and service providers. If this government is genuinely serious about the current review, it should wait until the review is complete before this bill is passed so that the NDIS Act and rules can be considered alongside any findings that may impact governance arrangements and the broader policy context. This is why Labor will move an amendment to the motion for the second reading of this bill to defer further consideration until after the findings and recommendations. I support amending the motion in the terms that Labor will advance. If this amendment is not successful, Labor will be very concerned about any implications of the government's management of this bill in an ongoing way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill won't stop the farcical lack of leadership in the NDIA, where the coalition failed to instil a new CEO, leaving the agency leaderless for 170 days, and it comes on the heels of an exodus of senior executives, with four leaving in the space of seven days in July this year. When Labor left government in 2013, it left a healthy framework and a rollout plan. Instead, despite being six years into the rollout, the government is still unwilling to iron out access problems and has claimed the $4.6 billion underspend as a victory for their budget bottom line. So let's be clear about what's going on with the cases that I described in my opening remarks—the cases of families having to go and borrow money to be able to feed themselves so that they can pay for the reports to have their child considered eligible for the NDIS, and the delays, the interruptions and the appeals. That process has been so well rolled out by this government that it saved the government $4.6 billion, and they think that's good. I tell you what: the families that needed the money five years ago and still needed it a month ago don't think it's good, and I don't think they'll think it's great that that $4.6 billion, which could have been part of it and could have been helping them, is now being banked by this government and advertised all over the country as a great outcome. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="283585" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'SULLIVAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:45</span>):  We went into the 2019 election with a promise to the people of Australia that we would get more people into work. With a strong economy and a balanced budget we have continued to deliver on that promise. On this side of the chamber, we know that the best form of welfare is a job. Our commitment is providing Australians with opportunities to work, and this is unwavering. The Australian government's employment services program, delivered via jobactive, is the second-largest procurement of services to government outside of Defence, at a cost of over $7 billion. We have submarines, tanks and firefighter jets and then we have the employment services system that follows that—a sector solely focused on getting Australians, many of whom have significant barriers to employment, into work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jobactive has achieved some very positive results. It has achieved 1.5 million job placements from July 2015 to October 2019 and it continues to achieve around 1,000 job placements every single day. Across Australia there are 615,677 Australians on the jobactive case load as of 31 October 2019. This is a reduction of over 153,000 since the jobactive system was introduced in 2015 and a reduction of over 143,000 from the Job Services Australia case load when we came into government in 2013. There have been over 444,000 Indigenous Australians employed for longer than 26 weeks since the program started.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, with this, it's important to recognise that the sector is far from perfect. This significant investment should garner world-leading results, but it's evident that there's still room for improvement. The 2019-20 budget includes an investment of $249 million over five years to trial key aspects of the new employment services model and extend the existing jobactive model to June 2022. But there are further reforms required.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you are unemployed and require support, you need to go to Centrelink and register for Newstart. After registering, Centrelink will send you to an employment service provider, administered under jobactive, and the service provider will invariably enrol you in a training course that will increase your chances of securing employment. You'll be required to complete mutual obligation requirements, such as applying for 20 jobs per month and meeting regularly with a consultant working for the service provider. You'll continue to comply with your mutual obligations and then you'll continue to receive payments until employment is obtained. On the face of it, the system looks pretty good. You receive training to boost your chances in employment, you're consistently applying for job opportunities and you receive coaching by a consultant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to entering parliament I was chief operating officer of Generation One, an initiative founded by Andrew and Nicola Forrest to create employment for Indigenous Australians. Our program worked by turning the training and employment services system on its head. I discovered that the employment services sector actually wasn't quite living up to the investment that the taxpayer was pouring into it. It is significantly improved—I must stress that—under this Liberal-National government. It's certainly significantly better than the previous Job Services Australia system, which is well reported as being plagued with ineffectiveness, rorts and fraudulent behaviour. Jobactive is a darn sight better a system than Jobs Services Australia, but it can still be improved. You see, the training that jobseekers are required to complete is more often than not just training for training's sake, which doesn't necessarily prepare jobseekers for employment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have an issue in that, on average, jobactive consultants have a case load of 148 jobseekers. Couple this with the burden of excessive administration and you remove the consultant's ability to provide the level of personalisation that's necessary to get people into work. Then you've got the jobseeker's requirement to complete 20 job applications per month. Whilst critical in fulfilling the mutual obligation requirements that they have, this doesn't achieve what it was envisaged to do. Rather, it places a burden on employers, demoralises jobseekers and encourages a tick-and-flick approach. The flaw in this system is that it not only removes the personal responsibility of jobseekers but it's also incredibly frustrating for employers in inhibiting their ability to source quality employees. All of this happens while the taxpayer foots the bill, but Centrelink is satisfied that the right boxes are being ticked.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what do we do? Where do we go from here? We understand that delivering tailored support for jobseekers and employers will increase their chances of getting people into long-term employment. But, in order to take advantage of this model, we need to start investing in a platform that focuses more on data, integrated analytics, machine learning and greater collaboration and less on trivial training courses or application quotas. Prior to entering parliament last year, I was part of a team that delivered the <span style="font-style:italic;">I want to work</span> report to the Commonwealth government. This review was initiated by the Minister for Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business, Senator Cash. The government was looking for ways that the employment services system could be improved. On this side we understand that the system can be improved. The review addressed the current Australian employment services system and identified ways that the system could change into the future. To conduct the review, we consulted over 1,400 jobseekers, employers and service providers, and, with every consultation, meeting and submission, it was evident that personalisation through data and analytics, adjacent to existing providers, was key to a successful future platform. Analytics could provide insight into local industries, providing information such as current employment opportunities, local trends and popular qualifications getting other jobseekers into employment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must have a system that ensures every action a jobseeker takes leads them towards a meaningful and long-term employment outcome. We can use data to inform them of what does and doesn't work. We know that 90 per cent of jobseekers use the internet to find work. We also know that a significant portion of jobseekers can find work independent of the current system. In fact, 80 per cent of jobseekers were able to find a job on their own. These individuals have an idea of what they want to do and how to get there. They should be given the digital tools necessary to help them to gain meaningful employment. If we reduced the pressure of case loads currently placed on consultants, it would allow them to spend more time providing support to the people who need it most. The future of our employment services system should be one that empowers individuals by providing them with a user-friendly digital platform that increases their engagement with local employers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government has taken the critical first steps in implementing structural reform by trialling, under the new employment services trial, a new digital system for jobseekers in two locations across Australia. Included in this is a new system of mutual obligation. Rather than simply requiring jobseekers to complete 20 job applications per month, jobseekers will have a flexible and tailored employment plan, with compliance managed through a points based system. This is innovative and I believe it's going to make a significant difference in people's lives. But we've got to wait and see how these trials go. The result of these trials will be instrumental in determining the future of the employment services sector in Australia. Taxpayers are investing a significant amount into this system. Jobseekers are investing their time and energy in preparing themselves and getting themselves into work, and employers need a system that matches their needs, with people trained to their standards and qualifications so that they can be productive in the workplace. But I'm proud to be part of a government that understands the importance of the employment services sector, which at any point in time services over 650,000 Australians. We know what we need to do, and the time for reform is now.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="AW5" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KIM CARR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:55</span>):  Senators will be aware of the international concern at the invasion of northern Syria by Turkish forces. Among the critics of the Turkish action have been member states of NATO, Turkey's own allies. Senators will also have seen reports of the forthright comments about the NATO alliance by the President of France, Emmanuel Macron. In an interview with <span style="font-style:italic;">The Economist </span>magazine he described the alliance as 'brain dead'. That is hardly diplomatic language. Other NATO leaders, notably the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, have been quick to rebuke him, but the cat's out of the bag.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is reason to think that President Macron was saying publicly what other NATO officials and perhaps some other NATO heads of government have been saying privately for some time. Like him, they questioned whether the alliance can function if, as they claim, its leading member, the United States, is no longer a reliable ally. They cite the Trump administration's abandonment of the Kurdish militias in Syria and they cite the persistent belief that the Russian intelligence services have sought to manipulate elections in the United States and in European states. They also believe that President Trump is too close to President Putin of Russia. The German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, while rejecting the French President's criticism of NATO, has supported his call for a European security council as a prelude to a new European defence framework.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia, of course, is not a member of NATO. Our alliance with the US arises from different strategic concerns. But these rumblings within NATO raise issues that are also matters for us. Last month, Senator Fawcett and I attended a NATO parliamentary assembly in London as observers. The assembly was held as the alliance prepares itself for the celebration of its 70th anniversary, but for NATO the anniversary has also come at a time for reflection on whether the alliance still serves the purposes envisaged by its founders. Many of the speakers, both NATO officials and academics, in the sessions that I attended spoke of a new threat to democracy: specifically, the rise of populist nationalism in NATO countries. These populist movements have arisen and in some countries gained office at a time when the global power balance is shifting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">NATO faces a range of challenges. Arms control has broken down, and the most powerful states in the world—the United States, Russia, China and India—have ceased supporting multilateralism. President Trump's often-quoted statement that 'the future belongs to patriots, not globalists' has become a slogan for populist nationalists everywhere, and at the same time rapid technological change is both transforming the structures of industrial economies and providing new ways for states to intervene in each other's affairs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Climate change was given prominence throughout the proceedings of the assembly. It has transformed the Antarctic and opened up new issues with regard to resource exploitation and military deployment. All this poses serious problems for NATO, which has also presented itself with the great difficulty of how to deal with its stated claim of being the global champion of democracy. With a few early exceptions—there was Portugal under the Salazar dictatorship—NATO members have always been democracies. They've always sought to uphold human rights and the rule of law. They have sought to clearly contrast themselves in the past with the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union no longer exists and NATO has expanded right up to the borders of the Russian Federation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Russian Federation, the successor of the Soviet Union, is still seen as an antagonist, although not in the same way. As the discussion of the assemblies made clear, the most perplexing threat to democracy now comes from within NATO states themselves. Some NATO members, especially Hungary and Poland, have governments that are increasingly authoritarian. Yet they are not single party states; they are governments that have curtailed basic freedoms such as the freedom of the press and the rule of law.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These populist governments can be seen as expressions of the resurgence of reactionary nationalism within Europe. They whip up xenophobic fears about immigration and about ethnic minorities within their borders; their rhetoric is straight out of the 1930s. They're a threat to the ideals of liberal democracy, and they treat the principles of liberal democracy with contempt. Yet they are, of course, full members of NATO. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other countries seeking membership display similar characteristics. In those countries, corruption is rife. One of the contributors to NATO's debate, Celeste Wallander, wrote an article published last year, 'NATO’s Enemies Within', in the journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Foreign Affairs</span>. She wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">To the extent Russia promotes ideology, it is that same combination of intolerant nationalism, xenophobia, and illiberalism that is on the rise in Hungary, Poland, Turkey and elsewhere in Europe ... Unlike during the Cold War, NATO's illiberal weak links now align with the Kremlin's tactics. They are the alliance's Achilles heel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Populist nationalism is not only evident in Warsaw Pact countries like Hungary and Poland. It's also evident in the far Right movements in the long established NATO countries, such as the Alternative fur Deutschland, in Germany, the National Rally—formerly known as the National Front—in France and La Liga in Italy. We saw it in other parts; populism has driven Brexit's debate in Britain. There's more than a hint of it in the style of politics practised by President Trump. We've seen it in the belligerence of the Erdogan government in Turkey. Turkey's actions have angered NATO members not only because of the military incursions in Syria. They have known that Turkey has threatened to swell Europe's refugee crisis. Belgium delegates at the NATO assembly described this action as an action of an enemy and not of an ally. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Assembly delegates were keenly aware of the threats that populist nationalism posed to NATO's sense of collective purpose. They referred to it as 'democratic slippage' and 'democratic backsliding'. In terms of military capability alone, NATO remains superior to any potential external enemy. But military superiority can't resolve the internal challenges presented by reactionary, populist nationalism. So I'm sure that the view expressed by President Macron in his interview with <span style="font-style:italic;">The Economist</span> would not have surprised delegates to the assembly. His remarks were unusual only in that they were so prominent and that a European leader chose to make them in such a public way. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a lesson here for Australia. I believe that, beyond the obvious fact that there is a weakening of that institution that has been central to the world order for 70 years, populist nationalism should be of a concern to people in the country. The upheavals caused by populist nationalism in Europe should be of concern to us because of the toxic nationalism that also exists in this country. It has been shown as capable of influencing election outcomes, as we have seen in this country, and, as we know, its voices are heard in this chamber. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Populist movements in this country, like those in Europe, seek to manipulate the anxieties of people who believe that politics and the economy don't work for them. Populists rely on a fiction that they are not part of the political system. They seek to pose as outsiders and for outsiders. They incite hatred of minorities, who they portray as the source of all the nation's ills. They do not seek real change to the political and economic system. What they seek are, of course, opportunities to be able to advance their narrow political interests. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opportunities to participate in a conference such as the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, of course, was a privilege. In the run-up to NATO's 70th anniversary, the conference provided high-quality speakers and a high-quality dialogue amongst the politicians who participated. It was remarkable to witness the openness of the dialogue and the strength of opinions being expressed. Direct participation in conferences of this type, I think, is particularly important for members of this parliament. As our media has become increasingly and highly concentrated and hollowed out, the media coverage of world affairs has become extremely narrow. I think it's important for us to be able to get firsthand opportunities such as this. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw the recent statements in terms of our partnership agreement with NATO—principles that were outlined in the original statements set down in 2012—that Australia and NATO were dedicated to individual liberty, democracy, human rights and the rule of law, and that the partners re-affirm their original statements of adherence to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and that they are steadfast in their support for global peace and prosperity and a rules based international order. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the rhetoric has changed, these fundamental principles are now under serious challenge throughout the West, and the institutional arrangements that support them need to be defended, particularly through parliament. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:05</span>):  As we sit here today, we're on track for four to six degrees of global warming by the end of the century. To spell it out for citizens: that is the end of the human race. I want to speak about the breakdown of our climate, and I want to speak about the existential threat that our collective lack of action poses to humanity. I also want to respond to some of the tut-tutting that's emerged in this building over the last couple of days, because too many journalists, and too much of the commentariat in this place, have hidden behind the 'both sides' nonsense—that is, the false equivalence of balance—to condemn the Greens for telling the truth about this existential threat that we are facing and for calling for real action on climate change. It is a false equivalence that is part of the same old school of thinking that has stifled climate policy for well over a decade in this place. That false equivalence, pedalled by too many journalists and too many members of the commentariat in this building, is exactly what the LNP and the ALP use as cover.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are not two sides to climate science; there is just the science—but not enough of us are listening to the warnings of the scientists. What there are two sides to is the political debate about climate in this place. On one side you have the Australian Greens, who've listened to the science and have set their policies accordingly. On the other side of that political debate are the major parties, who are ignoring the science to benefit their corporate donors and to benefit their post-parliamentary careers. Every time that anyone in this place pretends there is any kind of moral equivalence between the two, you dumb down the debate and you play into the hands of those who have fed on uncertainty and doubt to lock in their obscene profits, to lock in the personal benefits they are making by destroying the climate and stealing the future off our children and our grandchildren.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been commentary recently from some journalists that both sides of the climate debate are over-egging their cases. Well, I say to those journalists: How the bloody hell do you over-egg four to six degrees of warming? How can you over-egg the fact that people are already dying as a result of climate change? How can you over-egg a genuine threat to the lives of every single person on the planet? How can you over-egg humanity's extinction? You can't! You can't over-egg those things. It is impossible to be too concerned about those things. How on earth can you pretend that anything that anyone in the Greens has said this week is more offensive, stupid or damaging than Mr Barnaby Joyce's claim that fluctuations in the sun's magnetic fields are responsible for the bushfires that are currently burning? How on earth can anything that we say be as stupid as that? It can't be. How on earth can anything we say be more troubling or more stupid than Senator Rennick's claim that the Bureau of Meteorology is altering records for a political agenda? It is impossible to say something more offensive or more silly than that. How on earth could anything the Greens have said this week be more insensitive than the Prime Minister waving around a lump of coal in this parliament when the country was in the middle of a heatwave? That's where the offence lies in this debate. It doesn't lie in anything the Greens have said; it lies in the things that Senator Rennick, the Prime Minister and Mr Joyce have said, and it lies in the timid acquiescence of the Labor Party to this government's climate-denying agenda.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those who seek to silence us are asking us to accept the muting blanket of civility because conflict makes them uncomfortable. Well, here's a newsflash: conflict, at times, is what politics is all about, and right now the forces of darkness are winning. To those who are offended by some of the strong language used by the Greens and by those brave people who are now taking direct action in our streets to raise their concerns about the lack of action on climate from the major parties, I say we are collectively offended by the death of the Great Barrier Reef; we are collectively offended at this gross act of intergenerational theft that you are perpetrating on our children and our grandchildren through the rape of this planet that you are all supporting; we are offended by the deforestation of Tasmania; and we are offended by the fact that you are collectively cooking and baking this planet for our children to die on. That is what we are offended about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no opportunity for consensus with the major parties in this place while they still support massive new coalmines like the one proposed by the Adani company. There is no opportunity for consensus with people who believe in fracking for gas in Queensland and the Northern Territory. There is no opportunity for consensus with people who still support mining for oil in the Great Australian Bight. There is no opportunity for consensus with people who still support strip-mining Tasmania's native forests in a direct public subsidy to corporate profits. There can be no agreement to fix the climate crisis so long as there continues to be a revolving door between parliament and the boardrooms of the big loggers and the big miners and so long as the dirty money flows to the main parties from the major polluters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you're worried about a lack of civility, you can stay worried, because this is a time for truth-telling. This is a time to put all our cards on the table, because the United Nations and the scientific community are telling us we've got a decade to get it right and, if we don't get it right, we are facing disaster</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator McKIM:</span>
                  </a>  So, while Senator Rennick and anyone else who wants to interject in this debate is calling for civility, I say: if you want civility, get your act together. Start listening to the science. Start listening to the warnings from the scientists. Start listening to your children as they rise up, rightfully demanding stronger action on the climate emergency. That's how you will get civility into this debate: by telling the truth, by taking the action that science is telling us we need to take and by making sure we help people through the inevitable massive transitions that will need to occur if we're going to avoid causing the extinction of humanity and probably many other species on this planet. I know that the very, very wealthy are already making their plans for their boltholes, and plenty of them—don't worry—will arrive in my home state of Tasmania over the journey. But I ask those people, and everyone here, to think about those billions of people in the world wracked by poverty, wracked by climate crisis, who will not have the choices or the opportunities that you have to do your best to look after the lives of your children and your grandchildren. If you want civility, start acting like you deserve it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:15</span>):  If that wasn't a case of the pot calling the kettle black, I don't know what is. I'm actually delivering this speech early in response to today's MPI, where Labor is alleging that the coalition government is failing to deliver for regional Australia. I asked to speak on it, but it was booked out in 20 minutes—no doubt because my colleagues on this side of the chamber are sick to death of Labor pretending to care about the bush. It is disgusting that Labor are exploiting the worst drought in a century in cheap, political pointscoring. If there is one party that doesn't have a leg to stand on when it comes to defending the bush, it's the Labor Party. Labor sold regional Australia down the toilet a long time ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's take a walk down memory lane, shall we? First, it was the great neoliberal traders Hawke and Keating who decided to sell Qantas. What a great idea that was! Now regional Australia has to pay more for flying regionally than it costs to fly overseas. After that there was the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. In the old days, the Commonwealth Bank used to have a development bank that would lend to farmers. After privatisation, that got rolled into business banking and the CBA, like every other bank in this country, became obsessed with housing rather than driving business and investment, especially in the regions. Of course, selling the CBA also meant that branches would close down in regional centres—and they have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next thing Keating did was introduce superannuation, and what a boon that has been for the bush—not! Superannuation has destroyed the income of people in the bush. Can you imagine if we went back, say, 40 years to when people used to get their pay in little yellow packets and some white-collared finance shark with their hair slicked back drove around all the country towns, pulling up in a sports car and taking 10 per cent of your income and telling you to come and see him when you turn 60 and he may or may not give it back to you depending on how good a strategy he had investing and risking your money? Why would you give this guy your money? You wouldn't. But, of course, that's exactly what happens every week. Millions of dollars gets sucked out of the pockets of the battlers in the bush and sent to the blowhards in Sydney and Melbourne to manage, all for a small cost of around $37 billion a year in management fees. That's great for creating jobs in the inner city and for Labor voters, but none of this money is ever reinvested in the bush, is it? No. The Hawke-Keating Labor government destroyed the bush with their reckless, neoliberal privatisation and centralised saving agenda. The industry funds are laughing all the way to the bank. The unions can't believe their luck. I'll be honest: the coalition sold out its personal responsibility values when it didn't stop this cancer called superannuation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, no discussion about Labor and the bush would be complete if we didn't talk about the complete and utter devastation that Queensland Labor has imposed upon regional Queensland. When I first moved to Brisbane in 1988 to start my studies at UQ, after 30 years of responsible coalition government Queensland was the powerhouse state of the nation. We had the cheapest energy in the world, we were a tourist hotspot and, most importantly, there was very little difference in opportunities across the regions. That's no longer the case, as the only growing sector in the Queensland economy is the bureaucracy sector in George Street, funded by bribes from ditzy Anna and dodgy Jackie to try to win votes in their ever-shrinking inner-city base. The rest of the state is broken, thanks to Labor mismanagement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirty years ago, my home town of Chinchilla had a maternity ward and no poker machines. Today it has poker machines and no maternity ward. There is no greater indictment of how utterly incompetent and morally bankrupt the Labor Party is than this statistic. The introduction of poker machines in Queensland by the so-called virtuous Goss government at the behest of unions was the start of the destruction of regional Queensland. As battlers in the bush became addicted to these dirty, stinking, one-armed, mechanical parasites, the royalties flowed to the corrupt Labor government. We never heard a word from corruption-busting Tony Fitzgerald about the destruction that gambling does to regional communities, did we?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, in the late nineties, Labor started shutting down regional maternity wards. Today, over 30 regional maternity wards have been shut down across Queensland and women in the bush are left to fend for themselves. The biggest cause of premature death of women in Third World countries is childbirth. Thanks to Labor, Queensland has become a Third World country.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A senator shall not digress from the subject matter of any question under discussion, or anticipate the discussion of any subject which appears on the Notice Paper.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the beginning of his contribution, Senator Rennick spoke about the MPI which is coming up later and said that he is speaking now in anticipation of a discussion that appears later on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> for today.</span>

                  </a>  Yes, Madam Acting Deputy President. As you'd be aware, senators' statements are wide ranging and the senator is quite within his rights to talk about his concerns for regional Australia. There is no gag on talking about regional Australia simply because there will be an MPI later on in the day.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator RENNICK:</span>
                  </a>  Thank you. Just about every nurse at Chinchilla Hospital was married to a farmer, and when years were tough it was the nurses' incomes that kept the farms going. I know that because my mother was a nursing midwife who would keep the ship steady when the family farm was going through drought. I would like to add that when the LNP did govern in Queensland between 2012 and 2015, they reopened three maternity wards, and we will do that again next year if elected into government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there were the council amalgamations. My home town once had its own council, as did many other small towns. My father was a third-generation councillor, back when it was unpaid. Now we take orders from another town up the road—great for democracy and regional representation that is!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I should point out that it was a Queensland Labor government that introduced vegetation management laws that have restricted property rights for farmers. Today, farmers are being locked up for feeding mulga to their stock to keep them alive in drought. Seriously, some of the people in Labor should come out to Charleville and Quilpie to see just how much mulga is out there. You've got to manage this stuff, as you do with all vegetation. You just can't leave it. If you do, when there is a fire the impact is devastating. That's not just my opinion; even the hippies in Nimbin are blaming the Greens for being against fire hazard reduction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And there is more: Labor is shutting down agricultural colleges. If you care about the environment, why would you shut those down? Our farmers are the ones who manage the land. If you want to look after it, then surely the best way to do that is to make sure they're up to date with best practice land management skills. But the reality is that Labor doesn't give a rat's pyjamas about the bush. They never have, and they never will. Labor is throwing beekeepers out of state forests, throwing fishermen off their boats and throwing roo-shooters off properties.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And last, but not least, there is privatisation. Queensland Labor went on a selling spree—lotteries, the trains, airports, ports, forestry plantations, gas assets, wind assets and motorways. One of the chief architects behind this was none other than Senator Watt, another typical Labor neoliberal traitor. Compare and contrast with what was built in the 30 years prior to Labor coming to power back in the eighties: Burdekin Dam; Wivenhoe Dam; the industrial powerhouse of Gladstone, with its aluminium smelters; the opening up of the Bowen Basin; Stanwell Power Station—</span>

And I should mention Brisbane, which was once just a big country town, but, like a frangipani blooming in the tropical paradise of Queensland, it came of age with the Commonwealth Games, World Expo, the Riverside Expressway and the opening of the Gateway Bridge. The Morrison coalition government, like all coalition governments of years gone by, believe in the bush. We'll stand strong, lending support to the regions as they endure the worst drought we've seen in a century.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="204953" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GALLACHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:26</span>):  What a pleasure it is to follow on from that contribution from Senator Rennick—very wide ranging as it was. I want to go to a much more mundane matter. During my capacity as deputy chair of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, six bills have been referred to that committee for report and action by the parliament. I think this would be very instructive. It's been nearly six months since the government was elected. Probably about 30 per cent of legislation in the parliament goes through the economics committee, and appropriately so. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The quality of that legislation is interesting. Let's take the first piece of legislation—the Treasury Laws Amendment (Putting Members' Interests First) Bill 2019. It sounds as though the government's on the right track and is trying to do the right thing by people with superannuation. However, the report of that committee found that the most frequently raised concern by inquiry participants related to the 1 October implementation. Many submitters stated that the date was unworkable and unachievable given the information system changes required and the need to contact many thousands of members. This was consistent with concerns raised during the prior inquiry, so it's not a new issue. The old bill lapsed, it came back in the new parliament and it didn't fix the old issues. A large number of submitters argued that members in high-risk occupations should be exempted from the opt-in arrangements. That wasn't agreed, so now we have a situation in which people thought they were covered in the last year and, if they're unfortunate enough to be injured or killed this year, they simply won't be covered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The matter of premium increases resulting from the proposed changes to default group insurance arrangements was also raised as a common concern. If you take a whole lot of people out of a group life insurance policy, you simply increase the premiums when they come back in. If they decide to opt in, there's no guarantee they would get the same level of cover they had before. Legislation which starts by putting members' interests first appears to be doing exactly the opposite, at least in some cases.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we look at the Treasury Laws Amendment (2019 Tax Integrity and Other Measures No. 1) Bill 2019, once again we find ambiguity concerning rightful discussions. Many submissions expressed concerns over what can and cannot be claimed as a deduction under this proposal. It was highlighted by the Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand. They asked whether newly constructed apartments with structural faults would be caught up in this legislation. The Inspector-General of Taxation and Taxation Ombudsman felt that the bill, as drafted, did not sufficiently discern between taxpayers who are engaging with the ATO on their debt and those who are not. The IGTO acknowledged that, should a business be accidentally put on a list and reported to a credit bureau, it would be potentially catastrophic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Taxpayers may not be aware that this bill amends the Taxation Administration Act 1953 'to allow taxation officers to disclose the business tax debt information of a taxpayer to a credit reporting bureau when certain conditions and safeguards' are met. The Inspector-General of Taxation and the Taxation Ombudsman believe that that isn't as watertight as it should be. A number of submitters put very cogent, well-researched evidence to the committee; it hasn't been addressed in the legislation or by the government at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We come to the Intellectual Property Laws Amendment (Productivity Commission Response Part 2 and Other Measures) Bill. There were a small number of affected manufacturers in Australia using the innovation provisions to safeguard their business, safeguard their investment in their small business and maintain manufacturing in Australia, using the innovation patent system to do so. This is all being disbanded, and in its place is a promise to do something which is not exactly helping those small businesses that had a use for this protection.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We go on to the next bill, the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation Amendment Bill. The front page of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span> yesterday said: 'We're not really sure what this is actually going to do. The banks want to charge a bit more interest.' In effect, it's a bill to provide a subsidy for 10,000 first home buyers. It's a subsidy that will stand in the place of lender mortgage insurance for up to 10,000 first home buyers. Instead of having a 20 per cent deposit you will need only five per cent—the government will guarantee the 15 per cent—and the marketplace will give you a loan. Most of the commentary in this space is that first home buyers grants actually put up the price of housing. When we questioned the Treasury and other departments about this, about the investigation, research and advice that was given to the minister before he brought the scheme in, they answered: 'Parliament was prorogued. We weren't able to do any of that.' When we questioned NHFIC and others about how it was actually going to operate—did they think it would actually bring 110,000 first home buyers to the market?—the answer, basically, was that we'd have to wait and see.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These pieces of legislation have some commonality. They are poorly drafted, there is a lack of research underpinning them and there are unintended consequences. We will know in the course of this parliament what those unintended consequences will be, I'm sure of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Next is the Treasury Laws Amendment (Prohibiting Energy Market Misconduct) Bill. The report on this bill by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A key concern with the bill is the significant ambiguity in the definitions around which prohibited conduct is established and the remedies are constructed. As a consequence, some submissions argued the bill will create complexity and uncertainty, result in legal challenges whose costs will be passed to consumers, and will discourage investment in required new and replacement electricity generation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not making this up. This is from evidence drawn from inquiry, submission, testing and weighting of evidence in a government concluded report that was signed by the chair of the committee. We know that the only entity in this space that has incurred the wrath of the regulator is the Snowy Hydro scheme, which was fined $400,000 and asked to pay $100,000 to the regulator's costs for not following correct instructions about the dispatching of power. At the time it was owned by the federal government, the New South Wales government and the Victorian government. The evidence in this space about misconduct is that the Snowy Hydro scheme got fined but none of the other retailers, none of the other electricity providers, got fined. From the talk going on around this bill there appears to have been a bit of a competition between two rather large egos—on one hand someone from AGL and on the other hand someone from the government—who had different views about the world. Some intemperate remarks were made and the 'big stick' legislation came about. No-one in the industry supports it, the Law Council says it will probably fail at the first challenge and the minister in his speech when he introduced it said it's unlikely to be used.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So here we are, six months into a government, with six bills having gone to the legislation committee for inquiry. To add insult to injury, there is the Treasury Laws Amendment (Recovering Unpaid Superannuation) Bill, which forgives those people who haven't paid superannuation for their workers for 26 years. If you come forward and have a rough stab at guessing your records, you'll be forgiven penalties and the like. The penalties are reasonably significant, but this bill legalises wage theft. It sends a message that wage theft is acceptable. The evidence is that amnesties are not effective. Employers are not compelled to keep records beyond six or seven years, and this amnesty for 26 years defies belief. But that's the first six months or thereabouts of this government. We look forward to some legislation coming through the Senate Economics Legislation Committee which we can talk about as being good legislation, because I haven't seen any. Of these six pieces of legislation, most are poorly drafted, have unintended consequences and don't meet the requirements of what they set out to do.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="53369" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DI NATALE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  I rise today to pay tribute to the amazing work of the many firefighters and volunteers who have put their lives at risk over the past few days. We've seen vast expanses of this country burning. We've seen the loss of life and property, yet things have been remarkably contained considering the scale of these megafires. It is truly awe-inspiring to see what Australian men and women, many of them volunteers, have achieved in keeping us safe. Their professionalism, their dedication and their compassion are nothing short of inspiring. To the 3,000-plus firefighters on the ground right now: we thank you from the bottom of our hearts for everything that you do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is heartbreaking about these fires, though, is not just the loss of life and the loss of property and habitat; it's that these megafires and, indeed, the preceding stubborn drought that we are experiencing are locked into our climate system and that this is the new normal. What we are seeing today, and what we will see into the future, is the consequence of record high levels of carbon pollution in this country, and that is the great challenge facing all of us, not just as Australians but, indeed, as global citizens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The question for each and every one of us is: how much worse are we prepared to let things be? We know right now that each tonne of coal that we burn, each gas well that we sink, each bit of land that we frack and each stockpile of coal that finds its way to Asia will make our climate crisis worse, with more loss of life, more loss of property, more dry conditions and more heat. So the question before us is: do we think that our firefighters and other emergency service workers deserve this future? Of course we don't. Do we think that people who live in bushfire-prone areas deserve to face the threat of megafires and increasingly long bushfire seasons, with the threat of loss of life and property that that entails? Of course we don't. So, if the answer to those questions is no, why do we allow the exponential increase in the burning and exporting of coal and gas to continue? We have the knowledge right now about how to address one of the primary drivers of this climate crisis producing bushfires. Why is it that we're not seeing the sort of action that is being taken right across the world?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, we know that there are big coal and gas companies making megaprofits out of exploiting Australian resources, and we know that there is an agreement—a consensus—between the Liberal, National and Labor parties that they'll continue to take those massive donations which mean that they're quicker to meet with their coal, oil and gas donors than they are to meet with the 23 fire chiefs who have desperately sought a meeting with the Prime Minister. We have known for decades that this is the future for Australia and we have known for decades what we need to do to stop our planet from burning. And yet this government has fought and sabotaged every effort to keep our community safe from the ravages of a collapsing climate system. But I sense that things are changing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Eleven thousand scientists have signed on to declare a climate emergency. Fire chiefs, in the midst of these megafires, are speaking out about the need to deal with climate change. Indeed, survivors of this catastrophe are making it clear that now is the time to talk about climate change. They're making it clear that they are the victims of a climate emergency. Scientists, emergency services workers and the victims of these fires are speaking in one voice, imploring our government to take action—to declare a climate emergency, to reduce carbon pollution, to begin the phase-out of coal and gas and to transition to a 100 per cent renewable energy future, with the jobs and employment opportunities that come with that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the aftermath of another tragedy—the Port Arthur gun massacre—we saw leadership from a Prime Minister. We saw a Prime Minister who recognised that we were in a moment of national mourning and that the country was crying out for action. He was a man who was prepared to take on members of his own coalition. He was prepared to lean across the political aisle by working with the Labor Party and, indeed, with the Greens on the basis of our National Firearms Agreement. It was forged in the work that the Greens were doing in the Tasmanian parliament. And it was that national agreement which made Australia a safer place; it kept people in the community safe for decades to come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is this Prime Minister's moment. Now is the time for this Prime Minister to recognise that this is a nation crying out for action on climate change. This is a moment where he must drop his resistance to the reality of climate change and where he has to take on those members of his coalition who have stubbornly refused to act. He needs to reach across the political aisle and he needs to work cooperatively with the states. He needs to sideline those who deny the threats to science and he should embrace the progress, technology and jobs that come with transforming our society to a pollution-free future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know what we have to do. We've known for years. We can build a renewable energy economy that will produce tens of thousands of jobs. We have to invest significantly to enhance our capacity for improved land management and a national disaster response. We have to phase out coal, oil and methane gas to ensure that we reduce pollution and so that we have an approach to climate change that is consistent with the science.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, there is so much to gain in this new future: new jobs, revitalising the regions and ensuring that people who are right now facing the threat of dangerous climate change can realise those opportunities that come from making this transition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is our moment. This is the moment for this parliament to come together, but it will only come together if this Prime Minister recognises that we are a nation being torn apart because we have members of his government who refuse to address the climate emergency that is confronting us. We urge the Prime Minister to reach across the political aisle like John Howard did all those years ago and to meet with the opposition leader, to meet with the Greens, to meet with members of the crossbench and to forge a path forward by declaring a climate emergency and developing a pathway to reduce our pollution from coal, oil and gas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />This could be the moment that makes this Prime Minister and this government. It is up to him. If he continues on the path that we're on, he will have failed in his duty to protect Australians and to ensure that we keep future generations safe from our climate crisis. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ANTIC</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  I rise this afternoon to congratulate the residents of Kimba in rural South Australia and to speak about an exciting opportunity for South Australia. On Thursday of last week, the five-week community ballot regarding the proposal for a national radioactive waste management facility in Kimba closed. The question posed to members of the community of Kimba was: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Do you support the proposed National Radioactive Waste Management Facility being located at one of the nominated sites in the community of Kimba?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The construction of such a facility is an essential part of the nuclear medicine which one in every two Australians will require in their lifetime. It will manage the disposal of low-level radioactive waste used in said nuclear medicines, which we make at the Lucas Heights facility near Sydney. Nuclear medicines have allowed us to control and often cure conditions like cancer and thyroid conditions and are used in medical imaging. These forms of waste are currently held on a temporary basis in more than 100 locations across the country, including universities, hospital basements, research facilities and suburban areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over 90 per cent of the community in Kimba participated in the vote, with 61.58 per cent voting yes and 38.42 per cent voting no. This significant level of community support for the site being built in Kimba reveals how engaged the community there have been throughout the process and how the local community understands the strong economic case for a nuclear industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that a site in the Flinders Ranges Council area in rural South Australia is also being considered, and their community is also conducting a similar ballot of their own. The successful location will be the beneficiary of a federal community development package of up to $31 million, including a $21 million community fund to provide long-term support for the region, $8 million of grants to strengthen the economic and skills base of the host community and $3 million from the government's Indigenous Advancement Strategy to support the delivery of an Aboriginal economic heritage participation plan. This will kickstart infrastructure, apprenticeships and other skills needed to build the facility and will not require fly-in fly-out workers. It will create 45 local jobs and provide an enormous economic benefit to the local community. The Mayor of Kimba, Dean Johnson, has noted:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In times of drought, you just get reminded again of how reliant we are on agriculture. An alternative industry would be good for the town.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me tell you that the mayor's comments are accurate and should not be exclusive to Kimba alone; they could well be extrapolated to the state as a whole. South Australia needs new, bold industries like the nuclear industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2015 the Scarce royal commission found that South Australia's economy would benefit from an expanded exploration and mining industry, the future generation of electricity from nuclear fuel and the safe management and disposal of internationally used nuclear fuel and that the state could benefit by as much as $100 billion over expenditure for the 120-year life cycle of a storage project.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report confirmed that a visionary proposal to delve into the lucrative world of nuclear technology is possible. The chance to transform the South Australian economy is right before us. The flow-on effects to the economy would be enormous. Our energy intensive desalination plant could be running year round. Our scientific and tertiary sectors would boom, and with potential customers likes China, India, the United Arab Emirates and other Arab states forging ahead with nuclear generation we'd have customers lining up for storage. Literally billions of dollars are there for the taking. A nuclear industry would mean jobs, growth and real energy for South Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I congratulate the people of Kimba for engaging in the ballot and supporting the establishment of the new radioactive waste management facility. I look forward to the outcome of the second ballot in rural South Australia. Although I acknowledge this is but an early development, it is my hope that it represents the genesis of a nuclear industry for South Australia. The economic benefits for my home state and this nation cannot be underestimated and must be explored.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HZB" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BILYK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  I had a meeting recently with John Hooper, the CEO of the NILS Network of Tasmania. NILS, or the No Interest Loans Scheme, is a great initiative which helps low-income people take out small no-interest loans for various reasons, such as for purchasing household essentials, paying out-of-pocket medical expenses or even starting a small business. Mr Hooper told me that before many NILS clients come to the organisation for help they are in significant debt. While it's against NILS's policy to pay existing debts, they can help clients to meet other expenses. Many of those debts that people come to NILS with are payday loans with crippling interest rates. On top of the fees for these small loans, consumers are paying annual interest rates of between 100 and 400 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Hooper showed me an example of one of these loans. I will call the person with this loan Jane. I actually don't know her real name, because all the personal information on the form was redacted. But Jane bought a refrigerator valued at $1,797. She was given a three-year loan, with payments of $70 a fortnight. This meant the total value of the loan was a whopping $5,460, more than three times the price of the original purchase. This equates to an effective interest rate of about 155 per cent per annum. Had Jane gone through NILS, she would have also received a 50 per cent subsidy under the Tasmanian Energy Efficiency Loan Scheme and she could have purchased a fridge for about one-seventh of the price she finally ended up paying.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The NILS Network of Tasmania is one of 26 members of the Stop the Debt Trap Alliance. The alliance is a coalition of welfare and community services organisations that are calling on the Morrison government to introduce stronger laws to regulate payday loans and consumer leases. Yesterday they released a report, titled <span style="font-style:italic;">The debt trap</span>, which shows the damage that some predatory lending practices are having on vulnerable people. The report found that the value of the payday loan market will reach $1.7 billion this year. I'm really sad to say that my home state of Tasmania is leading the nation in growth in payday loans, with a 15 per cent increase last year. There are close to a million financially distressed and financially stressed households with payday loans, an almost threefold increase since 2005.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While these statistics are shocking enough, the report also includes a number of case studies that demonstrate the human cost of these loans. One story I found particularly tragic was that of Charlie, an Aboriginal woman in her 20s, whose name has also been changed for privacy reasons. I just want to read to you part of the report about Charlie's circumstances. This is directly from the report:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Approximately 5 years ago, when she was under 20-years old, Charlie started a business traineeship earning a little over $450 per week. Around this time, Charlie was also going through a really hard time. Charlie's father had passed away shortly before Charlie had tragically given birth to a baby that was stillborn. Charlie needed money to pay for the cremation services for her baby. Charlie therefore took out a payday loan for a little under $650. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">With all of this anguish and stress, however, Charlie became mentally unwell and was no longer able to work, sending Charlie into significant financial difficulty. Charlie's only source of income became the Centrelink pension which she was using to pay rent, groceries and things for her young child. Charlie fell behind on her payday loan repayments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The payday loan contract was originally for a principal amount of a little under $650. However, Charlie was also charged an up-front establishment fee of a little under $130, ongoing monthly fees and dishonour fees if she didn't have enough money in her bank account to pay the loan. This meant that every time she missed a payment because it was dishonoured, Charlie was charged a dishonour fee of a little under $35. To this day, Charlie has been unable to pay back this payday loan and now owes much more than she originally borrowed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Charlie experienced money trouble for several years and she turned to other forms of unregulated credit to help her meet general living expenses. These included getting another payday loan and also using buy now pay later services. For the buy now pay later debt, Charlie was only able to make one payment before she fell into arrears and started being contacted by debt collectors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to her baby and her father, Charlie's mother also passed away in the last couple of years. Charlie was the next of kin for both her father and mother and her main financial priority since their passing was paying for the funerals of her loved ones—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">her mother, her father and her baby.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Any spare money that Charlie had was going towards paying for these funerals and then paying off funeral directors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Charlie was sent to prison in 2019 leaving her with no income at all, no way to pay off her debts and no repayment options to get out of the debt trap.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's called a debt trap because borrowers often take out further loans when they struggle to meet the basics of living, leading them into a spiral of debt from which they cannot escape.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Three years ago, the government released their response to the small-amount credit contract, or SACC, review. They committed to introducing legislation to crack down on some of these predatory lending practices and to protect vulnerable Australians. In 15 days, it will be exactly three years since the government made that commitment, so where is the legislation? They even released an exposure draft in 2017. To progress the issue, because they're a bit slow with some things on that side, Labor has repeatedly introduced private members' bills into parliament identical to the government's exposure draft. However, the government have stubbornly refused to progress our legislation or to introduce their own. Three years since the government promised action, vulnerable Australians on low incomes are continuing to be exploited by lenders for profit and to fall into the cycle of debt. While hundreds of thousands of Australians are suffering from these crippling loans, the Morrison government's failure to rein in these predatory lending practices is disgraceful. So it's time that those opposite actually started to act on this sort of issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to point out that research shows that payday loans are made easily accessible through digital platforms, but often borrowers are not fully aware of the risks, the consequences and the on-costs that go with these loans. A decade ago, only 5.6 per cent of payday loans originated online, but by the end of this year, 2019, that figure is predicted to increase to almost 86 per cent. Aggressive marketing techniques are used, which is part of the reason for the increase in demand. Part of the sell of the advertising is advice on good budgeting, which is quite a misleading message—that payday loans are somehow linked to good financial management.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got the Prime Minister and the Treasurer of this country, who finally, after having been taken kicking and screaming to the royal commission, act all tough on the financial institutions and the big banks, but they're letting payday lenders escape legislative reform, and I want to know why. There's no doubt that there is broad consensus that stronger consumer protections are needed and it's time the federal government protected Australians from financial harm and introduced these changes as a matter of urgency to the parliament. It's been over four years, as I said, since the small-amount credit contract review was initiated and three years since the government accepted the recommendation. What is the hold-up? Why is there a hold-up?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Is it because this affects the most vulnerable in our community, those who are economically disadvantaged and excluded from accessing mainstream finances? Or is it because this government just can't get their act together, they just don't care, they're constantly in chaos and they don't care what happens to vulnerable and low-income Australians? This matter needs to be looked at urgently. Payday loans cannot go on so unregulated that people are getting into debt and having to go to jail.</span>
              </p>

New data released today confirms that already stagnant wages growth has slowed further since the election. Can the minister confirm that today's ABS wages data reveals that annual wage growth has fallen to a low of just 2.2 per cent and, at just 0.5 per cent, Australian workers experienced no real wages growth in the September quarter?</span>

When Senator Gallagher, in a rather misleading way, seeks to focus on the nominal growth, she ignores the fact that inflation is also comparatively low. What I can confirm is that the wage price index rose by 2.2 per cent through the year to the September quarter; private sector wages grew by 2.2 per cent through the year; the private sector WPI, including bonus payments, grew by 2.8 per cent; and public sector wages grew by 2.5 per cent. What I can also confirm is that real wages grew by 0.6 per cent, higher than the 0.4 per cent through the year when Labor lost government, and 0.6 per cent is higher than when Labor lost government and is indeed in line with the 20-year average.</span>

But obviously when inflation runs higher that 0.6 per cent, on average over the long-term, leads to a higher nominal growth figure than it would in the context of the current low inflation environment. That is very obvious. The situation is stronger than it was under Labor.</span>

Real wages growth is stronger today that it was in Labor's last year in government. And, indeed, we turned around the rapidly rising unemployment rate that we inherited from the Labor Party, with about 1.5 million new jobs created. Workforce participation is the second highest on record, female workforce participation is the highest on record and welfare dependency of the working-age population is the lowest it's ever been.</span>

And, yet, do you know what? The Australian economy continues to grow. We are in our 29th year of continuous growth. If we had adopted the policy prescriptions of the Labor Party—the socialist, high-taxing, antibusiness agenda that Labor took to the last election—the economy today would be weaker. Employment would be higher, and wages would be lower. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

And I want to thank the chamber for its support on the farm household allowance bill that was passed yesterday. Our farmers contribute significantly to our national prosperity, and many, as we know, are suffering the impacts of drought. Today many of these very same farmers are helping their own communities, or those in other states, with their Rural Fire Service to help fight fires. We want to thank them for their service. It's important to note that, with the drought, there is often bipartisan support for measures to assist. I appreciate the support of the Labor Party, the Greens, Centre Alliance senators, Senator Bernardi and other crossbenchers for frontline support for drought affected farmers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday I met with dairy farmers from Queensland and New South Wales who are experiencing hardship from the high input costs of fodder, water and electricity. The farm household allowance works to support farmers in many forms of hardship, whether caused by high input costs or drought or needed in the aftermath of the terrible bushfires scorching much of the New South Wales and Queensland coast. FHA provides farmers and their families with money for basic household necessities while they make decisions about the future of their farm businesses and take action to improve their circumstances, with the support of our Rural Financial Counselling Service.</span>

We changed the way we treat off-farm income. We have also changed it, for the first time, so that farmers generating income from agistment will have that income considered against their losses. Importantly, it will allow for the minister to make a rule to provide these relief payments to people who have exhausted their first four years on FHA, going forward, without having to come back to the—</span>

It was great last week to be able to join you to see how the drought was affecting the Barkly cattlemen, who have been destocking for the last 18 months. In addition to the FHA, our government has committed over $8 billion of measures to support farmers, their families and rural and regional communities to get through the drought and to support them well into recovery. We've always sought to provide support in the here and now. That includes the Rural Financial Counselling Service, mental health services and concessional loans, and, for the first time in this package, for it to be available to regional small businesses to help them with interest costs and cash flow issues over the next two years. </span>

Thirdly, it is about the future and resilience.</span>

Our government believes that agriculture has a very bright future in this country, and we want to ensure that our regional communities are vibrant places where people want to come and live and work. We're supportive of that positive future, with a $5 billion Future Drought Fund providing sustainable and ongoing much-needed cash to support communities and farmers to prepare for the next drought with resilience programs. There is $3.3 billion in funding for water projects to build dams, to assist farmers with on-farm water infrastructure and to build the weirs and pipelines so that we can get water from where it falls to where it's actually needed to grow safe, sustainable and nutritious food not just for us but for the world. We have farm management deposit schemes to help farmers prepare for the future. We will continue to stand with them through this drought and well into recovery.</span>

On the same day record low growth for Australians under this government is again confirmed, Morrison government MPs, including the member for Goldstein, the member for McKellar and the member for Hughes—Mr Wilson, Mr Falinski and Mr Kelly—have all lined up to publicly criticise the Reserve Bank. Given the Morrison government continues to refuse to heed the advice of the Reserve Bank to stimulate the economy, including by bringing forward vital infrastructure investment, can the minister advise when this government will stop criticising the RBA and start heeding its advice?</span>

Our economy in the June quarter was growing at half a per cent, and here is the Labor Party saying that the sky is about to fall in!

Minister, Aaron Crowe, from Warrawillah on the New South Wales Mid North Coast, whose house is now in ashes, told the media yesterday: 'In this bucket is my house. When's the time to talk about climate change, then, if I'm standing in the wreckage of my own house?' Minister, what is your answer to Mr Crowe's question?</span>

It's great to have you back with us. As you will have noticed, during this whole week the parliament has been moved by Australians who are suffering through the most catastrophic bushfire event that our nation has seen. We know that Australians have lost their lives and that hundreds of Australians are without a home, having lost all their worldly belongings—their family photo albums et cetera. As I said in this place earlier on in this week, and as others have said—Senator Wong and Senator Cormann—now is not the time to be debating policy. We need to be very careful, as leaders in our community, about politicising what is one of the most catastrophic bushfire seasons in living memory. Fires are caused by a variety of factors—climate change; drought, which makes the fuel load drier and more combustible; and fuel management. We know, when we're looking after our natural resources, whether they be our state or national parks, that our state and territory governments have to get those practices right. Scientists and firefighters have made it clear that these are the areas that we need to address as a community so that we can address the severe impacts and the risks that they provide to our broader Australian community, now and into the future.</span>

Of course, I know this brings together issues very important and dear to your heart in terms of support for rural and regional Australian communities and, of course, support for all Australian schoolchildren to be able to access a quality education. The Morrison government firmly believes that every Australian child, no matter where they live and no matter their circumstances, should have access to a world-class education be that early education, school education or tertiary education. That's why we continue to provide record funding for early childhood education and child care, some $8.6 billion this year growing through to $9.9 billion by 2021-22. It's why we're providing record funding for Australian schools, some $310 billion over the next 10 years, an increase of 62 per cent per student. And it's why we're providing record funding for Australian universities, some $17.7 billion in this year alone.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that in these difficult times of drought Australian communities stand together and support one another, Australian schools lend a hand and support one another and, as a government, we stand firmly in support of those communities and those schools as well. It's why we've worked to provide additional special circumstances funding in a number of targeted ways over the course of this year. It's by initially providing some $4 million in special circumstances funding particularly for schools affected by floods in north Queensland, but earlier this month now extending that, providing $10 million in special circumstances funding to support schools facing financial hardship as a result of the ongoing drought conditions affecting much of Australia—and particularly much of New South Wales where you come from, Senator Hughes. This is important support for schools, for the families and for those students in terms of providing additional practical assistance that complements the types of drought measures that Senator McKenzie was outlining to the chamber earlier and is all part of the comprehensive approach our government is taking to responding to the drought.</span>

Some schools offer fee concessions, discounts; others have had to step up financial assistance counselling or counselling services to individual students. The funding that we are providing is intended to help ensure that schools remain financially viable, that students who need it are supported with additional counselling services, that assistance is there for families in drought affected areas in terms of fee relief where they need it—all of which complements other programs such as the Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme, which provides targeted assistance to support families in rural and regional Australia. We're applying this program in a way where we're seeking applications from schools in drought affected areas to make sure the dollars flow to those who need it most.</span>

The Community Child Care Fund program will deliver a total of $327 million over five years to around 980 services, of which some $224 million has been allocated to more than 480 services in regional and remote parts of Australia. Earlier this month the Morrison government announced that a further $5 million is being made available from the Community Child Care Fund, especially in targeted support for early learning centres that cater for children aged from zero to five who attend centres in drought affected areas. Where a service is experiencing decreased demand or financial pressure due to drought conditions it's eligible to apply for a special circumstances grant of up to $10,000 under a streamlined process to ensure funds are quickly available on the ground, enabling them to better support their families. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The National Party is standing with our nation's dairy farmers ad nauseam, as we've debated through question time this week. We're very proud to be the only party that took to the election what the dairy farmers in this country wanted. They came together and voted as one for a mandatory dairy code on the back of the ACCC inquiry that we called and that we actually followed up on. The ACCC recommended delivering a dairy code.</span>

                  </a>  Senator O'Neill, we took to the election to put in a mandatory code for the dairy industry should we win the election. We did. The Labor Party put forward a floor price. Joel had a whole suite of initiatives that he was going to do. They didn't want that. They wanted the mandatory dairy code of conduct and a whole raft of measures that we committed to: legal and financial advice within the ACCC, support for energy efficiency grants et cetera. And I've run through them publicly several times. That code was not to be delivered until 1 July next year.</span>

So the department and the Office of Parliamentary Counsel were doing everything they could to turn the nine principles that were agreed by industry into a legal document, and the exposure draft that's out for consultation now with the industry was produced.</span>

I am going to check that word. I'm certain it's been used before. If not, I'll come back and ask the senator to withdraw.

That was about a particularly offensive term, if I recall correctly. Context does matter. I don't think this word has been ruled unparliamentary before. I will check that. If it has, I'll come back to the chamber. As I've said, my view is that, if a word has been used and other presidents have allowed it, so will I. If the chamber wants to express its view that it's unparliamentary, I'll enforce it. But I'm not going to make a unilateral ruling on a word that has been used. Can I repeat my plea: this problem doesn't arise if senators don't use the language. An allusion can be made to language without necessarily quoting it and then we won't have this distraction. I'll come to Senator McKenzie on the answer to the final supplementary question.</span>

Senator Bragg and I had the opportunity to visit Settlement Services International recently, and we met with a number of refugees who have come to Australia, and who, with the support of government, are now running their own very successful small and family businesses.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government understands the value of small and family businesses to the Australian economy, and we understand that when you back small and family businesses you help them to prosper, to grow and, of course, to create more jobs for Australians. But you have to get the policy environment right. Implementing higher taxes, I can assure you, Mr President, is not one of those policy environments that we want to be in. On this side of the chamber, we have successfully lowered the tax rate for small and family businesses from 30 per cent to 27½ per cent, and we know it will go down to 25 per cent in 2021-2022.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also addressing the issue of access to finance for small and family businesses with our $2 billion Australian Business Securitisation Fund, and we have also committed to an Australian business growth fund. This will provide long-term equity funding to small businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know, though, that being paid on time is a priority for small and family businesses. We're taking the lead, as the government, in relation to this. As of 1 July this year, the government is paying invoices up to the value of $1 million within 20 days. And the finance minister and I have recently announced that as of 1 January 2020 Commonwealth government agencies will start paying e-invoices within five days and that, if we don't, we will pay interest on any late payments.</span>

My home state of South Australia currently has an unemployment rate of 6.3 per cent, which is higher than the national average. I've been speaking to a number of people who are desperately trying to get into the job market and finding it very difficult. Whilst I acknowledge the government's jobactive system has some high-performing providers, it also has a number of dodgy providers who have been milking the system without providing effective outcomes. When will the government take meaningful action to stop these dodgy providers preying on vulnerable jobseekers at taxpayers' expense?</span>

The Australian government is, of course, committed, and very proud to be committed, to getting Australians off welfare and into work. One of the ways that we do that is through our world-class employment services system. What this system does is help prepare Australians for meaningful and sustainable work opportunities.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's principal employment service is known as jobactive. If you compare it to the former contract, Job Services Australia, jobactive is delivering more 26-week outcomes at a lower cost. From July 2015 to October 2019, jobactive achieved 1.5 million job placements, and it continues to achieve around 1,000 job placements per day.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">You referred to the integrity of jobactive providers. I can assure you the government are committed to the integrity of jobactive providers and we expect a very high level of service for their clients. Each provider is given a star rating. This star rating is publicly available, so a jobseeker can actually go online to the department's website and compare providers.

He informed me that under jobactive he's referred to as 'stream C', which, I understand, means he needs the most support to get work. He says he feels that his jobactive provider is not supporting him with the services he needs given the barriers he faces and is simply interested in ticking the bureaucratic box in order to get their money from the government. Given the government says it's committed to getting young people off welfare and into work, what is the government doing to help people like Paul? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

There is flexibility in the system for jobseekers like your constituent Paul. Providers themselves have access to what is called an employment fund. It is a fund that is obviously set up by the government. Through this fund, the provider is able to ensure that the jobseeker—in this case it's a stream C jobseeker, as you've identified, and they have the most barriers out of all of the jobseekers—will get the tailored support that they need to get off welfare and into work. But what we're also doing as a government is transforming employment services to ensure that we deliver better outcomes for jobseekers and employers and a better system for providers. We are redesigning the system so that stream C jobseekers, like Paul, have access to the most opportunities to move from welfare—</span>

In fact, the transparency of the five-star rating system ensures that a jobseeker is able to go online and compare their providers, and, if they see there's a better provider, or if they want to move because another provider is closer to where they're located, they are able to do this. At the same time, they are then entitled to the same level of service. So you can absolutely go back to your constituent and advise them that they are able to transfer. There are mechanisms available to the constituent in the event that they do want to. They can call the department's national customer service line. The department will actually assist them in changing over providers and, again, they will ensure that, if they do want to change providers or if they identify that they're not quite sure which provider they can go to, that assistance will be given and there is no penalty.</span>

At the moment, we have a situation where 246 reports are in the President's report, of which there are 205 outstanding responses from government. So 205 reports out of 246 have not been responded to. I remind the government that the Senate and the parliament initiate inquiries and that they do so as they seek to represent their constituents. The parliament or the Senate calls for submissions, which take a lot of work. A lot of people put a lot of time and effort into submissions to the parliament. Then, of course, we go to places, at taxpayers' expense, and sometimes people come to us at their expense, to allow us to hear from people. A considerable amount of work is done by the secretariat and the committees themselves in respect of developing coherent committee reports. When I say that time has been spent, I talk about time that's been spent by government senators, opposition senators and, indeed, senators on the crossbench.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I appreciate that the government might not always have an affinity with the recommendations. They have the ability to respond by rejecting those recommendations. But certainly there is a moral responsibility for government to respond to all of these inquiries, noting that, in some sense, by not doing so they're not being respectful to the people. In my view, they're also not meeting a constitutional obligation to respond to the parliament. It's in that vein that I'm pleased to hear that Minister Birmingham has indicated that we might get a response by the end of this year. I draw the chamber's attention to the fact that there are so many other reports that have simply not been responded to by government.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FARUQI</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:06</span>):  I rise to take note of the government's continuing failure to front up to the PFAS affected communities that they have abandoned. Nearly a month ago, I told the Senate that every day the government delays responding to this report shows its contempt not only for the Senate but for the thousands of people who have lived with contamination of their land and their water, caused by the government. Here we are again, nearly a year since the Senate report into PFAS contamination was tabled in this place, and there has been no response whatsoever from the government. There is no justification, really, for the delay. Yes, we all understand it's a complex issue, but we deal with complex issues every single day. And saying that you intend to release the report by the end of the year is, frankly, not good enough. There is no commitment, really, to bringing justice and closure to the victims of this contamination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to appreciate how we have reached this point. When the report was tabled last December, I said that, if the government care about the community, if they care about our environment, they should urgently accept the recommendations of the report. They don't have to wait for months to provide a response. But months they waited. In January, I visited communities in Williamtown, Salt Ash and Bobs Farm areas, where residents are really sick and tired of having to fight the federal government for compensation for the pollution of their land and water by the Department of Defence. They are really exhausted. They, too, were calling on the government to respond with a proper compensation package that, importantly, must include buybacks of properties that have been significantly affected. Still, the government were silent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In July, this place passed my motion that ordered the government to release a response. This order for the production of documents passed the Senate after it had been more than seven months since the joint standing committee tabled its report. For seven more months affected communities waited anxiously. Still the government ignored the Senate's call and those of worried residents around the country. By September, I said that enough is enough and moved with others in this place to order the government to table their response. Not only did the government fail to respond, but they told this chamber they didn't even have a response to give. They've had the committee recommendations in front of them for almost one year now and they still don't have a response to give us. What a slap in the face of the communities that have waited more than long enough, communities that have suffered for more than long enough, communities that deserve concrete action—not just now; that action should have happened years ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last month in October, I spoke with the Hawkesbury Environment Network about contamination in Richmond and around New South Wales. I also visited the so-called 'red zone' in Williamtown, where PFAS affected residents have been left in limbo by state and federal governments and the Department of Defence, who, it seems, don't give a damn. Linden Drysdale was one of the citizens I met. After our meeting, she told the <span style="font-style:italic;">Port Stephens Examiner</span>:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are with the residents of Williamtown, the residents of Richmond and the communities around the country that this government is leaving hung out to dry. Such is the absolute justified frustration of community members that late last month they launched the largest class action Australia has ever seen. Up to 40,000 people who live and work on the land contaminated by PFAS are taking the government to court to demand justice for the harm this contamination has done to property values that now trap them in an incredibly dangerous situation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every day that this government slows down the process and every day that they deny compensation to communities who deserve solid action, the lack of action drives affected people further into the ground financially. Not only that, the lack of action has impacted people's mental and physical wellbeing immensely. These communities did nothing wrong. Their land was contaminated by the Department of Defence but the community is expected now to bear the cost of living with PFAS contamination. You have the luxury of sitting here wasting time and obfuscating, but they don't. People are at breaking point. The government needs to take action, and it needs to take action now. It is the height of arrogance for this government to refuse to respond to the community and also a Senate inquiry. Ultimately, the federal government must take responsibility for the PFAS pollution. The community has waited and suffered long enough. It is time for action. Thousands of lives have been changed by the PFAS contamination, pushing communities to breaking point. Government neglect has forced people to wait for too long. The government must immediately release their response to the PFAS report.</span>

In particular, the inquiry went to the affected places in the Northern Territory, Queensland and New South Wales. To all those families out there who are still waiting for a respectful response—well, it's too late, isn't it, Madam Deputy President? It was actually in December 2017 when we stood in this chamber to agree to a subcommittee. We are coming up to December 2019. It is not good enough for our parliament to not respond to the hundreds of families and all of those who gave evidence. They demand respect from this parliament. People are devastated and people are hurting, and we cannot even give a response, because the government has not even considered it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the short time that I have, I'd like to remind senators of what we reported on, as deputy chair of the PFAS subcommittee, with the chair, Mr Andrew Laming MP. Our report contained significant recommendations, with a focus on improving the government's response to this issue, particularly in relation to the concerns of the affected communities that I have mentioned. The committee recommended that a coordinator-general be appointed with the authority and resources necessary to more effectively coordinate the whole-of-Commonwealth-government effort in respect of PFAS contamination and to ensure a clear and consistent approach to community consultations and cooperation with state, territory and local governments. The committee also made recommendations to improve the voluntary blood testing program as a source of longitudinal information on the long-term health effects of PFAS exposure and the effectiveness of measures to break PFAS exposure pathways. In many instances, property owners in the PFAS-contaminated areas—and we know where they are across this country, and I certainly know where they are in the Northern Territory—have suffered demonstrable and quantifiable financial losses, and the committee recommended compensation. It isn't difficult to respond to those recommendations. It is not good enough that, two years from when we began the subcommittee PFAS inquiry into these concerns across the country, the government still has not responded.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I start, Minister Cormann, I want to share with you a catastrophe that this nation finds itself in. I'm glad that there are some grown-ups across the chamber in Senator Brockman, as well, and Senator Stoker. This is serious stuff. We know there's a slowdown and we know that wages growth is pretty poor, but we have a dilemma in the trucking industry in this nation. We have in this nation a very simple thing called the modern awards. We all know how they work. For years, I have argued with everything that I could get for transport workers to be higher than the modern award, because I don't think it's all that great. Be that as it is may, there is a law of the land that says, 'Thou shalt pay X amount of pesos per hour or whatever it might be, or cents per kilometre in the long distance award,' and no-one argues. You don't argue; we don't argue. Everyone in this nation is touched by road transport. Senator Brockman, your family farm would have had a very close affinity with road transport. There is no argument. Whatever we eat, whatever we wear—you name it—everything comes on the back of a truck. Everything is delivered, except maybe the odd baby here and there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My desk is full of examples of companies not meeting even the basic modern award. Wage theft in this nation is exploding. We've heard some pretty bad examples. There have been some slip-ups from computers—that is Woolworths $300 million—a couple of chefs have been a little shaky in what they've paid, as we know. They're self-nominating and dobbing themselves in, which is great—it's tremendous. But it is exploitation 101 in the road transportation industry. The worst part about the exploitation and wage theft in the road transport industry is the employers themselves. The majority of them are not bad people, but they are having the living daylights squeezed out of them from the top of the supply chain. If you go to employers and say, 'Are you paying your people right?', every employer will say, 'Yep. Everything's cool with me.' They're not going to own up to doing the wrong thing. The truth of the matter is I don't think it's unreasonable for hardworking men and women—whether they are drivers or forkies, whether they are owner-drivers or are employed drivers and employed subcontractors—to be remunerated in accordance with the basic law in this land.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've got examples here. I'm absolutely gobsmacked. Minister Cormann, you need to take this on board, because you have friends in the trucking industry as well. I know who they are, because they're my friends as well. I have one classic example here that cannot go—and this is only one. There are heaps of them. This is a job advertisement on Seek. They're calling out for an HR, which is a heavy rigid, truck driver with ABN. I'll let that sink in. For those who don't know the industrial laws of the land, you cannot have an employee driver with an ABN. It is completely and totally against the law. Sorry, Senator McMahon, this touches your state because of how important road transport is in the Territory. I know because that was my old run—Perth to Darwin—for all those years.</span>

It's entirely important. I am a little bit at a loss to see, or to recall, Senators Gallagher or Wong asking anything about the trucking industry in the course of their questions today, and so I might help you out by bringing you back to what Senators Gallagher and Wong asked about today, and that was the economic indicators that we have in this country. There was a concern expressed, in the course of those questions, about wage growth in this country. It's understandable that people are interested in wage growth. It goes to the take-home pay of all Australians. You'll notice that I'm not getting carried away. I'm not getting cocky. This is serious stuff, things we should not get inflammatory or theatrical about. It matters too much to the lives of Australians for us to be carrying on and scoring political points.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So let's break it down to the facts. We know that inflation over the September quarter has been 1.7 per cent. That's not high. But, importantly, the wage price index exceeds that number. Over the same period, September quarter of 2019, it rose by 2.2 per cent. So what does that mean? Well, it means that while people's wages went up a little, the cost of living went up less. It means that people, in net terms, got a little bit ahead. Did they get a lot ahead? Did they earn a whole lot more than the cost of living went up? They earned a little bit more than the cost of living went up. But the important thing is that growth in wages exceeded inflation. It meant Australians got ahead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Would I like the difference between those two numbers to be greater, so that Australians were earning a whole lot more? Of course I'd like to see Australians earn more, but we should remember that if we have wage growth that enormously outstrips inflation it does have an impact on pushing the price of everything up. So this can become a little bit circular. If we reach the point where, just by having runaway wages, we push up the cost of living enormously it doesn't get Australians ahead. To have a steady-as-she-goes, measured, sensible approach is actually not bad in circumstances where we have other advanced economies facing challenges to wages growth and other advanced economies facing slower growth than they have had across their economy. In circumstances where we face challenges as a nation in relation to dealing with drought, which has enormously hit our rural sector, then we aren't doing too badly against that global picture and against those local challenges.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In that context, it's important to point to the huge investment we have made in infrastructure to help Australian people have access to more work, to see more stimulation of our economy. There has been $100 billion in a pipeline of infrastructure that is to have an enormous impact across this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It isn't just the stimulus that comes from that spending itself but the economic opportunity that is unlocked by the fact of the strategically-chosen projects, because of the way that they empower other businesses to grow, the way that they open up the potential for other projects to grow. And then, once we add to that enormous infrastructure pipeline of projects that are happening now across this country, we can also look to the stimulus effect of drought support in rural communities that are doing it tough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have put forward a record passage of assistance for people who are trying to deal with the impact of drought. Since the last budget, we have committed an additional $355 million to step up yet again our drought response, and that means we can add to the more than a billion dollars since the election. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="AW5" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KIM CARR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:25</span>):  The government has clearly been mugged by economic reality. The government clearly has no plan, has no agenda and is running on fumes. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer assure us all is well and things may even get better. We've heard the Leader of the Government in the Senate today say that, apart from a few international headwinds, it's all pretty good. That's been their line since before the election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The real economy doesn't match their rosy story. Wages are flatlining. So are retail sales. Household debt is not shrinking. The unemployment rate is stuck around five per cent. All of this is happening despite the fact that we have historically record low interest rates and, of course, the much-vaunted tax cuts. The traditional stimulus measures—at least the ones the government has tried—are simply not working. The tax cuts have not resulted in increased consumer spending, companies are not investing in new production, and research and development has fallen away massively. It's no wonder that the Prime Minister has said to his party room that he wanted to get politics off the front page. No wonder he said that he wants ministers to engage less with controversy. It's no wonder that he would want to maintain this fairy tale that this is all going to happen. Mr Morrison and Mr Frydenberg are desperately trying to shut down dissenting voices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most notably, they want to shut down the voice of the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Philip Lowe. We heard today that the government respects the independence of the Reserve Bank. Of course, that's not reflected on the front page of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> today, where the chairman of the government's House of Representatives committee has attacked the Governor of the Reserve Bank. It's part of a consistent pattern of abuse of the Reserve Bank. In a world first for Australia Post, a letter written on Tuesday managed to get to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> within a couple of hours. Talk about express post! Mr Wilson must have walked it around to the editorial suite of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> to get it done in that time!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, for five years we have been told by the Reserve Bank that monetary policy alone cannot rescue this economy from the doldrums. It's called for stimulus measures including investment in infrastructure. We've been told that we should invest in stimulus measures rather than rely on interest rate cuts to make this happen. Of course, this government has sought to nobble the Reserve Bank. They have tried to embarrass and humiliate Mr Lowe by having him appear at press conferences with the Treasurer in a manner which the royal commissioner would never do. The Reserve Bank governor has been nobbled and thugged into making sure he does not comment on economic policy. The mild-mannered Reserve Bank governor, of course, has been put on this government's hit list because he proposes quite clearly reasonable measures in light of the extraordinary economic circumstances. This Treasurer has decided to call Mr Lowe to heel. We now know the consequences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The economic statistics are simply this: the quiet Australians will not remain quiet. The reality in the real economy is that the government's measures are failing. Undermining the Reserve Bank's independence and attempting to silence independent voices will not change the facts when it comes to what families are experiencing, what it really means to have low wages, what it really means to have high increases in the cost of living and what it really means in terms of understanding the economic hardship that's being felt by families right across this country. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a Greens motion to disallow the Gene Technology Amendment (2019 Measures No. 1) Regulations 2019, and I call on senators to support this motion. It is vital that we do so in order to protect our multibillion dollar agricultural export industry and the clean, green reputation of Australian agriculture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments to the gene technology regulations we're seeking to disallow will deregulate the use of a range of new genetic modification techniques in animals, plants and microbes. We fear these changes will have profound impacts on Australia's agricultural exports. This deregulation is reckless and poses huge economic risks to Australia's $48 billion agricultural export industries. It could potentially kill our organic farming industry and massively hamper our traditional agricultural export industry too. Potentially, vast amounts of Australian produce currently guaranteed to be free from GMOs will no longer be so. This is because deregulation means there'll be no tracking of the production or the release of genetically modified organisms created using SDN-1 technology. There'll be no ability to say whether these organisms are present or absent in produce. We will just not know. This is being done without considering the potential dire impacts of this change, the impacts of losing this GMO-free status.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to quote from a letter from the former South Australian Minister for Agriculture, Food and Fisheries which was submitted as part of a consultation process about this change:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">South Australia's non-GM position provides our agricultural producers and food businesses market access in countries where there is demand for non-GM products or products made with non-GM ingredients … our non-GM status is one of the elements which underpin our global reputation as a supplier of premium food and wine from our clean environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, in a media release in support of this motion, Organic Industries said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The organic industry urges all Senators to overturn the Government's deregulation of gene technology. Instead, the Government should consider a proper risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Office of the Gene Technology Regulator assessed this deregulation on a scientific and health basis. But it paid no consideration to the market impact of this deregulation, nor has it properly consulted with the farmers whose livelihoods will be affected. The regulation impact statement that was undertaken by the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator was completely inadequate, with extraordinary and wilful disregard for the risk to billions of dollars of exports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what the impact statement had to say about potential impacts on our exporters:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In this context, non-alignment between Australia and some trading partners appears likely, regardless of the direction of the Technical Review or further developments resulting from the Scheme Review. In the event this occurs, industry would have access to the same mechanisms used to resolve non-alignment issues for other aspects of trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The lack of concern for what they describe as 'non-alignment' is gobsmacking. Non-alignment means our produce will not be able to be certified as being GMO-free in our major export markets. I'm sorry, but the same mechanisms used to resolve non-alignment issues for other aspects of trade will not put the GMO genie back in the bottle, as much as the OGTR may wish and pray it will be able to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our farmers deserve better than this. I spoke with many organic stakeholders who told me loud and clear what 'non-alignment' means to them. For example, I met with an organic wine producer in regional South Australia. He told me about the challenges of guaranteeing that his produce is GMO free. If a genetically modified strain of yeast gets into his wine production, he told me, that will be it. It'll be all over. It will be impossible to remove it. The risk that this has occurred—and he won't know whether it's occurred, because it's not being tracked or monitored—will make it impossible to guarantee that his produce is organic, which means he will not be able to reap the benefits of marketing his wine as organic, GMO-free, quality Australian wine. He told me about the challenges he faces already in ensuring that he can access international markets, working through the Department of Agriculture's processes to ensure that Australian standards match up with the export markets he's trying to sell into, and he says that at the moment he just does not bother to try to sell into markets where there isn't that alignment. It's just too hard. So he is distraught about what the impact of this deregulation is going to be on his business and that no-one has even bothered talking to him about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another example of contamination relates to grasses and weeds. I would like to read a quote from the National Association for Sustainable Agriculture Australia in a media release they put out in support of this disallowance motion. They said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Just one example involves rye grass, a common pasture feed, but in horticulture it is a noxious weed that spreads rapidly. Should a GMO rye grass be released, it could contaminate the entire country in a few short years.</span>
                </p>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Proponents of this deregulation argue that, because the mutations that are created using SDN-1 technology are indistinguishable from natural mutations, the technology is therefore safe. On that point, I would like to read a quote from Professor Heinemann of the University of Canterbury. He says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is a profound difference between what has been genetic engineering using the techniques originating in the 1970s, and which are responsible for the majority of the world's commercially available genetically modified plants, and the genetic engineering that can be done with SDN-1 and dsRNA to any kind of organism. A key difference is that these tools can be liberally used outside leading to simultaneous exposures of all species present. Not just the products of these techniques, but the dsRNA and the editing proteins can be applied at landscape scale out-of-doors by people with very little skill and no or limited knowledge of what the modifications might do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We won't be tracking them. We won't be monitoring them. They will not be regulated. Crucially, Professor Heinemann says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Applications of the SDN-1 technique can lead to modifications to genes or other genetic materials as different as can the treatment with DNA from other species. This is due to the ability to apply them rapidly and repeatedly to the same target area in a genome or to apply them simultaneously to many areas of a genome. Even if all the places damaged by a nuclease are repaired by a "random" process, the cumulative scale of change in sequence would be no different, possibly even larger, than the differences created using transgenic genetic engineering. There is no evidence of which I am aware that other mutagenesis techniques can do this to the same extent and preserve the viability of the modified organism.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the arguments that have been put forward as to why this change is necessary is that it's needed to facilitate medical research, but, first-up, remember we're not saying that SDN-1 technology should be banned; we just want the status quo to remain so that these technologies are regulated and their use is tracked. In contrast to what some may say, there's no consensus amongst medical researchers that deregulation is needed. In its 2016 consultation paper, the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator put forward a number of options. Option 1 was for no change to the regulations, which would have kept SDN-1 technologies captured under the regulations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research submitted that they supported option 1 as it pertained to new technologies. Furthermore, they wrote:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's with other options, including the current deregulatory approach. Similarly, the Victoria University Institutional Biosafety Committee wrote:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">More evidence is needed on all the risks and potential benefits of the new gene technologies and their products, so the Precautionary Principle … should apply.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Likewise, the Children's Medical Research Institute wrote:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Given that CRISPR and other site-directed repair mechanisms all use a directed and targeted gene editing strategy we believe that these technologies should be regulated, even though the mechanism underpinning the technology is a natural repair mechanism.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I want to finish by returning to the huge risk that this deregulation poses to our agricultural export industries and reiterating the likelihood that organic regulators locally and internationally will decide that, since Australia has deregulated this technology, none of our produce can be guaranteed to be free from genetically modified organisms. This will mean that farmers will lose their organic certifications, and without those certifications the organics industry will collapse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Europe already says that these new technologies are genetic modification technologies, so the risk is that, unless we disallow this regulation, countries such as China and the countries of the European Union could reject our exports. The government and the Labor Party have said that because the states have signed up on these changes they should go ahead, but I question how well informed the states are in their support for deregulation. How practical is it going to be to maintain a state based moratorium, such as Tasmania says it's going to do, when no-one is tracking these organisms?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our national government spends millions on ensuring biosecurity at the national border, facing challenges like African swine fever. Are the states well enough resourced to track organisms that have no registration and that are not being tracked or monitored? It is ludicrous to think that this is going to occur. Tasmania recently extended its GMO moratorium for a further 10 years, but they will not be able to remain GMO free when these GMO organisms are being produced and distributed across the country, unregulated and untracked.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian agricultural exports to China alone are a nearly-$12-billion industry, covering a huge sweep of agricultural commodities. So there is huge concern that farmers are going to lose access to these export markets, and the government has not allayed these concerns. What is the reason for the government feeling the need to rush this through? Why is the ALP supporting the government in doing this? It seems to me like a pretty clear-cut case of the excessive influence of big business—in this case, the big biotech companies. They are the ones who are going to benefit from this deregulation. They are the ones with the patents on the technologies. They are the ones who make the big donations to both the Liberal and Labor parties and who have platoons of lobbyists here at Parliament House to keep currying favour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens believe that the safe and prudent thing to do is to continue to treat the new technologies like the other genetic technologies covered by the Gene Technology Act. It is absurd that that's not going to be the case. We're not talking about imposing new regulations or obligations on these technologies, and we're not talking about stopping the use of these technologies. We're simply asking to retain the status quo and to keep them under the existing regulatory regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate must disallow these changes in order for a proper examination of the issues at stake here to proceed. We need to understand what impact this will have on our organic farmers, on our farmers who benefit from being GMO free and on our broader communities.</span>

                    </a>  I am listening—very much so. It is strange that some people who might be happy to endorse the science on climate change show less regard to the scientific evidence and the rational inquiry on other matters such as gene technology. Genetic modification is a term which, of course, in some quarters, causes great alarm, but it is a name for progress that humans have been engaged in for many thousands of years. It's the history of agriculture, which has long involved genetic modification. It's the process of altering organisms' genetic make-up, and, of course, it happens in the selective breeding of plants and of animals. It is how drought-resistant and pest-resistant crops have been developed. It is how the nutritional yields of foods have improved enormously. GMs take place in the laboratory rather than in the paddock. It is a principle no different from what has happened in selective breeding. What we have here is more precise than the traditional methods have been, in terms of similar goals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In much more than 20 years of commercial use, the scientific consensus is that GM techniques have posed no greater risk to human health or the environment than similar products derived from traditional breeding or selection processes. That's the scientific consensus—and I'm referring to the assessments from the World Health Organization, the Royal Society of London and the United States National Academy of Sciences. There is no natural order that is being destroyed or disrupted. There is no Dr Frankenstein's monster that is being fabricated. There are no monstrous creatures being created in the dead of night.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have here is the situation where humanity, for centuries, has been developing better products, and, of course, better strains of food and of animals, and that is still the case. The difference now is that modern technology gives us the capabilities that selective breeding in the past had not. In modern GM technology, gene functions can be added, deleted or turned off. Specific genes that determine particular traits can be implanted into another organism. That is then referred to specifically as a genetically modified organism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That occurs not just in agriculture. That's the situation that occurs in medical advances, where the progress has been absolutely enormous. GM technology has been used to produce new vaccines, new antivenenes and new antibodies. Insulin, used for the treatment of diabetes, has been synthesised using GM bacteria. People ask, 'What's the use of this stuff?' Insulin! It's not just the major pharmaceutical companies that benefit from insulin; it's hundreds of thousands of Australians that benefit from the medical advances that come from this science! As to the product of insulin, I suggest that there might be a few senators that use this stuff every day.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This process is significantly more efficient than the previous methods, which involved the extraction of animal insulin from cows and pigs. This process saves lives. It's appropriate that we ensure the proper regulation of scientific processes through the Therapeutic Goods Administration, just as we do with food, through Food Standards Australia New Zealand, and various organisms, through the agriculture organisations of the UN. Gene technology is a regulated process, and ensuring human safety is one reason that you have to have proper regulations in place. That's why regulations need to be revised from time to time to take into account new developments. The new regulations that Senator Rice, I'm sorry to say, is seeking to have us ignore are overseen by the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator. They are regulations which classify organisms classified by immune technologies as GMOs. They exclude the GMO organism SDN-1. That is because the regulator found that SDN-1 organisms are indistinguishable from naturally occurring genetic changes and present no higher risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The exclusion has been the subject of campaigns by Friends of the Earth and other groups who have a moral objection to GMOs. They have a moral objection to the use of science in this way. They claim that SDNs have not been proved to be safe and there could be unintended consequences for the food supply, animals and the environment. Well, the regulator has responded. There is no evidence that SDN-1 is harmful. I repeat: these organisms are indistinguishable from organisms that occur naturally. The food supply will not be disrupted. It will continue to be regulated by the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code. If this disallowance motion is passed, it will put at risk and impose quite dangerous restrictions on the ability to regulate properly. It will undermine the capacity for research and development. It will undermine the capacity for innovation, particularly in regard to medicine. SDN-1 techniques, which include the CRISPR technology, are crucial to the development of new cancer treatments and vaccines. Who do they benefit? They benefit Australians. They benefit hundreds of thousands of Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are echoes here of what we hear from some quarters about the development of nuclear technology for medical purposes. Of course, the people concerned are only too happy to enjoy the benefits of radiopharmacology when they get cancer. We have to ensure that their advice is not followed when it comes to an action such as has been proposed by Senator Rice. We need to take into account the danger to future medical innovations that the passing of this disallowance motion would create, because this attitude to GMO is formed not on the basis of evidence but on the basis of prejudice. The fundamental proposition advanced is that there is a moral objection to this science. We hear it, for instance, from the National Association for Sustainable Agriculture, who say, 'GMOs of any kind and organics simply don't mix.'</span>

The fact is they save lives and they produce food for hungry people. This is not science fiction and it's certainly not the fantasies that are pedalled by those who support this disallowance motion. This is real science, which is why the new regulatory framework has been supported by the Australian Academy of Science and the Australian National University. It is why it's supported by industry bodies such as the Grains Research and Development Corporation. It is why the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator rejects the assertion of Friends of the Earth that the regulations will undermine Australia's status as a world leader in organic food production. It rejects it because it's simply not true. The regulator stated:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian regulatory framework for gene technology was established at a time when the technology was new, the risks were poorly defined, and there were few commercial products.

Senators should reflect carefully on the advice when they vote on this motion. Does the Senate want to take an evidence based approach to decisions on gene technology, an approach that reflects the development of techniques in genetic science over the last two decades, developments that will continue to allow appropriate regulations to protect human safety, or do we want to succumb to the ideological resistance to genetic technologies being pushed by organisations like Friends of the Earth? If we want to build an enlightened future for this country, a future that does not reject science, we should reject this motion. The new gene technology regulations should be upheld.</span>

While it is a low-risk technique, we accept there are potentially significant trade impacts relating to the new regulation for Australian exports to nations with stricter regulatory regimes, especially for organic and non-GMO marketed products. We note that the most recent decision from the European Court of Justice affirmed that all SDN techniques, including SDN-1, are considered to be genetic modification techniques and, as such, are required to be regulated under the obligations of the EU's GMO directive. We also note that Tasmanian Premier Will Hodgman and Tasmania's Minister for Primary Industries and Water, Guy Barnett, have both said that the state will specifically regulate the use of SDN-1-modified organisations in order to protect Tasmania's GMO-free reputation.</span>

I really never thought I would rise in this place and say this. I doubt I'll ever say it again, but it's good to be able to say it at least once, Senator Carr. I certainly will not cover the territory that you have covered. I probably would have said it in slightly more moderate tones, but I agree with everything that you stated. We face in this country a need to improve agricultural productivity. We're currently in the midst of drought, particularly on the east coast, though there are also some issues in Western Australia. We're seeing international competition from trading partners into what we once considered our natural markets. We're seeing productivity not increase at the pace we need it to to meet the world's demand for food and fibre. In order to achieve these things, we need a fourth agricultural revolution. We need a new green revolution—not the sort of green revolution that's indicated by the political party but a green revolution in terms of our productivity. We need to embrace techniques such as these genetic modification techniques in order to supply the world with the food and fibre it needs going forward.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will just raise not the techniques covered by these regulations but some of the older genetic modification techniques that have been used so successfully in the cotton industry. They reduced pesticide usage in cotton crops by 90 per cent. You would think that the Greens would be jumping up and down and celebrating the reduction in the use of pesticides by 90 per cent. But, because of the ideological campaign against these techniques, against genetic modification in principle, we see them argue against it. There has been much raised of risk to the international trading environment. I will point out, in the very few seconds I have remaining, that Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the United States have all excluded SDN-1 from the scope of their regulation, and a number of other countries are doing the same.</span>

I've submitted a notice of disallowance, which was on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> for today, and it winds up tomorrow. There are two other disallowance notices on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> that take the debate on this through to November, so I am in no way resiling from the fact that this restraints instrument needs improvement and that we need to address the issue of restraints. Senator Colbeck, I know, is currently considering these issues. I want to enable time for a fuller discussion on this regulation, so I'm withdrawing this so that we can have that debate and then have the debate around the disallowance when it comes up again later in this month.</span>

We know the issues, we have seen the evidence and it is this government that is actually doing something about it. We have given the regulators more funding and more powers. We have increased the penalties for non-compliance. We have laws before the Senate to prevent the improper use of worker benefits and to recover unpaid superannuation. We are drafting tough new laws to criminalise wage theft and we are consulting on even more penalties, powers and tools for the courts to crack down on employers who don't give their employees what they are owed. Action is what's needed and action is precisely what is happening.</span>

                  </a>  All Australians can be proud of the amazing success of our female athletes. The last two years have seen landmark achievements for women in cricket, soccer, AFL, rugby, netball and basketball. We have seen improved pay and conditions for women in many sports, and record crowds are turning out to support our female athletes. The government believes that achieving sustainable pay requires buy-in across the entire sport ecosystem, which includes organisations, news, media, fans and broadcasters. The government is doing its bit by investing in initiatives to increase women's participation in sport through leadership programs; funding accessible, safe and inclusive sporting infrastructure; and boosting broadcasting of women's sport to help build audiences.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The purpose of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Amendment (Tax Transparency in Procurement and Grants) Bill 2019 is to reform Commonwealth procurement rules to place greater knowledge and transparency arrangements on government agencies entering into contracts with companies that are, or have related entities, domiciled in recognised tax havens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The law will also introduce similar measure into arrangements for the provision of grants by Commonwealth entities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has declared its desire to combat multinational tax avoidance. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">However there have to date been no measures to provide the government with information on the foreign tax arrangements of companies seeking to contract with the Commonwealth to provide goods or services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Nor have government departments and agencies been obliged to consider the tax arrangements of companies in the tender process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, there have been no public reporting requirements for government departments and agencies entering into contracts with companies that are, or have related entities, domiciled in recognised tax havens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The same deficiencies in information collection, consideration and reporting also apply in regard to the entities that receive grants from Commonwealth Government agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As a consequence there is no effective transparency in relation to government contractors or grant recipients that are, or have parent companies, domiciled in tax havens – for example, the Cayman Islands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While there may be a wide range of legitimate reasons for companies to make offshore tax arrangements, including in recognised tax havens, there is a strong public interest in ensuring taxation transparency from entities that receive taxpayer funds, whether through government contracts or grants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill will remedy these very obvious deficiencies in the Australian Government's procurement arrangements and grants schemes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will amend the <span style="font-style:italic;">Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 </span>to require the responsible Minister to prescribe foreign countries or parts thereof as tax havens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In determining whether a country or area should be designated as a tax haven, the Minister will be required to consult with the Commissioner of Taxation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Minister will be required to publish a notice setting out the country, or the part of the country, the Minister proposes to prescribe; and invite interested parties to make submissions about the proposed prescription. The Minister must have regard to advice and submissions received before deciding to prescribe a tax haven.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This process will ensure that the Minister's decision is based on independent expert advice from the Commissioner of Taxation and provides the opportunity for input from any interested parties, which may include representatives of the country in question or companies domiciled in that country or area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will further establish three key requirements for both procurement and grants – a disclosure requirement, a consideration requirement and a publication requirement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The disclosure requirement will mandate that a company responding to a Commonwealth Government tender where the offered price for goods or services exceeds $4 million (or $7.5 million for construction services) will need to disclose whether the company, or any of its related entities, are domiciled in a tax haven.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These thresholds ensure that the taxation transparency arrangements will only apply to major public procurement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A supplier or grant applicant will also be required to give details of foreign entities that might not otherwise be available on account of the secrecy laws normally encountered in tax haven jurisdictions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The consideration requirement will require officials to consider, in consultation with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), any additional risks that a company, or any of its related entities being domiciled in a tax haven, may have on tax avoidance and transparency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The publication requirement will impose an obligation on agencies that award contracts to companies that are, or have related entities, domiciled in a tax haven to publish the number of contracts and the total value of contracts in their annual reports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Similar requirements will also apply to the award of grants by Commonwealth agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will not make it unlawful or otherwise prevent the award of contracts or the provision of grants to companies and entities that have tax haven links. However it will establish a much-needed transparency scheme and impose additional due diligence requirements on officials to ensure that the public interest is properly weighed in Australian Government contracting and grants processes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australian taxpayers have a right to know if any significant amount of taxpayer money is being given to entities with tax haven links. They have a right to expect that Australian Government procurement will take into account international taxation issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This law will achieve these objectives, and the information that flows into the public domain will inform policy makers and public debate about further measures that may be required to strengthen Australia's efforts to combat multinational taxation avoidance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

Section 23(1)(a) of the exposure draft of the mandatory dairy code of conduct bans contracts from having clauses which retrospectively reduce the prices paid to farmers in any circumstances. This is in line with the principles announced on 15 March 2019 and with clause 22 in the draft clauses for a dairy code released in January 2019. Our government stands with our dairy farmers, which is why we are committed to a mandatory dairy code of conduct as requested by Australian dairy farmers.</span>

                    <span style="font-style:italic;">The speech read as follows—</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill amends the <span style="font-style:italic;">Governor-General Act 1974</span> (the Act) to stop paying standard allowances to former Governors-General, and their spouses, when they have engaged in serious misconduct. There are currently no mechanisms within the Act to end allowances when such a payment is no longer in the public interest, for instance when a former Governor-General has engaged in unconscionable or illegal behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill provides two avenues for ceasing to pay allowances. Firstly, the Minister may make a declaration through a legislative instrument to end allowances to a former Governor-General, or their spouse, where they have engaged in serious misconduct. The Ministerial declaration must set out the person the declaration applies to, the reasons for making the declaration and a summary of the information considered in the process. A declaration is not affected by when the Governor-General was in office, or when or where the misconduct took place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The second avenue permits a House of Parliament to pass a resolution declaring that a former Governor-General, or their spouse, cease to be paid an allowance because a former Governor-General have engaged in serious misconduct. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Similar provisions for ceasing entitlements to former Governors already exist in state and territory legislation. In Queensland, under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Governors (Salary and Pensions) Act 2003</span>, a former Governor may have their entitlement ceased if a tribunal makes a finding that the Governor misbehaved in a way that justifies ending the entitlement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For the purposes of this Bill, serious misconduct involves inappropriate, improper, wrong or unlawful conduct. Examples of serious misconduct could include corruption, harassment, abuse, theft, fraud and other criminal behaviour. The Bill outlines that serious misconduct also includes an omission to act. I think it is significant that we include an omission to act in the definition of serious misconduct because it sends a clear signal to people in power that the cover up of abuse and illegal behaviour is never acceptable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Governor-General is a political figurehead within our system, performing both constitutional and ceremonial duties. Under current convention, the Prime Minister is responsible for providing advice on the appointment of the Governor-General.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As we have seen in the past, there have been limited checks and balances on these appointments. Under the Act, former Governors-General are entitled to a retirement allowance for life after they cease to hold office. The retirement allowance is paid at 60% of the current salary Chief Justice of the High Court. Today, this is equivalent to $360,000 a year in retirement allowances. Following the death of a serving or retired Governor-General, their spouse is entitled to an allowance for life at five-eighths of the rate of a former Governor-General. This is a significant amount of money funded by the taxpayer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to a retirement allowance, former Governors-General are entitled to post-employment benefits including the provision of office facilities, administrative support and transport. These entitlements are administered through the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. In 2018, over $13 million was provided in non-cash benefits to former Governors-General on top of their retirement allowances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under the current legislative framework, a former Governor-General or their spouse will continue to receive retirement allowances even when they have engaged in serious misconduct. For example, they may have been convicted and imprisoned for a crime and would continue to remain eligible. This represents a clear oversight in legislation that should be rectified.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill aims to introduce accountability and transparency to the expenditure of public money for the payment of pensions and allowances to former Governors-General. Our Government should not continue to pay such significant allowances, worth millions of dollars, where it is no longer in the public interest to do so. It is important that people who hold public office are held accountable. They should not be able to engage in misconduct or in unlawful activity and still continue to receive government-funded entitlements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Our efforts to introduce accountability mechanisms to these allowances have been championed by the work of abuse survivors and their advocates. I would like to take a moment to recognise their tireless work in shining a light on this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Many survivors of abuse are of the view that former Governors-General who have acted unconscionably or illegally should not receive ongoing government-funded entitlements. Survivors are calling for action from our politicians, not just words, as important as they are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Last year, a coalition of groups wrote to the Prime Minister asking him to amend the Act to cease payment of public money to former Governors-General. This group included Bravehearts, the Blue Knot Foundation, Care Leavers Australasia Network, End Rape on Campus, Beyond Abuse and the Queensland Child Sexual Abuse Legislative Reform Council.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the letter they wrote:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">"At a time when ordinary Australians are working harder than ever, with energy, petrol and food prices constantly rising, and the tax payer bearing the burden of the enormous cost of untreated child abuse it is not in the public interest that the tax payer continue to also fund a person who has betrayed the public trust in their previous role as an institutional leader."</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I would like to reiterate my admiration for the courage of survivors of institutional child sexual abuse and their strong support for survivors' ongoing pursuit of justice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Taking action will help ensure the people and institutions who shielded abusers face the consequences of their actions. We know that the cover up of abuse in institutional settings allowed the sexual abuse of children to continue, causing further trauma and harm to children. People who held public office and played a part in covering up sexual abuse must be held accountable. This Bill is a part of ongoing efforts to achieve this. Public pressure alone won't be enough to strip former Governors-General of their generous entitlements. It is time to put legislation in place to ensure they are held accountable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I am urging all parties to take a serious look at how we are supporting survivors of abuse in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is still significant work to be done to support abuse survivors, including implementation of all of the recommendations from the Royal Commission into Institutionalised Responses to Child Sexual Abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is urgent work that needs to be done on fixing the National Redress Scheme to ensure it is as extensive, functional and effective as possible. The scheme has been plagued by delays in claims being processed and difficulties getting institutions to join the scheme. The reality is that survivors of sexual abuse are passing away before their claims for redress are processed. The Government must take this seriously and do everything it can to ensure the Redress Scheme is working as intended.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Thankfully progress is being made in some areas for survivors, and I think it's also important to celebrate these legislative achievements. In October, the Queensland Parliament passed legislation that extends the definition of abuse to include serious physical and psychological abuse. The legislation also sets aside the statute of limitations for these survivors to pursue civil claims. These changes will help hold institutions accountable and improve access to justice for abuse survivors in Queensland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill represents an important step towards redress for the survivors of abuse. It sends a clear message that no one is above the law and abusers and those who protect abusers must be held accountable. I urge you to consider this Bill, not only from a public accountability perspective, but also as a way of achieving healing, closure and justice for survivors of sexual abuse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We must continue to break the culture of secrecy and silence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I commend this Bill to the Senate.</span>

                  </a>  In August 1991 Labor communications minister Kim Beazley said he was 'getting a bit tired of the campaign regarding ABC funding'. 'Whatever is occurring inside the ABC is a product of choices it is taking itself,' he said. The ABC has let us down, yet everyday Australians can access the Olympics in many other ways. A recent ABC efficiency study identified a number of areas for significant operational savings without affecting programs. To everyday Australians, this sounds more like the inability of ABC managers to manage than a need to cut programs. The ABC should look to its own backyard first. It should not condone the pro-violence opinions expressed on <span style="font-style:italic;">Q&amp;A</span> last week calling for political violence, including murder and arson. The ABC is not exempt from delivering an efficient service, and whatever is occurring inside the ABC is a product of choices it is taking itself. We oppose this motion.</span>

This will have a devastating impact on nearly 5,000 Victorians employed in the native forest industry, as well as their families and the regional communities that rely on this industry. The industry is well managed and sustainable and our government is committed to supporting both the strong plantation and the native forest sector. The Andrews Labor government should listen to the workers and regional communities and reverse this decision.</span>

                  </a>  The government notes its utmost appreciation for the heroic efforts of emergency service personnel at this difficult time. The government has a targeted strategy to reduce the risk of natural disasters and build resilience in communities in the form of the Natural Disaster Risk Reduction Framework. The government is continuing to implement this framework. There are longstanding disaster recovery arrangements in place between the Commonwealth and the states to ensure an adequate response to disasters and to assist communities in recovery. The government will always stand with its communities affected by bushfires and natural disasters. It's disappointing that the Greens are using these tragic fires as an opportunity to try to score political points.</span>

                  </a>  Labor will not be supporting this motion. We did approach the Greens to amend this motion into a form that we could support, but we were unable to reach agreement with them. We had been seeking to find a common ground on these devastating bushfires, because we believe that's what Australians want us to do and what they expect from their politicians. Regrettably, some have been deliberately seeking to score political points, and we won't engage in that kind of behaviour while families are grieving, communities are in danger and courageous Australians are fighting these fires. But we do believe that it is the responsible thing to do, when we are through this immediate crisis, to focus on what we have to do to keep Australians safe, with climate change making Australia's fire seasons longer and more intense.</span>

                  </a>  This story was, of course, confronting. Animal welfare and the regulation of the racing industry are the responsibility of the states. Queensland has established an inquiry into the abattoir and the wider treatment of racehorses. The Australian government is investigating alleged animal cruelty at the abattoir, as it's export registered. Agriculture ministers have called on state racing ministers to consider the establishment of a national racehorse register. Ministers also commissioned a review of the Australian Animal Welfare Standards and Guidelines for the land transport of livestock in respect of horses. What can be done appropriately by the Commonwealth is already being done.</span>

We agree that the images and evidence of animal cruelty are confronting and appalling, and we're deeply concerned that animal welfare failings have occurred with retired racehorses. However, there are a number of investigations and reviews underway, and the associated industries are working to ensure that systems are put in place to address the current failings. It's important to give these investigations and reviews the opportunity to do what they need to do and that the findings are made public to ensure that welfare standards are implemented and adhered to.</span>

The government has passed tougher laws to better protect vulnerable workers, has boosted the resources of the regulator and has commenced work on implementing the recommendations of the Migrant Workers' Taskforce, including drafting new criminal penalties for the worst forms of worker exploitation. Labor went to the last election with a 310-page policy platform containing over 100 mentions of unions, $387 billion of higher taxes and precisely zero references to either a migrant workers task force or criminal penalties for wage theft.</span>

                  </a>  The Australian government is already fulfilling the core of this motion by building water infrastructure throughout Australia, including in Queensland. The government has $3.5 billion in grants and loans for water infrastructure projects. We commend the Queensland LNP leader, Deb Frecklington, for raising the need for new water infrastructure in Queensland and, by doing so, forcing the Queensland Premier to open her eyes to the possibilities. This government has established the National Water Grid Authority, which will consider options for developing large-scale water capture and transfer schemes such as those proposed in this motion, and others. We're committed to building water infrastructure to grow our agricultural sector, and to improve stock and domestic supply and, importantly, flood mitigation and droughtproofing, and we'll work with any state government to do so. Therefore, there is no reason for the Australian government to oppose this motion.</span>

                  </a>  I support the building of dams, but I do not support expensive and wasteful boondoggles that are designed to change the climate. A little known fact is that JJC Bradfield's original scheme was to pump water into Central Australia in the hope of altering Australia's climate. I have stood against climate change schemes which waste taxpayer dollars pumping water through mountain ranges, over mountain ranges or, indeed, up to the Snowy Mountains scheme so it can run back down again. That is a complete waste of taxpayer money. Build dams, but don't build schemes that are uneconomic, unviable, unsustainable and will not alter the climate one jot or one tittle in this country.</span>

                  </a>  Labor can't support the motion in its current form, because it calls on the government to take steps to ensure the construction of a yet-to-be-proposed scheme. There is no detail on what it is. Water infrastructure must be well thought through because projects can have serious consequences for Australian farmers and communities and our environment, which is why we have the assessment process to determine if projects will work not and if they will deliver what our communities need to cope with drought and to support local economies. We have to get this stuff right. Labor notes that this government promised to build 100 dams but has built not one in six years, and the Morrison government has no plan for the country.</span>

                  </a>  For decades, statutory authorities, government organisations and independent researchers have all debunked the scheme on scientific, engineering and financial grounds. Yet, despite this overwhelming rejection, the Bradfield scheme is revived every few years, only to be rejected once more. This grandiose pipedream to turn the rivers inland and cure the drought gets trotted out so often that the ABC has a standing Fact Check page debunking it. After examining the scheme and consulting with a range of experts, they rate the proposal as 'pie in the sky'. Drought conditions in my home state of Queensland are absolutely heartbreaking, with 66 per cent of the state drought declared. Much of the state is on fire, and lack of water is hampering firefighting efforts. But the answer is not a fanciful, massively-subsidised engineering project that won't work. We need to listen to the science. We need to stop mining companies monopolising water resources. And we need to get serious about addressing the climate crisis that is intensifying the drought and the fires.</span>

                  </a>  Once again we are here, where the government is denying consideration of a very important foreign policy matter. Kashmiris have been living under curfew for months now. Over one million Kashmiri children are still out of school. The Australian government must use all diplomatic means available to call on the Indian government to reverse its decision to remove the autonomy of Kashmir. They must release political prisoners, lift the curfew and allow freedom of movement, communication, speech and assembly for the people of Kashmir. The Australian government must call on the Indian government to respect Kashmiris' right to self-determination. Kashmiris have the right to live their lives free from violence, free from militarisation, free from curfews and free to have freedom of speech.</span>

                  </a>  In line with the government's longstanding view, motions that cannot be debated or amended should not deal with complex foreign policy matters. The Australian government's position is that the Kashmir dispute is a bilateral matter for India and Pakistan to resolve peacefully through dialogue. No durable or resilient peace can be obtained through military means. We note that Prime Minister Modi has said that the current security and governance arrangements are temporary, and has promised to restore statehood to Jammu and Kashmir. The government urges India and Pakistan to find a peaceful political, bilateral solution.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:33</span>):  I rise to raise my concerns about this coalition government's lack of care for regional Australia. The government's failure is twofold. The Morrison Liberal-National government is failing regional areas. It is failing the jobs test; it is not creating jobs in Australia's rural and regional areas. It is failing in the education space for people living in rural and regional areas. People living in rural and regional areas deserve the same opportunities to access skills training and apprenticeships. This government is not delivering on the commitment it made at the last federal election, and the Australian people deserve to know why.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To prepare the regional workforce for jobs of the future, skills must align with the skills of the future. Sadly, under the Morrison government, TAFE and regional jobs are under attack. Tasmania and Australia cannot afford to delay investing in the jobs of the future. Government must build with the private sector a framework for future jobs in the service, agriculture and tourism sectors. These sectors are particularly valuable to my home state of Tasmania. We have been very proud of what we have achieved over the decades, but that is at risk under this government. The government talk the talk about jobs, jobs, jobs, but we have not seen the jobs manifest themselves in Tasmania. What we have in fact seen is over 5,200 Tasmanians lose their jobs. They are full-time jobs that have gone, and we've also seen casualisation and underemployment. What I know is that I can't hold my breath waiting for the Liberals' Tasmanian team to be the voice of reason in the Morrison government. We had a new federal member elected at the May election, and she's missing in action. She has not delivered on one commitment that was outlined at the May federal election. She is in hiding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's the same with the health system in rural and regional areas, particularly in Tasmania. The Launceston General Hospital is in crisis. We have ambulances ramping. We're threatened with losing our most valuable resource, our medical fraternity. The doctors, the nurses, the ward clerks, the other hospital staff—they are all under stress because we have a Liberal state minister and a Liberal federal minister who have gone missing in action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals' Senate team and this Morrison government are planning on ripping more federal Public Service jobs out of Tasmania as they privatise the visa-processing system. This means 2,000 jobs across Australia, 100 jobs in Hobart alone, will go.</span>

                  </a>  That is a fact. Yet those opposite argue that they are the champions of jobs. Well, those on the other side of this chamber, who have the honour of being part of government, have a responsibility to build opportunities with the private sector to create jobs, not to destroy them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government talk big on vocational training and jobs, but, instead of investing in TAFE and jobs, they're gutting the TAFE system. This is nowhere more apparent than in Tasmania, where there's been a loss of jobs and apprenticeships. We know that over $3 billion has been cut out of TAFE. That is not good enough. We need more investment in apprentices and vocational training. From all the evidence thus far, my home state of Tasmania is under threat. We have this 'pipeline of new jobs and investment' but no plan for ensuring that it's carried on in the long term. We are short of tradespeople, yet we see this government gutting and cutting the TAFE sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite promised so much at the federal election but they have delivered nothing but job losses in Tasmania. In Northern Tasmania, wages have gone backwards by more than $3 an hour. Jobs and pay in general are stagnating, but we are actually going backwards. It is an indictment of this federal government. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:38</span>):  I'll first say, in rising today to speak on this MPI, that I must have woken up this morning in a parallel universe. I thought that Labor had spent the last few months denouncing themselves over just how out of touch with regional and rural Australia they are. Didn't their own internal election review say that Labor's spending announcements and tax policies fuelled anxiety among people in outer urban and regional Australia that Labor would crash the economy and risk their jobs? Didn't their review find that outer metropolitan, provincial and rural Australia swung against Labor? Now they want to come into this chamber and lecture the government on what is best for regional and rural Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Isn't Labor the party that just announced a ban on native forestry in Victoria—a ban which will cost thousands of jobs in regional communities? What's worse is the Victorian Labor government deliberately released that policy on the exact same day that Labor released its federal election review, to give itself some cover from negative press attention. You couldn't get a better example of the complete mess and the absolute hypocrisy that is the Labor Party: the Victorian Labor Party announced a policy to kill off thousands of jobs in the regional communities and used, as cover, a federal Labor review that found Labor is out of touch with regional Australia. And what was the coalition government doing on that exact same day last week? We were announcing a billion-dollar expansion of our drought assistance measures for rural and regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Prime Minister has said, helping our farmers in regional communities is a top policy priority of this government. We have a comprehensive policy agenda to support the regions—an agenda which was endorsed by voters, particularly in regional Australia. It is an agenda that we are already delivering on, including a plan for agriculture backed by $4 billion in funding; a record investment of $100 billion in infrastructure projects across our country, with a heavy focus on regional roads and rail; additional funding for the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund; the $550 million Stronger Rural Health Strategy; and delivering new trade agreements which will allow the produce and products from regional Australia to get to new markets—creating jobs and investment at home. We're backing in forestry, mining and fisheries—all industries which will create jobs in regional Australia, and industries towards which Labor vacillates between being lukewarm at best to downright hostile at worst.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As one Labor frontbencher recently said about the current party, Labor is 'too quick to dismiss people with opposing views as obviously wrong, probably stupid and possibly subhuman'. Where will you find a large proportion of people with opposing views to Labor—those people that, according to one of their own, they treat as 'stupid and possibly subhuman'? You will find them in regional Australia. So, please, give us a spell from the Labor lectures about what regional Australia wants, when this coalition government has a clear plan and is already investing in these areas. In my own state of Tasmania, we are seeing significant investment in agriculture and in Battery of the Nation. We are putting $100 million into irrigation to ensure that our farmers will continue to thrive. We have a plan and we are delivering on that plan—and I'm sick of being lectured by those on the other side that can't seem to see the reality of our hard work.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:42</span>):  The island where I live and that I have the fortune to represent in this place, Tasmania, is a large, rural and regional electorate. Contrary to probably what many Australians believe, it is very vulnerable, like the rest of rural and regional Australia, to drought and to bushfires. In the last five summers, we've had three of the worst fires on record that have burned in areas where fires have never been seen, including up through our World Heritage areas, in our alpine areas and our rainforests, on the west coast. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We learnt from the 2016 fires that Tasmania didn't have the resources on hand to immediately tackle these fires—as we also learnt from this summer. My colleague Senator McKim and I initiated a Senate inquiry following the 2016 fires in Tasmania, and we also initiated a Senate inquiry in a committee that I know you have spent a lot of time in, Acting Deputy President Fawcett—the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade—that looked at the role of the Australian Defence Force in being better able to assist around a climate emergency. What came out of that committee inquiry and the evidence that we heard from witnesses was a policy, which we launched in 2016 and re-launched in 2018 following the second Senate inquiry, with the Greens committing $500 million to rural and regional Australia for a national disaster response unit. We were the first to come to this place and talk about the need for a whole revamp of the way the federal government interacts with the states around national disasters. This would have been a specialised remote natural disaster operation support capacity for the states and territories, coordinated by the federal government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This would have covered procurement of an aerial firefighting fleet of fixed-wing and helicopter aircraft to provide direct firefighting capacity. The NDRU would also provide supervision, incident observation, fire mapping and intelligence functions. The fleet would have the flexibility to work in diverse terrain and multiple disaster events. $280 million of that $500 million would go directly into the NDRU's fleet, which could fund up to two large air tankers, five medium air tankers, four light-attack aircraft firefighters and three supervision aircraft, with a combined capacity of almost 150,000 litres. We learnt in the inquiry that we farm out and bring in many of our aircraft from overseas. We have learnt the hard lesson in recent days that some of these fleets aren't available, because fire seasons all around the world aren't as coordinated as they used to be. They are earlier—indeed, they're all year round—and it's very difficult to get these assets. As part of the national agency's setup, it would establish clear lines of responsibility with all relevant state and territory authorities. Just today the Queensland Premier called for more federal coordination and federal investment in exactly this kind of disaster response unit, which could be funded and coordinated by the federal government across all states.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the kinds of things we need to be looking at in the future that we are entering—a future of climate change, a future of climate emergency. A government's No. 1 role and responsibility is to protect its citizens. We heard during the Senate inquiry that climate change is one of the biggest threats to our national security. Indeed, previous US President Obama said climate change was the biggest threat to US national security. In terms of the imminent threat, the loss of life, the loss of property, the disruption to communities and the damage to the lives of everyday Australians, I would argue there is no bigger threat than our changing climate and the emergency that that poses. Yet we find funding has been pulled in New South Wales, emergency services have been defunded, Parks and Wildlife have been defunded and the Tasmanian government still hasn't been able to get a remote firefighting capability together after three summers in five years of the most devastating fires we've seen. If the government were true to its word that it wants to protect Australians and protect our national security, it's about time for it to look at exactly this kind of proposal. Put funding into the exact capabilities that we need so we are ready and able to meet the challenges when they arise. Unfortunately and sadly, scientists tell us we will be seeing a lot more of this all year round in this country in the immediate future unless we take strong action on climate change.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:47</span>):  I am sad to have to participate in the debate this afternoon on a matter of public importance with regard to the failure of the coalition government to deliver for rural and regional Australia. So much of Australia's identity resides in our belief in the great people in the rural and regional parts of this country—their resilience and their capacity. But what they face is a government that does not stand with them—not practically, though perhaps in word—but is absent. This is a government that continues to deny that it is mismanaging this country and this economy and that it is not serving the people of the bush. They have no plan. Perhaps most egregiously, the headline figure of $7 billion that the government continues to sprout as the amount that was supporting the drought has been found to be a complete misrepresentation of what was going on. That's just the beginning. Let me count just some more of the ways in which this government has failed to deliver for rural and regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just start with the ABC cuts and the impact that that is going to have on people in regional Australia. The ABC bought the rights for the Olympic Games, and it brought that wonderful event into the households of Australia for almost 70 years. But after years of cuts at the hands of the Liberal National government, and with a further three years of cuts ahead for the ABC, they've been left with no choice. The ABC has decided to end its 67-year run as the official non-commercial Olympic Games radio broadcaster. Budget pressures and competing budget priorities have been cited by the ABC as critical reasons for it not continuing this great tradition. The ABC warned that the latest round of budget cuts, totalling $83.7 million over the next three years, would make it very difficult for them to meet the charter requirements and audience expectations. But Scott Morrison locked in—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator O'NEILL:</span>
                  </a>  Mr Morrison, the Prime Minister of Australia, the leader of the Liberal-National government, happily locked in $83.7 million worth of cuts to the ABC. As a result of the decision of the Prime Minister of this country, Australians will miss out on this much-loved content that is part of Australia's media, sporting and cultural identity. This will hit hard in country and remote areas, particularly where the ABC Radio broadcast is often the only way of keeping up-to-date with what's going on at the Olympics. I agree with the Australian Olympic Committee President, John Coates, who said that the decision of this government would especially disappoint rural and regional Australians who might not have access to commercial or television coverage of next year's event. When the government cuts the ABC, Australians miss out, especially those in rural and regional Australia. The government knew that when they made those cuts—$84 million—but they went ahead with them anyway. This is the end of an era in Australian sporting coverage via radio, and that is a decision made by the Australian Prime Minister. That denial of access is on the Prime Minister's hands.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to drought, I was recently in Dubbo. It's located in the vast seat of Parkes, which takes up most of the north-west of New South Wales. I have the privilege of being the duty senator for that area. I visited Dubbo in September with my friend and colleague Jason Clare, the member for Blaxland, who is the shadow minister for regional services, territories and local government, and also the shadow minister for housing and homelessness. In his policy areas he has particular care for the people in regional and rural Australia who are affected by the decisions of this government. We spoke with the local community, farmers, businesses, council, chambers of commerce and charities about the impact of this prolonged drought and the recently implemented water restrictions in Dubbo. Dubbo is a strong and resilient town, but, sadly, it seems to be forgotten by those opposite, because there's no sense of an integrated plan for the town at a federal level, especially when it comes to the drought. The council are doing everything that they can to plan, and their pleas to the federal government are falling on deaf ears.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've had senators in here running off lists of money that they say are in the pipeline, but there are no pipes. There are no pipelines to feed the water out to Wellington. There's no investment, after seven years in government. They could see there was an opportunity and they denied it. They didn't prepare this country for the drought, because they had no plan, and people in regional and rural Australia are reaping the costs of that failure to invest properly—the failure to plan; the failure to deliver for the people of rural and regional Australia. The coalition have done nothing to prepare those regions of our country, and the communities that live in them, for the drought. They've done nothing since 2013.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are in the midst of the most extreme drought on record. We know that towns are running out of water, and there has been no meaningful action by this government. The drought rages on. Farmers and rural communities lack a voice in this government, and the consequences are showing. Frankly, it's disturbing how poorly this government has mismanaged water policy in this country. Yes, we need it to rain and rain and rain—if only to just end the fires that are now alight across New South Wales. We went from catastrophe yesterday to emergency today, and there's no end in sight. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For farmers, we need meaningful, futureproofing rain and infrastructure, which the government still are not investing in. I think we can agree that the rural sector is tired of the ad hoc, piecemeal approach to drought reform. Labor have been saying for years that we support any measure the government want to take to support drought-affected farmers and communities. In fact, Mr Albanese was in Dubbo when he made that announcement, in a bipartisan way. You put up any proposal about investment in the bush, in regional and rural Australia, and we will support it. That is what he said, within weeks of taking the role of Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the Labor Party. And what have we seen? The federal government are sitting on their hands.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear announcement after announcement, but the reality is not hitting the ground. There were two more drought thought bubbles last Wednesday and Thursday from this lacklustre government, which fails all the basic tests. These latest political manoeuvrings came after the Prime Minister's bungled Drought Communities Program announcement in September, when Mr Morrison was caught out trying to give funding to councils in Victoria and South Australia that aren't actually in drought—yet there are communities in great need who cannot get assistance in a timely way from this government that seems deaf to their pleas. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Small businesses across these communities are failing by the dozen. This is a government that says it supports small business, but small business cannot thrive in a climate where the government fails to do its job. Small businesses can't build great infrastructure. They rely on governments of vision to do that, and they need that building to be done before droughts hit. Rural and regional centres like Dubbo are resilient and have been incredibly prosperous. They are surviving in extremely difficult circumstances, but they deserve better than an incompetent government that has failed, for over half a decade, to plan for the infrastructure necessary to provide water security to this community and the communities that surround it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government has failed to make the disparity of health outcomes between rural- and metropolitan-dwelling Australians a priority in terms of health policy. Your postcode should not determine your level of health care. But unfortunately, under this inept government, this is the reality for a lot of people. We know that health outcomes for rural Australians are significantly below those in metropolitan Australia. Overall the burden of disease is 10 per cent higher in regional areas, 30 per cent higher in rural areas and a staggering 70 per cent higher in remote Australia. That is happening because the government has not properly looked after getting Australian-trained doctors into the right parts of this country. It has failed on so many fronts. I'd need another 40 minutes to document the gross level of failure of this government— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DAVEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">The Nationals Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:58</span>):  Thank you to Labor for raising this very important issue. I am very proud to have this opportunity to speak about exactly what the coalition government is doing for rural and regional Australia. Let's not forget that Labor had their chance as well. Labor did not build a dam either. Labor did not build any pipelines. Labor now stand here in hindsight and say: 'We're in drought. What are you doing about it? You should have expected this drought.' Well, hello? We are Australia. We have droughts and floods. And we are the first government to ever put in place a forward plan to help make our country more resilient for the next drought. Where were Labor when we first brought the Future Drought Fund to this place? They refused to support it. Despite what Senator O'Neill says about how Labor have reached out the hand of bipartisanship, they refused to support the first forward-thinking drought program this country has ever seen. It was brought in by the Liberals and the National Party in government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I could talk for hours about what the coalition government are doing for rural and regional Australia. Where to begin? We are decentralising. We are actually getting people and jobs out of the cities and into the regions. More than 200 have already been moved out of the cities. We are connecting the regions with the continued rollout of the NBN and the Mobile Black Spot Program. And, of course, we are addressing this current challenge of drought. What we are not doing is riding roughshod over the jurisdiction of the states, who have responsibility for town water supplies. We are working with the states, saying: 'What projects do you need? How do you need our help?' Together, we will work on getting through this drought.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal government is taking responsibility to help our farmers and communities here and now. We have the farm household allowance. Yesterday's amendments mean that 30,000 more farmers are eligible to access the farm household allowance. We have also introduced new loans programs. We're the first government to extend the drought support package to small businesses in drought-affected communities. Now these small businesses can access no-interest and low-interest loans through the Regional Investment Corporation. We are supporting local councils with the Drought Communities Program, getting $1 million into drought-affected councils, and we've extended that just recently. We're also bringing out another round of the Building Better Regions Fund that is specifically designed to help drought-affected communities build infrastructure and community support programs. And we've announced the water-for-fodder program, with 100 gigalitres of water being added to the southern basin thanks to working cooperatively with the South Australian government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our suite of drought relief measures goes to the heart of what actually matters. I live in a drought-impacted community, so I know what matters out there. From small businesses to primary producers, we are working with these communities to take the pressure off in one of the worst droughts in history. But we also know that we will be here again. That is why we brought in the Future Drought Fund. That is why we are delivering priority water infrastructure projects. Our $100 million National Water Grid Authority is now up and running. Specifically, in New South Wales, we are working with the state government to deliver major infrastructure upgrades, including a $650 million upgrade to Wyangala Dam in the state's central west to improve water reliability along the Lachlan River and a $480 million upgrade to Dungowan Dam near Tamworth to improve water security for the region, as well as undertaking a feasibility study into a Mole River dam to improve water reliability along the Border Rivers, which will help both New South Wales and Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are the first government in Australia's history to take a long-term, strategic approach to drought, and we are very proud of doing so. But, beyond the drought, we are also thinking about what is needed to help our country communities grow and prosper into the future. We are delivering the infrastructure needed, through several projects. We are also concerned about health. The coalition government are getting 3,000 additional doctors and 3,000 additional nurses and allied health professionals into rural practice. We are addressing rural mental health, supporting headspace services across the nation. We have the $503 million rural mental health strategy. We will continue to grow regional economies through delivering free trade agreements and opening up opportunities through projects like Inland Rail that will connect our regions to our ports to better facilitate agricultural exports. We will continue to deliver the infrastructure needed to improve economic and social outcomes for rural communities. I thank the Labor Party for giving me this opportunity to highlight just some of our projects. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="BK6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:04</span>):  Our nation's heart is very much with the people of the rural and remote parts of Australia. Australians have great respect for their true-blue country communities—including for our farmers, who are doing it very tough at present. This country has been built on the backs of our farmers—firstly, the sheep industry—and, even now, we rely very heavily on the food produced by the hard work of our agriculture and livestock farmers, and other rural industries. Farming is among the few industries that produce considerable value from effectively nothing. The crops and the livestock produced are value-added as they go along the supply chain, to the benefit of the economy. The marketeers add their mark-up, the retailers add their mark-up and the restaurants who prepare the produce for their diners also add a mark-up. At each step of the process the government takes a cut through taxation. The same could also be said of any business that invests in production and in the employment of local people in our country. Some suggest that in the 1930s, during the wool era, there was a six-to-one growth of money for the economy to the benefit of Canberra. Others suggest that figure today could be 11-to-one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The argument is that our primary producers are a foundational part of the money tree and, if they're gone, their earnings will be gone with them. So it is important that the government ensures rural and regional communities receive the services they need to survive and thrive, but the government is not always supportive of regional and remote communities. One example I've been raising lately is that the government has fallen flat on its support for the dairy industry. I have called for a mandatory code of conduct to protect the dairy industry and to help dairy farmers. The government has also fallen flat on its handling of water. Many landholders see water flow past them yet they are not allowed to access it, due to the act that says someone else owns the licences. Other farmers have seen water from dams like the Paradise Dam in Queensland flowing out to sea.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This matter of public importance here today is about the failure of the coalition government to deliver for rural and regional Australia. That may be the case—and I do support it—but what have the Labor Party been doing while they were in government, not just in the federal government but also the state? I see in the state of Queensland and as I travel around that towns are dying, shops are empty and services have been forsaken. Those communities are crying out about education, about hospitals being taken out of communities. They don't have birthing wards anymore in these communities, they can't get doctors there—they're only fly-in, fly-out—and they don't have aged-care facilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People live in these communities. Governments talk about bringing in refugees and migrants and think they can put them into these communities. That's not going to work; we can't keep our own people there. How on earth can we bring people from a totally different culture and way of life and put them in rural and regional Australia when Australians don't want to stay there? The government has tried to address this whole system at the moment with what is happening with our drought. It is what Australia is all about. Whether it's cyclones, droughts or floods, we will continue to go on in the future. It is about having a vision for Australia and having governments look at how we can best stop this from happening. With the droughts, you put in water infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Bernardi got up today and said, 'Why would you want to waste so much money on the Bradfield scheme?' Well, I'd say to Australians out there: at least it would provide much needed water to areas throughout Australia. Why on earth, then, would you want to spend $50 billion-plus building submarines in South Australia that are going to be defunct because they're diesel-electric submarines? By the time we get the last one in 2050, they will be defunct. So why are we spending billions of dollars on submarines when we can put in a Bradfield scheme that will deliver water throughout the eastern states, to his state of South Australia, for the cost of $15 billion? I know which one the Australian people would prefer to put their money into.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased this debate is here today, because Labor, a lot of times, forget about the bush. They really don't understand. They don't connect with people in the bush and that's why the people don't vote for them. And if the National Party keeps heading down this pathway, people won't be voting for them either, because they are no longer the people of the bush representing the bush. So I'm pleased that we're here and discussing this, because those communities need all the help they can get.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:09</span>):  I also rise to speak on this matter of public importance. I do so because this coalition government is failing to deliver for rural and regional Australian families, that failure is hitting hard in my home state of South Australia—a state which, mind you, does care about our subs jobs, which needs our subs jobs—and it would be nice if senators on the other side could actually show our state some support. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has failed South Australians on jobs, failed them on health, failed them on education and failed them on the ABC. And it has failed the most vulnerable regional and rural South Australians the most. Across our country, more than one in eight people are living below the poverty line, but the worst statistics are confined to South Australia, which has the highest rate of poverty in comparison to all other jurisdictions in Australia. Within my state, rural and regional South Australians remain the hardest hit by poverty. If you live outside our capital city of Adelaide, you are twice as likely to be living below the poverty line. But it does not have to be this way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Underlying these statistics are a series of policy decisions and failures by this coalition government that have made the financial pressure being experienced by families in rural and regional South Australia worse—policy decisions like cutting pensions and cutting family payments; refusing to lift the rate of Newstart; attacking Medicare and the universality of our healthcare system; and taking away penalty rates, payments that ensure working Australians can have a quality standard of living and a liveable wage. These policy choices have made it harder and harder for struggling Australians to make ends meet, and these policy decisions have failed rural and regional South Australians more than any other.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our towns in South Australia are doing it tough. They're doing it really tough. This is plainly evident in the far-too-high rates of unemployment and underemployment in my state. Labour force figures recently released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics show us that South Australia has the highest unemployment rate in the country, at 7.3 per cent. While costs are going up, wages aren't, and South Australians are earning less than people in most other states and well below the national average. In regional areas, it is even worse. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, in their employment trends snapshot report, which was released in September this year, found that in 2018 the unemployment rate for outer regional areas was 6.8 per cent nationally, compared to 5.2 per cent in major cities. For young Australians in rural and regional Australia aged 15 to 24, the statistics are even worse. The unemployment rate in 2018 for young people was 12.7 per cent in inner regional areas and a staggering 15.8 per cent in outer regional areas. If this is not failing young Australians in rural and regional Australia, I don't know what is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unemployment is having an impact on entire communities. Businesses are closing as more and more people find themselves out of work and without any form of discretionary income. If you walk through the centre of Murray Bridge, you will find too many empty shops, left vacant by businesses that just could not stay afloat in the current economic environment. And you will find business owners and employees who are scared. They're terrified of what their future holds in a town that they, rightly, love so much.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rural and regional South Australians and their families deserve better, yet the Liberals who claim to speak for rural and regional South Australians and who actually have control over the policy levers that can help them are sitting on their hands. Let me give you a tip: the most effective policy option in front of you is to raise the rate of Newstart. Ask the BCA. Ask John Howard. Ask KPMG. Increasing Newstart would not only help people doing it tough but deliver immediate and significant economic stimulus, especially in our rural and regional areas. In rural and regional South Australia, there are 19,633 people on Newstart. Just imagine the stimulus impact in these parts of our state if these Newstart recipients had more money in their pockets, more money that would go directly into their local economy. It would mean less financial and economic pressure on South Australian families and a greater spend in shops and businesses across our regions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On my recent visits to places like Ceduna and Murray Bridge, I spoke to countless residents and business owners who are crying out for economic stimulus in their towns. They are crying out for investment and they are crying out for more jobs. An increase to Newstart could help deliver this, but this government has no plan for rural and regional South Australia and its local economies. The government clearly has no plan to deal with low wages and rising prices. Boosting Newstart would provide much-needed economic stimulus in our regions. It's not just a social policy issue; it's about growing our economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government keep talking about their plans to boost the economy and the importance of regional Australia, yet there is a policy at their fingertips that offers an immediate and localised economic stimulus and they're refusing to consider it in favour of peddling further stigmatisation and demeaning our welfare recipients. Australians are worried about the economy, but the Liberals are pretending there is no problem. They're ignoring rural and regional Australians, who are pleading for the government to come up with a genuine plan to get our economy moving again. But the Liberals just have an agenda for cuts. Since 2014, this government's funding cuts to TAFE, education and health have hit regional communities the hardest. In each budget, the Prime Minister and his government have said they will spend more on regional infrastructure, but he always spends less than promised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As they say, when all else fails, form a committee. Scott Morrison has now formed two parliamentary committees on the needs of rural and regional Australia. But where is the plan? Where is the economic stimulus that rural and regional Australia so desperately needs? And, beyond these economic questions, where is the government when it comes to the regional health divide?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 17 October, Ceduna Hospital was forced to suspend its birthing services until December, due to a temporary shortage of staff. The shortage of staff is across a number of areas, including GPs, obstetricians, midwives and anaesthetists. What are the women of Ceduna meant to do now? And where is the government?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my first speech in this place, I spoke about my Aunty Lynette, from Port Lincoln, and her horror maternal-health story of 40 years ago, when, because of an inability to cater for a high-needs newborn in a local hospital, Lynette was separated from her child for 17 weeks. The baby was in Adelaide in hospital and Lynette was in Port Lincoln, for 17 long, painful, excruciating weeks.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, 40 years later, families in Ceduna will be forced to travel hundreds of kilometres to access basic maternal-health services. How can it be the case that so little has changed for rural and regional South Australian women? It is absolutely not good enough. It's not good enough for women and their families in regional South Australia, and it shouldn't be good enough for this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's failures for regional and rural South Australians just go on and on. Let's look at their record on education. Public schools in Australia teach two in three of all students and the overwhelming majority of Australia's neediest children. Within public schools, we find 82 per cent of the poorest children, 84 per cent of Indigenous children and 74 per cent of children with disability. But, because of this coalition government's cuts, almost nine in 10 public schools will never get to their fair funding level. In South Australia, the re-election of this government meant that schools in our three largest rural and regional electorates of Barker, Mayo and Grey missed out on a total of $97 million of much-needed funding. Murray Bridge High School alone missed out on $1.89 million, Port Lincoln High School missed out on $1.5 million and Port Pirie West Primary School missed out on $440,000. Just imagine the difference this would have made to these schools.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As if the divide that exists on health, education, jobs and wages for rural and regional Australians wasn't enough, the government cuts the ABC. Rural and regional South Australians rely on the ABC like no others. It is essential for local content, stories and emergency information. This year, the Liberals announced yet another cut of $83 million, by freezing indexation of the ABC's operational funding from 2019-20. As if that also wasn't enough, the Liberals have launched the biggest attack on the independence of the ABC in a generation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After years of cuts at the hands of this coalition government, and with a further three years of cuts ahead of it, the ABC has now sadly decided to end its 67-year run as the official non-commercial Olympic Games radio broadcaster. Now Australians will miss out on much-loved content that is part of Australia's media, sporting and cultural identity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">South Australia is lucky to have four excellent local ABC Radio services around South Australia to complement the metro service. The local ABC presence in these towns is becoming more and more essential as regional newspapers struggle in the changing media landscape. For the sake of those for whom ABC Radio is their main connection to Australia and the world, the government must ensure stable and adequate funding for our national broadcaster. If the coalition government is indeed genuine in its intention to serve regional Australia, then the solution is straightforward: fund the ABC properly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On these issues, and on so many others, it is painfully clear that the Liberal government is out of touch with regional and rural South Australians. The people of my state deserve so much better, whether they live in the bush or in a town centre. They all deserve a fair go—a job, a good education, quality healthcare services and a properly funded ABC. Instead, they've got a government that refuses to deliver any of these things. They've got a government that has completely failed rural and regional South Australians.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HENDERSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:19</span>):  It's my great pleasure to rise and speak on this MPI, at a time when our nation is facing so many bushfire emergencies. I want to make the point that I regret that we are at odds with each other across the chamber, on a contentious proposal by Labor senators, when our nation is in the grips of a national emergency. After the terrible loss of a number of lives and several hundred homes and buildings, all in regional and rural communities—and we know only too well that rural and regional Australians cop the brunt of so many national disasters—it is regrettable that today's MPI is not about the people in those communities at this time of national emergency. I salute the thousands of people working so hard on the frontline in rural and regional New South Wales and Queensland to fight these fires and to protect communities—our volunteer firefighters, and our other emergency services personnel.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to correct some of the comments that Senator M Smith made in her contribution. I believe that one of the reasons Labor did not succeed at the last federal election is the Australian people saw through Labor's mistruths. I want to correct Senator M Smith and make it quite clear to the Australian people that this government has not cut pensions, has not cut family payments and is delivering record amounts of education and health funding. When you carry on making ridiculous claims which are not substantiated by any fact, the Australian people lose faith in politicians. I think that's one of the very major reasons why Australians lost faith in Labor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, in Labor's own review, released a number of days ago, one of the key issues identified on why Labor did not succeed at the federal election was that it turned its back on so many rural and regional communities. I saw that well and good in my former role as the member for Corangamite. I spent a lot of time mopping up the damage from Labor's failed policies and its failure to invest sufficiently in roads, rail and essential communications infrastructure. When Labor was last in power, it did not provide one single dollar for mobile communications. Its carbon tax had such a major impact on our farmers—on our dairy farmers in particular—as well as our manufacturers. Where I am located in regional Victoria—I am proudly based in Geelong and I am looking after Bendigo, Ballarat, Geelong and the Mallee, as well as parts of Melbourne's west—we see notorious offenders in the likes of Catherine King, Richard Marles, Libby Coker and Lisa Chesters, and many Labor members in Melbourne's west who have not stood up—</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="123072" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McDONALD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:25</span>):  I actually don't need to say much, because this same statement was put to the Australian people in May, and rural and regional Australians answered resoundingly that they have more faith in the coalition to advance their interests. But I'd like to set the record straight. Never before have we had a government so focused on regional and rural Australia. This was evident back in February, when the Prime Minister travelled to Cloncurry and Julia Creek as soon as possible after the devastating floods, and funds were immediately released for farmers and businesses. Now the same support is being provided for these new challenges facing rural and regional Australia, of drought and now fires.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those who live in the regions are amongst the most innovative and certainly the best land managers in the world, particularly our graziers and farmers. However, we also know that agriculture is dependent on our seasonal conditions and terms of trade. As a government, we are focused on doing everything we can do to support our farming and grazing communities by building resilience and providing opportunity in our agricultural sectors. Approximately 70 per cent of our agricultural production is exported. The increase in research and productivity is something to be celebrated. I look forward to the introduction of the dairy code of conduct, which, like the sugar code of conduct, will provide our agricultural industries with certainty. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are benefiting from agreements with Japan, China, South Korea, Peru, Indonesia, Hong Kong and Pacific Island nations. We're working to deliver a new agreement with the EU and, together with the UK, are committed to negotiating an Australia-UK FTA as soon as the UK is in a position to do so. Manbulloo, Australia's largest single exporter of mangoes, with farms in Townsville and Katherine, have seen huge growth since the Korea and China FTAs. Scott Koetsier has said that, since the launch of the KAFTA, they've gone from exporting 10 tonnes to over 100 tonnes of mangoes to Korea. This is just one example of the great things the coalition is doing supporting small businesses in rural and regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the coalition government's 2015 agriculture white paper, we have a long-term $4 billion plan that helps farmers with farm business concessional loans, stronger biosecurity, control of pest animals and weeds and new investment in R&amp;D. To support Australian farmers with labour shortages, we're making the working holiday-maker visas and the Seasonal Worker Program more flexible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's the big one: the Liberals and Nationals government has committed over $6.3 billion for drought relief and recovery. This is on top of the Future Drought Fund to improve drought resilience in regional areas. We have the Northern Australia Beef Roads and Roads of Strategic Importance programs, which have set aside nearly $5 billion to ensure regional and rural Australia have reliable and safe roads. Our Mobile Black Spot Program is delivering 1,047 new mobile phone towers and coverage to almost 40,000 more homes and businesses. Our $550 million Stronger Rural Health Strategy is delivering 3,000 additional doctors and more than 3,000 additional nurses and allied health professionals in rural general practice over the next decade. Rural generalist training funding was committed to during the election. We've established grants for agricultural shows to invest in new infrastructure so they can keep bringing joy to their communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we get to that four-letter word that makes the Labor Party desperately search for the nearest exit: dams. We've got $2 billion in loans available for those who want to build water infrastructure. Recently we announced $1 billion to upgrade Wyangala Dam and build the new Dungowan Dam in New South Wales. In Queensland we've got the Hells Gate Dam, the Big Rocks Weir, the Hughenden Irrigation Project, the Emu Swamp Dam, Uralla, Nullinga, Nagoya, MITEZ and Forsyth. In total the federal government has now committed about $1.5 billion for 21 water projects across Australia. This desire to help regional and rural Australia is also apparent at the state level in Queensland, where the LNP has unveiled a progressive plan to irrigate the dry interior after decades of shameful inaction by Labor for regional residents and farmers. The coalition's new $525 million Skills Package will deliver up to 80,000 new apprentices over five years in priority areas of skills shortage, unlike Labor in Queensland, who have closed down the Emerald and Longreach agricultural colleges.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More broadly we're looking at our vocational education system. It needs an upgrade to ensure that it remains world-class, modern and flexible. Small businesses are the engine room of our economy. The coalition is helping small businesses invest and grow through increasing and expanding the instant asset write-off, which now covers assets up to $30,000 for a business with a turnover of up to $50 million. We are a vast country and are dependent on air travel. Regional connectivity is important, and the coalition has announced a further $28 million over four years to fund works designed to improve the safety and capacity of remote airstrips. I would like to thank Senator Gallagher for giving me the opportunity to explain how much the coalition is doing. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="283601" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator VAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:32</span>):  I, too, thank Senator Gallagher for this opportunity to speak on this timely matter of public importance relating to the coalition's government's support for regional and rural Australia. One thing is extremely clear: the coalition government backs regional Australia. We don't just want our regions to succeed; we want them to thrive. Just like my beloved Collingwood Magpies, we as coalition senators stand side by side with our farmers and small businesses in regional Australia. In my home state of Victoria we have around 21,200 farm businesses employing 77,000 people. Luckily, Victoria, this time around, is not as affected by drought as some states are. The devastation we're seeing in regional and rural New South Wales and Queensland is indeed tragic, and our thoughts are with those affected farmers and communities. Therefore, I note with pride that last week we, the coalition government, announced an additional $709 million towards our drought relief package. This will support farmers affected by drought and will see money flow right through the economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government's strategy is focused on three themes. Firstly, there is immediate action for those in drought. To date, we've helped over 12,700 farming families, with up to $100,000 for each family, paid over four years. It is important to note that this is not a loan, as it does not have to be paid back. However, additionally we are making new and existing drought loans for farmers interest-free for two years. These loans of up to $2 million will mean farmers can continue to purchase fodder, pay for freight and pay their farmhands. This will save farmers who refinance thousands of dollars and will help them get back on their feet when the drought breaks. The second prong of our strategy focuses on support for the wider communities affected by drought. The coalition government have committed an additional $1 million for each of the 122 drought affected councils and shires if they need it. Nationally, another $378 million will go into drought-affected community projects and an extra $138.9 million will go into our Roads to Recovery initiative. The third prong of our strategy addresses long-term resilience and preparedness. One initiative is the 100 gigalitres of water from South Australia that will be used to produce up to 120,000 tonnes of fodder such as silage and pasture. This will be a very big help to farmers in securing supplies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So many communities across regional Australia have been doing it tough through this drought, and this package will help everyone get through it. It helps to protect jobs and the economy so that, when the drought breaks, we will bounce back even faster. This is one of the most important issues for all levels of government right now. We will continue to respond in practical and pragmatic ways for as long as it takes. Let me be clear: the coalition government is certainly not failing regional and rural Australia. We proudly stand by our strong policies and meaningful actions.</span>

The custom is that information about non-conforming petitions is shared at the cross-whips meetings and advice is then sought.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was honoured last month to be elected Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights. As senators no doubt know, the mandate of this important committee is to examine all bills and legislative instruments that come before either house of the parliament for compatibility with Australia's human rights obligations under the seven international human rights treaties ratified by Australia, and to report to both houses of the parliament on that issue. The committee's work is focused on prevention and education with regard to human rights compatibility. As such, the committee seeks to determine the risk that legislation may be applied in ways that could breach human rights and to suggest avenues and safeguards for addressing areas of concern.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of this mandate, on 29 July 2019 the committee resolved to conduct an inquiry into the Quality of Care Amendment (Minimising the Use of Restraints) Principles 2019. This legislative instrument seeks to minimise the use of physical and chemical restraints in residential aged-care facilities. The use of physical and chemical restraints without consent raises significant human rights concerns, including in relation to the absolute prohibition on cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; the rights to health, privacy and liberty; the right to equality and nondiscrimination; and the rights of persons with disabilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has examined this instrument in detail, including holding a public hearing and receiving a number of submissions from experts, advocates, the aged-care sector and the Department of Health. The committee strongly supports the instrument's intention to seek to minimise the use of physical and chemical restraint by approved providers in the aged-care setting, noting that, under international human rights law, Australia is under an obligation to take steps to reduce and eliminate such practices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After reviewing all the evidence, the majority committee report has concluded that, while, on the face of it, the instrument appears to engage and limit a number of human rights, existing state and territory laws continue to apply to regulate the use of restraints. As these other laws continue to apply, the committee report has concluded that this instrument, by further regulating approved providers, does not directly limit human rights. Nonetheless, the instrument appears to have created widespread confusion around the legal obligations of approved providers. In particular, there appears to be confusion around the issue of consent, which is particularly concerning, given the evidence recently noted in the interim report of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety regarding the overprescription of psychotropic medication and poor practice regarding consent. Considering the evidence presented to our inquiry, the committee is concerned that this confusion may have also led to confusion about the permissibility of the administration of both physical and chemical restraints being used in residential aged-care facilities without informed consent and without first exhausting all alternatives. As such, in practice, this may limit a number of human rights.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The majority of the committee has therefore recommended that the instrument and explanatory materials be amended to clarify that other laws continue to prohibit the use of restraint without informed consent, and that the minister should undertake extensive consultation with relevant stakeholders to work towards further strengthening the regulation of restraints. The majority report has taken this approach rather than seeking to recommend that the instrument be disallowed, as to disallow the instrument would result in an absence of federal regulation of the use of physical and chemical restraints. An absence of any express federal regulation would be a major backward step and also not send an appropriate message to the aged-care sector. For this reason, the majority of the committee strongly take issue with any attempt to disallow this instrument, which we believe would be irresponsible and may lead to unintended consequences. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this regard I welcome the Minister for Health's quick response to the interim report of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, and particularly his recognition of the need to take further steps in relation to the regulation of the use of chemical restraints.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I encourage my fellow senators, the government and others to examine the committee's report, and with these comments I commend the committee's report on the Quality of Care Amendment (Minimising the Use of Restraints) Principles 2019 to the Senate.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKIM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:50</span>):  I wish to make some comments on the report that's just been tabled by the chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, and I thank Senator Henderson for tabling that report and for the remarks that she's just given.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As one of the members of that committee who dissented from the majority report of the committee, I want to place on the record the reasons for that. But, before I do that, I do wish to inform the Senate that it's my understanding that this is the first ever dissenting report issued by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, and that decision was not taken lightly by the members of the committee who have endorsed the dissenting report, those members, along with me, being Mr Perrett MP, who is the deputy chair of the committee; Senator Green; Senator Dodson; and Mr Georganas MP, from the other place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We didn't take this decision lightly. But we believe, on the balance of the evidence that was provided to the committee during our hearings and during our inquiry into this instrument, that it was important that we did agree to submit and endorse a dissenting report. Before I go to the detail of some of that evidence, it's worth saying that this does come in the context of an interim report from the royal commission that said the following about the instrument that we are recommending be disallowed:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Principles add to, rather than overcome, concerns regarding regulation of physical and chemical restraint, including on issues of consent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was broadly reflected in much of the evidence that the committee entertained during our hearing. For example, we had evidence from Mr Geoff Rowe who's the chief executive officer of Aged and Disability Advocacy Australia, who said that the instrument legitimises behaviour that occurs currently.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth pointing out that the interim report of the royal commission laid bare a horrendous tale of abuse and neglect perpetrated on older Australians in particular. Certainly, speaking on behalf of the Australian Greens, we believe the government needs to do much more than it currently is to respond to those revelations, and much more than is currently contained in the regulation that this dissenting report recommends be disallowed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission in its interim report also identified a significant overreliance on chemical restraint in aged care as one of the three areas requiring urgent action. It is my view as the Australian Greens representative on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights that the way this instrument seeks to regulate chemical restraint is far worse than the way this instrument seeks to regulate physical constraint.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do also want to address comments made by the chair that disallowing this instrument might result in there being no regulation at all. I will just make it very clear that in fact disallowing this instrument would not necessarily have to result in no regulation of the use of chemical restraints or physical restraints. That is because, even though our dissenting report does recommend disallowing and even though Senator Siewert has withdrawn the disallowance that I co-sponsored with her, there are still two disallowance motions sitting on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>—one that I've tabled on behalf of the Joint Committee on Human Rights and one other. Those are to be postponed until the next week that we are sitting, which, of course, is not next week but the following week, so the minister has got a couple of weeks now to come up with a decent set of regulations. If there is a disallowance moved and this Senate does decide to disallow the existing instrument, the minister has two weeks notice. If I were the minister, I would be head down and backside up, working as hard as I could to come up with an instrument that actually does the job and properly regulates the use of restraints, both chemical and physical, to the satisfaction of the Senate. The instrument that this inquiry assessed and the one that the dissenting members of the committee are recommending be disallowed is just not fit for purpose. It simply does not do the job that it should do and, particularly, that is able to be argued in the context of the interim report of the royal commission. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The recommendations in our dissenting report are: firstly, that the Quality of Care Amendment (Minimising the Use of Restraints) Principles 2019 should be disallowed; importantly, secondly, that in the short term we urgently re-introduce a new instrument to ensure the provision of informed consent for the use of chemical restraints, reducing the use of restraints, oversight and effective reporting of the use of restraints; and, thirdly, that a widespread consultation process be implemented urgently to determine the best regulatory framework to protect residents of aged-care facilities in the use of restraints.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we don't need to vacate this space, and it is actually important that we don't vacate the space. But the ball now is firmly in the minister's court, because Labor members and the Australian Greens member on the Joint Committee on Human Rights have made it abundantly clear through the mechanism of this dissenting report that in fact we do not believe that the current instrument does the job of properly regulating the use of restraints in aged-care facilities and in supported-care facilities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to colleagues that there is now a little bit of time for the minister to do the work that actually should have been done before this instrument was created, came into force and was tabled in this Senate. Two weeks is long enough to do the job. We've got all the evidence so painstakingly gathered by the Joint Committee on Human Rights. I do want to thank members of that committee and the secretariat of that committee for their really outstanding work on this issue. But, ultimately, we did not take this step lightly. This is, on my understanding, the first dissenting report to be tabled in the Joint Committee on Human Rights. Quite simply, dissenting members believe that, as some of the most vulnerable people in Australia, older Australians who are living in aged care do deserve the same human rights protections as everybody else in this country. And we do not believe that the current instrument, the principles, provides for the requisite level of certainty around protecting the human rights of people who are in supported accommodation in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In concluding, I just want to again urge the minister to take the opportunity that he now has, with a week and a half or two weeks of time to do the job that actually should have been done by the previous minister who tabled this instrument and craft an instrument that actually does satisfactorily protect not just the human rights but the lives of the people affected by this instrument.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Safety and quality in hospitals is primarily the responsibility of states and territories. The Australian Government supports the states and territories in improving hospital quality and safety by jointly funding the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care (the Commission).</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">By working in partnership with the Australian Government, states and territories, the private sector, clinical experts, and patients and carers, the Commission aims to ensure that the health system is better informed, supported and organised to deliver safe and high-quality care.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">All hospitals and day procedures are required to implement the Commission's National Safety and Quality Health Service (NSQHS) Standards. The NSQHS Standards were developed by the Commission in collaboration with the Australian Government, states and territories, private sector providers, clinical experts, patients and carers. The primary aims of the NSQHS Standards are to protect the public from harm and to improve the quality of health service provision.</span>

              <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">Partnering with Consumers - describes the systems and strategies to create a person­centred health system by including patients in shared decision making, to ensure that patients are partners in their own care, and that consumers are involved in the development and design of quality health care.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to the NSQHS, the Commission has issued Clinical Care Standards. A Clinical Care Standard is a small number of quality statements that describe the care patients should be offered by health professionals and health services for a specific clinical condition or defined clinical pathway in line with current best evidence. Clinical Care Standards can play an important role in delivering appropriate care and reducing unwarranted variation, as they identify and define the care people should expect to be offered or receive, regardless of where they are treated in Australia.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="140651" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'NEILL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:03</span>):  This is a very, very important debate to have around the NDIS and its rollout because, frankly, this government has failed in its task to implement the NDIS. When I was making my comments earlier in the day—I am continuing those this evening as we return to the bill—I was making the point that the government has made a great song and dance about $4.6 billion which was underspent on the delivery of services to people with disabilities. The government have collared that money, put it across the books into their column and used it as a substantial part of what they claim is their surplus on the back of people with disability. That tells you everything that you need to know about the shameless behaviour of this government, the pride that they have in doing it and the gross failure and mismanagement that has characterised their rollout of the NDIS. On average, to achieve that goal, they had to short-change participants in the scheme by $20,000 a year—take $20,000 out of their plans in an underspend. And, boy, did they organise that underspend well, providing only a third of the recommended staffing level to properly roll out the NDIS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet Minister Stuart Robert and the NDIA chair, Helen Nugent, have specifically requested a bonus of an additional $166,260 per year for the NDIA's CEO, on top of his already sizeable salary of $554,220. Despite being paid for the job, he wants extras for doing such a good job of cutting the services and funds to people with disability. That is what this National-Liberal party coalition government is doing to people with disability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS is due to be fully rolled out in 2020, but it's seriously off-track in many areas. National Disability Services, the peak body for the disability service industry, alleged last year that the NDIS owes $300 million to providers. Yet we have Senator Cash in here at question time saying what a good job they're doing in terms of getting money out to businesses. There are businesses providing services in remote and regional communities that are going under because this government isn't paying its bills. People are falling through the cracks of the NDIS. They're being forced to wait months or even years as their claims and disputes are fought out in layers of bureaucracies and tribunals. Indeed, some people have died from complications exacerbated by the failure to provide them with essential needs, including things you would think could be provided, such as a wheelchair that was the right size. People have died waiting. But the government saved $4.6 billion, and they have a surplus, they say. Well, that surplus is no comfort to people who are burying those they loved while this government sits on its hands and doesn't roll this program out properly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2018 Commonwealth Ombudsman review found that a third of all of the complaints that went to the Ombudsman were about delays in the NDIS and its rollout. The review also found that the NDIA had trouble identifying and prioritising the urgent cases, such as when a participant may be at risk of harm or homelessness, and that it simply didn't have a process to correct simple or clear errors and, certainly, didn't do it quickly or carefully. The arbitrary staffing cap decided by this Liberal-National party government was set at 4,000—that's it. It falls far below what's necessary to manage this program with many participants, and it forces the agency to spend millions of dollars on consultants rather than actually build the capacity of the public sector. The government constructed a model of longer waiting times and less access to services for participants, and that has led to a massive backlog of claims. But it's not just the backlog that is the problem; it's what it means for families across this nation that have been mistreated, ignored and disparaged by this government and its failure in the rollout of the NDIS. This bill should be opposed.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="263418" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DUNIAM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Forestry and Fisheries and Assistant Minister for Regional Tourism</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:28</span>):  Tonight I'm talking about the Victorian forestry industry and what's happened in recent times in the state of Victoria in the magnificent, sustainable, world-class forestry industry. What the Andrews Labor government has done in Victoria in recent days is devastating. Our regional communities are so dependent on a number of industries, forestry being one of them, and Daniel Andrews and his cabinet have decided that native forest harvesting—something that we do better than most other countries in the world—is an industry that they, as a state, do not want to be a part of anymore. It's a very bad decision for regional communities. Nearly 5,000 jobs directly out of the native-forest harvesting sector are in Victoria. There will be $300 million of economic activity ripped out of regional communities in Victoria every year because of a decision by a government to abandon a particular part of our forestry industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For those listening, there are two parts to our forestry industry in terms of the trees we harvest. We have plantation, which forms the great majority of timber harvested in this country, and we also have native forests. They are different types of timber, producing different types of goods. It's important to emphasise that out of native forest harvesting, we still have demand for our product—for the appearance-grade timber that we get out of native forest harvesting. And communities like this now have to start thinking about their future. The sawmills geared up to harvest, mill and produce products out of native forest timber now need to think about what they're going to do, given the Labor government has sold them out. It's a decision that's more about politics than it is about policy. It ignores completely the growing demand globally and domestically for our wonderful, sustainable, environmentally friendly native forest products, which come out of our well-managed, beautiful native forests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regional communities, as I say, are dependent on this industry, amongst others. And it's something that I and this government—the Morrison government—will stand up for. We condemn the decision by the Andrews government to shut down native forest harvesting in Victoria. It's something that we hope they see sense in and look to reverse rather than pushing ahead pig-headedly, not listening to what the community has to say. As a Tasmanian, I know only too well what happens when the Greens get near the levers of power, and I think that is the case in Victoria. The Andrews government, worried about what's going to happen in its inner-city seats, is pandering to Green minorities in downtown Melbourne, rather than going out and listening to the people whose livelihoods depend on this industry. They're selling them out to make sure that when the next election rolls around, they will get those preferences from those Green voters in those inner-city seats. What a terrible methodology to employ when it comes to governing a state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How many livelihoods and how many futures are at stake in these communities that we see doing it tough all the time, through natural disasters like we're experiencing now, or through the ups and downs of the commodity price cycle? We need to stand by these communities, not abandon them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A huge number of jobs were lost in Tasmania when the Greens got into bed with Labor and started governing our state. They virtually shut down our forestry industry overnight. A majority of the jobs—most of them in native forest harvesting—were gone. It was bad for our economy. We started going backwards because Labor in Tasmania were appeasing the Greens in Tasmania. While they might have won a couple of votes out of it in our major population centres, it was bad policy and it's been bad for jobs. It is something that results in a terrible outcome for regional communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I suppose the one message I have for the Andrews government and for other Labor governments around the country is: don't be tempted to do a deal with the Greens to shut down a particular part of any primary industry or extractive industry. They might tell you that they're happy to stop at native forest harvesting: 'If you end native forest harvesting, we'll get off your case forever.' I can guarantee to you now that the Greens won't stop there. We know for a fact that they will not stop until the last chainsaw falls silent. It's native forest harvesting and the native forest industries—the haulage contractors, the tree fellers, the millers—that are the target today, but tomorrow it will be plantations. It will happen. You only have to go to the comments by former Greens senator Bob Brown that confirm this point. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="168275" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SHELDON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:33</span>):  I rise today to highlight what I believe to be one of the most disturbing and dystopian experiments being conducted in the world today. I speak of the plans by the Chinese government to construct a vast ecosystem of social, economic and political surveillance and control over its citizens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This social credit system, as it is widely known, is a work in progress and is best understood as a set of pilot systems being built and operated by the central government and local authorities in coordination with corporate digital platforms. These pilot systems are not dissimilar to the credit scores which are widely used by banks and other businesses in many countries to determine whether a person can borrow money and, if so, how much. But the longer-term aim of these systems goes much further than determining the criminal history or financial creditworthiness of a person. The aim is to bring together a vast swathe of fragmented digital datasets to monitor the actions, economic activity and political behaviour of citizens and companies, and to use that information to reward and punish them based on how trustworthy or how compliant the authorities deem them to be. Already in China people are being denied the right to travel or are finding obstacles to getting credit or applying for jobs based on their perceived trustworthiness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Human rights observers believe that these systems are in their infancy. They say that the accuracy, intrusiveness and enforcement varies greatly across China's provinces, but the early evidence we have of the intent of the authorities and the potential for abuse of social credit systems is deeply concerning. The ability of ordinary people to challenge the authorities, get access to their records or have them amended is severely limited. Even questioning the authorities about your record can invite retaliation. What is unfolding in China should alarm everyone who cares about human rights, labour rights and consumer rights not just in China but around the world. We are already seeing the terrifying experiment that is being conducted now in far Western China, where the Uygur people are being subjected to perhaps the most advanced example of a surveillance state the world has seen. They are feeling the full force of police harassment, arbitrary incarceration, forced labour and family separation and of the denial of free speech, freedom of religion, freedom of association and freedom of assembly. But they are also being subjected to the fast-developing data enabled surveillance state of CCTV cameras, messaging interception, facial recognition based monitoring and forced installation of spyware on their phones.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to face the fact that the social credit surveillance system will be extended to overseas Chinese populations. This includes the citizens of Hong Kong, Chinese Australian citizens and students resident in Australia and Australian companies that operate in China. Chinese Australians are likely to feel the impact of this system when they want to travel in China to visit relatives and when they make transactions or communicate on WeChat or use payments systems like Alipay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Senate estimates hearings last month I asked how the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is preparing for the emergence of the social credit system. The department is aware that the social credit system can or will ultimately impact Chinese Australian citizens, students studying in Australia and Australian businesses that have connections to China. But I did express my surprise that there didn't seem to be a very well developed view on how Australia needs to prepare for the surveillance tentacles that are coming, if they are not here already.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is incumbent on democracies, including Australia, to fight for human rights, labour rights and consumer rights abroad. We must also lead by example and ensure that we are protecting the privacy and freedoms of our own citizens. When we rightly cast a critical eye over the rising surveillance culture in China we must also be on guard that those same human freedoms are not being undermined by stealth here at home either by our own intelligence and law enforcement agencies or by those of another country.</span>

On Monday 11 November 2019, the final chain from the top of the Uluru climb was removed. Uluru slept, for the first time in decades, beneath a moonlit sky, with no posts or chains on its surface. I was privileged to attend the closing of the Uluru climb on 27 October, along with my federal Labor colleagues Linda Burney, Warren Snowdon and Senator Patrick Dodson. The closing ceremony, organised by the Uluru Kata Tjuta National Park and the Anangu TOs, was an incredibly special event. I would like to thank the Anangu traditional owners for their personal invitation. As the sun set, performances by the Central Australian Aboriginal Women's Choir, Mutitjulu School and Shellie Morris welcomed the 2,000 or so guests. The Inma, or traditional dance, performed by seven surrounding communities, was so incredibly moving in the red sand against the backdrop of Uluru. Later, Mala Band, Mutitjulu Band, Shane Howard Trio with Trevor Adamson and Docker River Band performed, with surprise guest Peter Garrett performing 'Beds Are Burning'.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">For me personally, it was a time to reflect on the hand-back of the rock in 1985. I was a teenage girl in Alice Springs at that time, and I remember the hope it gave for our future. I remember thinking, 'Australia's looking good. It's starting to recognise the First Nations people and acknowledge our importance in this country.' There were, naturally, criticisms at the time—terrible criticisms, like the sky was going to cave in if the rock was handed back to the Anangu. But none of that happened. Indeed, the Anangu immediately leased Uluru back to the Commonwealth as a national park, for the whole of Australia—and, indeed, the world—to enjoy, and they generously allowed people to continue to climb, while asking that people respect their wishes and choose not to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last few months, we saw a few diverging opinions on the closure of the climb, but, all in all, I think Australia is in a much better place in terms of wanting to understand, appreciate and recognise First Nations people and culture. It indicates, I hope, a maturity in our nation—a coming together and acknowledging the importance of First Nations people to our national story, not just in the history books but in our current national Australian story, a living story. It indicates respect for Aboriginal culture, and it will become one of the defining stories of our nation's healing and reconciliation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, as I've said before in this place, the decision to close the climb was a long time coming. In 2010, the Anangu announced their intention to close the climb once fewer than 20 per cent of visitors chose to scale Uluru. In 2017, that number reached 16 per cent, and the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park Board of Management announced that they would close the climb on 26 October 2019, with the ceremony on 27 October 2019.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Uluru is an incredibly sacred place. It is part of the Tjukurpa, an Anangu word for songline—the Tjukurpa that stretches far across Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I feel immensely proud of the Anangu for their strength at this time and deeply heartened by the respect shown by the Australian people in respecting their decision. I hope many in this chamber and across Australia will continue to visit this incredibly beautiful, spiritual and peaceful place that is there for all Australians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:42</span>):  Before I start, I want to thank all those who are in Queensland and New South Wales and other parts of Australia, but particularly Queensland, helping to protect us from the fires. In particular, I've been in touch with my lower house colleagues, and Keith Pitt and Michelle Landry are out talking to people on the ground.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's one of the regions impacted by the fires today that I want to focus on, and that's Bundaberg and the Wide Bay Burnett region, a part of Queensland that is known for its produce but is also about to become known for having the country's greatest—I use that word advisedly—infrastructure fail, and that is the failure of Paradise Dam. It is a massive and serious infrastructure fail, where a 14-year-old dam is being emptied, in KGB-esque secrecy. There are very serious concerns held by the community, because the Queensland Labor government is refusing to explain to local farmers, landholders, families and businesses why it is flushing 105,000 megalitres of water—this liquid gold, in the middle of a drought—from the Paradise Dam out to sea.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The silence coming from the Palaszczuk Labor government is deafening. They won't say why they're reducing this dam's capacity to just 42 per cent. So, in Queensland, we have a Labor government who are not only not building dams; they are emptying dams. They won't specify what safety issues they've identified with the dam which have led to the sudden release of water. They won't say whether they've explored any other options for the use of the water that was released into the Burnett River and wasted, flushed out to sea—water that could have been used to fight the fires that are impacting upon the region as we sit in this chamber or that could have been used to help ameliorate the drought. They won't say if the dam will ever be restored to its previous capacity. They won't say whether any flood modelling has been done in relation to the decision. They won't say anything.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the greatest infrastructure fail ever in Australia—a dam that was built only 14 years ago, at a cost of tens of millions of dollars, is now about as useful as a chocolate teapot. There are secrets hidden in the Kremlin that have a greater chance of being exposed than state Labor telling us the truth about this infrastructure fail. The Queensland Labor minister responsible, Anthony Lynham, has managed only to say that the release of water is due to an 'unspecified safety issue'. For a government to simply float a suggestion of a safety issue with a dam amongst a community that endured significant flood events just a few years ago is irresponsible at best and ignorant at worst.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I join my federal colleagues Keith Pitt and Ken O'Dowd in supporting Deb Frecklington and local state MPs Steven Bennet, Col Boyce, Ted Sorenson and David Batt, along with the Bundaberg mayor, Jack Dempsey, and the LNP in Queensland in their call for a parliamentary inquiry into Paradise Dam. With the drought continuing, bushfires burning and summer around the corner, there simply cannot be any more secrets. The community deserves to know what is wrong with this dam, when it will be fixed, why the secrecy, what Labor have to hide and what the dam plan is in the meantime. These are basic questions that any government should be willing and able to answer. Queenslanders are instead being fed a diet of silence interspersed with Labor yibber-yabbering talking points.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Palaszczuk, when she was elected Premier, promised to be open, transparent and accountable, and it is time the Premier stopped hiding the bureaucrats, put an end to the secrecy and delivered the answers this community deserves. A massive infrastructure fail like Paradise Dam cannot be hidden forever under the sofa in the Premier's office. Instead of state Labor pulling the plug on this dam, Queensland needs to pull the plug on this state Labor government, who have given Queensland the nation's biggest infrastructure fail.</span>

A fierce advocate for support and assistance animals is Mr Andrew McGowan. I really want to give a shout-out to Andrew, because he is here tonight in the gallery with his two support dogs, Essie Girl and Zeus. I would also like to thank the Black Rod and others who ensured that the two dogs were able to enter the parliament. Andrew, as I said, is a fierce advocate for survivors of child sexual abuse. Earlier this year he walked 500 kilometres in 30 days to bring Chelsea Dog and Essie Girl to parliament to meet with the Prime Minister and other MPs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A survivor himself, Andrew's mission is to raise the profile of the vital role of service dogs to help people like himself manage their daily lives. For many survivors, a support animal, particularly a dog, can be an enormous help. Andrew said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">For 2 years Chelsea Dog gave me a reason to get out of bed when all I wanted was to die. I was responsible for walking her, feeding her and shopping for her food which I hated because I had to be around people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was lucky enough to meet Chelsea Dog earlier this year, but sadly she is no longer with us. Her resting place is near Bulahdelah in New South Wales, on a farm that is loved by Andrew and his dogs. Andrew has since rescued another dog.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was a member of the Joint Select Committee on oversight of the implementation of redress related recommendations of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. In that committee, we heard that survivors of child sexual abuse all go on to live different lives and their trauma manifests differently. We heard many times that many survivors experience PTSD, which often manifests itself as nightmares, fear and anxiety of going out into the world, and a deep mistrust of strangers and people in authority. At a public hearing in Newcastle in 2018, a survivor told us how helpful having his own support dog would be for him. He told us:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A lot of the companies that they talk to, when they explained my PTSD, said they'd give me a dog tomorrow, but our government won't acknowledge our PTSD. They won't recognise us and give us the permits for those dogs. That dog basically becomes useless. We can't go into hospital for two or three weeks at a time and have the dog. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">For me, with my nightmares every single night—my poor wife has to go through hell every day with me, but that's another story. Every night, I usually end up on the couch downstairs with all the lights on. I'll wake up after a nightmare and am frightened one of my monsters is in the house somewhere, so I have to finally get up the courage to look over the other side of the couch, look under the pool table, check the doors are locked ...</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was explaining to us the importance of support dogs. PTSD support dogs are trained to reduce the impact of specific symptoms of people living with this condition and improve their overall quality of life. Assistance dogs can help guide those living with trauma back to a sense of safety, helping to improve interpersonal connections, encourage engagement in the community and regain areas of functioning that may have diminished because of their trauma. But it's expensive to maintain the permits and accreditation for these dogs, and we know that many survivors are living on low incomes and in poverty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also inconsistencies in regulations between states and territories regarding which dogs can be registered with a form of accreditation. The Disability Discrimination Act has a legal definition of assistance animals, but there are inconsistencies between states and territories. All of this adds up to the fact that it is extremely difficult for people across Australia to access support dogs and get them trained—because that's expensive—but many argue that you don't need some of the specific training, depending on how they're helping people. I urge the government to take action on this issue.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:51</span>):  I rise to raise serious concerns about the failure of Victorian Labor MPs to stand up for their communities on a number of very significant issues, particularly in relation to infrastructure investment. I call out the member for Corio, Mr Marles; the member for Corangamite, Ms Coker; the member for Ballarat, Ms King; the member for Bendigo, Ms Chesters; and federal Labor members who represent communities in Melbourne's west, including the member for Gorton, Mr O'Connor; the member for Lalor, Ms Ryan; the member for Gellibrand, Mr Watts; and, of course, the member for Maribyrnong, Mr Shorten. I think it's fair to say that most in Labor also believe that Mr Shorten has failed them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The failures are significant and they are deep, including the failure to back a better regional rail link. The Regional Rail Link has, for many years, been an absolute disaster. It has ground to a halt in so many respects over so many years, letting down communities in Melbourne's west, as well as communities in Geelong and beyond, all the way through to Warrnambool. It's only now, with our commitment of $2 billion for faster rail between Melbourne and Geelong, that our government, the Morrison Liberal government, has a solution to deliver faster, more efficient rail. It is regrettable. I've already spoken out about the fact that the Victorian Treasurer, Tim Pallas, has suggested there might be some clawback in relation to faster rail and has questioned the need for a high-speed, dual-rail tunnel between Sunshine and Southern Cross. This will not only impact on faster rail between Geelong and Melbourne—and, of course, that extends all the way through to Warrnambool—but also impact on the ability of communities in Melbourne's west to receive the rail services that they deserve, as well as communities in Ballarat and Bendigo.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I call on Daniel Andrews and his government in Victoria to commit to the full fast-rail commitment, which is $2 billion—plus there is another $5 billion that our government has committed to the Melbourne Airport Rail Link. This high-speed, dual-rail track—this tunnel—is critical for all of those connections. The Labor members I mentioned have failed to back the East West Link. There was deafening silence in relation to Daniel Andrews's cancellation of the East West Link, which cost Victorians $1.3 billion. Our government committed $4 billion for the East West Link, in the east of Melbourne, but this was rejected by Daniel Andrews and his government, and none of these Labor members has said a thing, when we are crying out for better infrastructure in Victoria. All we have is the poor cousin, the West Gate Tunnel, which will save commuter time of only up to about 10 minutes. It's a massive infrastructure project which is simply not delivering for Melbourne's west and for the people of Geelong and Corangamite.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We now see Labor federal members doing nothing in the wake of Daniel Andrews's reckless decision to shut down the native forestry industry, which will cost nearly 5,000 jobs and $300 million—another terrible decision for regional communities across Victoria. Labor federal MPs are doing nothing. The member for Hunter, Mr Fitzgibbon, has called out state Labor over its failure to back onshore conventional gas exploration and extraction, but, again, local Labor MPs in Geelong, in Corio, in Ballarat and in Bendigo have done nothing. And, of course, we won't forget the words of the member for Corio, Mr Marles—which will haunt him, I think, for the rest of his days—when he said that it would be a good thing to see the collapse of global coal markets. I think that is one of the reasons that Labor did so poorly at the federal election. People working in our coalmines, working in regional communities, felt completely let down.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In so many respects, local federal Labor MPs are letting us down on infrastructure investment, on the investments that our communities need. I celebrate the incredible achievement that Avalon Airport is, as Victoria's second international airport, supported by a $20 million investment from our government. We know that, when Labor was in power, it stopped the development of Avalon international airport. I condemn Labor MPs for the damage that they are doing.</span>
