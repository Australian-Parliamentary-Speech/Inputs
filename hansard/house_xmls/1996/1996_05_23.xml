The latter two both rose to the rank of chief justice of their respective courts, they being the High Court and the Federal Court of Australia. I submit that we would have to go far and wide to find an individual who has made a greater contribution to public life than Sir Garfield Barwick.

        The seat was also held by the honourable member for Berowra, Phillip Ruddock, who is currently the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and who continues to serve the House with distinction. In more recent times, it was held by two members whose party is now on the other side of the House. I am speaking of the Hon. John Brown and the Hon. Paul Elliott, my opponent in the campaign.

         seeking to retain his nomination. He is present at virtually every function in my electorate. I submit to the factional leaders of the Labor Party, who we are assured make these decisions, that he is entitled to another go, and I look forward to a similarly robust contest in three years time.

        Mr Speaker, it was a great campaign. It was not an individual effort but a team effort. A great number of those who made an outstanding contribution are with us in the gallery today. I would like to acknowledge my debt to the conferences of Berowra and Parramatta. I would like to acknowledge my debt to Phillip Ruddock, who, aside from giving me a great deal of personal support, managed to persuade his conference to weigh in heavily behind me.

        I note the member for Warringah, Tony Abbott, sitting here in the chamber. Can I just say that he is a magnificent envelope folder and letter stamper. I see that, from those humble beginnings, he has now been elevated to the executive. There were numerous others. The Chief Government Whip (Mr Cadman) went above and beyond the call of duty and gave very unselfishly to assist in my election. To him, I am indebted. I note also sitting in the front row is the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop), who I continue to believe is Australia's pre-eminent marginal seat campaigner.

        The contest could not have been resolved in the manner it was unless literally thousands of Australians voted Liberal for the first time in their lives. Those people have a legitimate expectation that we on this side of the House will deliver a different and better form of government and that I, as their new member, will be an effective advocate for their particular needs, hopes and aspirations. Might I say that the needs of Parramatta are not something to which I now refer as a matter of custom; I refer to them as a matter of pressing urgency for consideration by this House and, in particular, by those who sit on the front bench on this side.

        Mr Speaker, we need to look at the fact that the demographic centre of Sydney is Parramatta. The population has shifted ever westward, but the policy preoccupation of decision
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         makers has tended to remain on the northern and eastern suburbs of Sydney. I want to see Parramatta achieve its natural destiny as being the capital of western Sydney and Sydney's second CBD. The metropolitan planning study in 1988 conducted by the New South Wales government identified Parramatta as the natural second CBD of Sydney, but we have not delivered the economic and social infrastructure that the city needs in order to thrive and flourish in that capacity. I will continue to be an advocate for those causes
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I will also be an advocate for causes such as the University of Western Sydney, which is opening a new campus at Rydalmere, and for the heroic work of people such as Dr John Yu, Australian of the Year in 1996, who works at the new Children's Hospital in Westmead and continues to perform miracles daily for the children of this country.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Mr Speaker, the single most decisive issue and turning point in the campaign was the issue of youth unemployment. The people of Parramatta rose up with the people of Australia and said that the sustained level of youth unemployment at about 30 per cent was, in fact, unsustainable. They said, `Enough is enough.' They said, `There has to be a better way.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I confess that I went into the campaign with some deep-seated reservations about our approach to the issue of youth unemployment to date. Let me acknowledge that it has been an intractable problem not just for the previous government but for governments on both sides of this House over the years and for governments around the world. It is an issue for which I hope we can establish a degree of bipartisanship.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I note that in the first days of World War II Menzies offered to actually form a joint party government. Such was the menace of the external threat facing us as a nation. I suggest that youth unemployment is an issue of such menace and of such fundamental importance to our future as a nation that we ought to be able to establish a degree of bipartisanship.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I came into the election with grave concerns about the way in which the issue has been handled to date. I came into it with a fear that
        <break page="1214" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         the direct interventions of government into the labour market had been spectacularly unsuccessful, and I thought we had to find a different solution. I set about to re&amp;hyphen;position the whole discussion about the youth unemployment problem in Parramatta—not as a government problem that was going to be solved by some nameless, faceless, bureaucrats in Canberra—and I challenged the local business community to take ownership, to step up to the plate and say, `These are our children; this is our future, and we are not going to wait around like a group of mendicants with our hands out in the expectation that someone else is going to come along with some Messianic ability to solve the problem.'
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So, we launched the Parramatta youth jobs initiative. I acknowledge my debt to the numerous people who responded to the call, even in the context of an election campaign. They did not come to support me personally or to support the Liberal Party; they came because they wanted a fresh approach to the problem of youth unemployment—the fact that we had 4,000 young people between the ages 16 and 25 in Parramatta who could not find a job. We established a mentoring program where individuals could volunteer to take a young person to help them write a CV, a letter of application, to understand what their skills were, to identify their talents, and to be introduced to employment opportunities.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We worked with the 1/15 Royal New South Wales Lancers—one of Australia's oldest military regiments, which has agreed to provide two days paid training to any young person who is looking for work. We had businesses come forward and say, `Yes, we would like to help in giving young people jobs.' Route 66 spent the last week in my office interviewing 1,000 young people for a new restaurant that they are about to open. I am delighted to say that 100 new jobs for young people will result from that initiative.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        My concern is that overarching involvement of government in these issues can actually weaken the muscles of self&amp;hyphen;reliance without which none of these problems are going to be solved. That leads to the question of one's personal philosophy: what are the motivating drives that cause one to aspire to occupy a
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         seat in this place. Naturally, when one considers such issues, the emblem for me is found in the year 870 and in the person of King Alfred the Great. King Alfred is an emblem of virtually everything I believe in. His first act as king was to collect together all the laws that had been passed by those who preceded him into one document and have them translated into English, undertaking much of the task himself. And, in doing so, he laid a stake in the ground for the principle of the rule of law.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        His second act was to declare that every member of that community, from the least to the greatest, would be subject to the rule of law, including himself. Then he went out in an act of what I regard as heroism and organised the forces of Wessex and Mercia to resist the onslaught of the Danes when the largest Danish army ever to set foot on England came over in 860. The writing seemed to be on the wall that the English would be destroyed like the Britons before them. But, by combining the two kingdoms, he was able to resist with such ferocity that the Danes were forced to negotiate the Dane law—which proved to be a line in the sand preserving parliamentary democracy and in my view Western civilisation, without which we might all well be speaking Danish today.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        He then established the principle that individuals can make a difference; that we are not mere pawns, mere subjects of faceless, inexorable historical laws. I quote Paul Johnson, the eminent historian. On reflecting on Alfred, he said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        He is a demonstration of the fact that one individual with sufficient clarity, single-mindedness, energy and will, can thrust his shoulder against the hinge of history and shift the equipoise and thereby achieve the work of multitudes.
       </para>
       <para>
        So we in this House uphold the principle of liberalism which says that individuals can make a difference—and if one can make a difference, what can 148 of us achieve in this place?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I mentioned my concerns about the overarching reach of government. The statistics in relation to the proportion of the gross domestic product which is consumed by the Commonwealth provide a stark assessment of
        <break page="1215" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         the position. In 1934, at the height of the Depression, Commonwealth consumption of the gross domestic product was 11.1 per cent. By 1955, that figure had doubled. By 1995, the figure was 28.1 per cent. When you add to that the spending by all other levels of government, the figure rises to 37.8 per cent, or $176 billion expended by governments out of the total gross domestic product of $455 billion.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I am not advocating the abolition of the state. I am not suggesting it has no role, but I am suggesting it has gone too far. I am suggesting that enough is enough. I am suggesting that, when mum and dad out there in Main Street have to go to work all day Monday in the shops and in the factories and come home at the end of the day without having generated the first dollar for themselves and their families, it concerns me. When they have to return on Tuesday morning knowing that they will work all through the day until afternoon tea before they generate their first dollar, I suggest that we are upholding an incredibly powerful disincentive to initiative, enterprise and employment.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        My feelings on the issue of youth unemployment and on the need for self-reliance are influenced by my family's own experience. We came to Australia in 1837 aboard the ship

        —200 Camerons travelling stowage third class. We came as crofters, from the Highlands of Scotland, who had failed to develop the skills which would make them competitive. As the Industrial Revolution swept up in a wave through England, they were smashed against the rocks. They had no basis upon which to resist. Their cottages were burnt down. They were forced onto the boats and flung, as the flotsam and jetsam of the Industrial Revolution, to the four corners of the globe—to places like Nova Scotia and New South Wales. Australia's gain was Scotland's loss. Nonetheless, I would prefer that we had been coming as a matter of deliberate choice and not as economic refugees.

        My grandfather—who was a patriotic Australian; he was in the saddle in Australian uniform at the last charge of the Light Horse at Beersheba—was a blacksmith. But when he

         returned to Australia, he found that his skills with the hammer and the anvil were simply not the skills required by the emerging economy as the motor vehicle replaced the horse and sulky. So he drifted around from one clerical position to the next until he, my grandmother and my father, their own child, came to Sydney to occupy a council flat in Concord.

       <para first-indent="16">
        So, Mr Speaker, I feel these issues quite intensely, and I refuse to stand by and watch the young people of Parramatta, likewise, become the victims of the third wave as the information revolution sweeps across this country. We must work to equip them with a set of skills which are relevant to the industries which are emerging and not those which are passing away. We must work to keep alive that spark of ownership and self-reliance within the community without which none of our efforts as a government can ever be successful.

        None of us arrives in this place without the assistance of numerous others who have made a contribution by way of inspiration by example. There are literally hundreds whom I could name, but there are a couple I particularly want to place on the record. I am indebted to the Hon. Neil Pickard; he is a man who has been much maligned but, in my opinion, he is a great Australian. I note, just for example—and I could cite many—that when my father had a heart attack, which almost terminated his life and certainly terminated his parliamentary career, Neil got out of bed at 1 o'clock in the morning and drove to the other side of Sydney to be with my family and me. I remain indebted to him.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I am indebted to people like Bruce Baird, one of the most effective ministers that the New South Wales government has ever produced; he has been a friend and mentor and encourager of young people throughout his public life. I am indebted to my firm, Blake Dawson Waldron, who went above and beyond the call of duty in their support of my political aspirations.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Can I say to the businesses of Australia: I encourage you to seek to identify with the aspirations of your employees. If our party, if our philosophy, ever becomes subject to any

         sectional or class interest, it will be weakened to that extent. I challenge businesses to get involved in the problem of solving some of these intractable issues we face, and I note that we only give 0.5 of a per cent in philanthropic giving in this country as opposed to something like four times that amount in the so much maligned United States.

        Mr Speaker, I am indebted to my family, which is an extraordinary group of people. My sister Margaret is not here today because she is in Uganda running a local high school; she is one of the most inspiring young Australians I have ever met.

        I am indebted to my father who many, particularly in New South Wales, will know of as a crusader, a campaigner, a person who was prepared to stand up for his convictions—whether or not they were popular, whether or not they were controversial. But I appreciate some of his more human qualities which tend to get lost in the fray: his respect for his opponents, his courtesy, his genuine liking of people and his belief that a difference of opinion, no matter how violent, ought never to impact on the quality of a personal relationship.

        I am indebted to my wife, who is the most wonderful companion a man could ever ask for.

But she has been a wonderful comfort and support to me in this period of enormous change in my life.

        The supply bills—Supply Bill (No. 1), Supply Bill (No. 2) and Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill—that are now before the House represent the first steps in budgetary provision for the year 1996&amp;hyphen;97. I want to say quite a bit about the budgetary policy for 1996&amp;hyphen;97 and beyond. Before doing so, I emphasise that the economic circumstances in which this budget for next year is being put together are infinitely better than the economic circumstances which the Labor government faced when it came to office in 1983.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Instead of an economy in recession, with double digit unemployment and double digit inflation, we now have an economy experiencing a record period of growth, which has created more jobs in the past three years than the Fraser government created in 7¼ years. The now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) bequeathed us an inflation rate of 11.4 per cent when he ceased to be Treasurer. Today, it is 3.7 per cent. He produced an average 50,000 jobs a year in the period that he was Treasurer. Under Labor, it was 160,000 jobs a year. He left 158,000 youth unemployed. Labor has left 88,000—a point I would particularly draw to the attention of the member for Parramatta.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As Treasurer, Mr Howard achieved average economic growth of 2.2 per cent. We achieved average economic growth of 3.7 per cent. Foreign debt increased under Treasurer Howard by 35 per cent per annum. Under Labor, it was half that rate. He handed over a highly regulated, highly protected, uncompetitive, inward looking, dispute ridden, sclerotic economy. He now takes charge of an economy that is substantially deregulated, lowly protected, outward looking and export oriented, very competitive, much more productive, and with far lower levels of industrial disputation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are still things to do—there always are—but there is no gainsaying the fact that the Labor government handed over an economy in infinitely better shape than it received 13 years ago. Even with regard to the budget, the outlook is vastly better than that left by the Fraser government in 1983. The revised
        <break page="1217" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         budget figures—about which I will have much to say—released by the new government show a projected budget deficit for next year of one per cent of GDP. That compares to a deficit of just under five per cent of GDP left by Treasurer Howard in 1983. When the government talks about budget black holes, it should be damn thankful it is not left with Howard's humungous hole—if I can use that colloquial expression.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A great deal has been made of the revised budget estimates by the new government. The former Labor government has been accused of economic mismanagement, failure and deceit. On the basis of the alleged budget hole, a major change to fiscal policy has been announced, involving taking measures to cut the budget by some $4 billion in 1996&amp;hyphen;97 and the same again in 1997&amp;hyphen;98. I want to make a number of points about these new budget figures and the allegations and policy changes that have resulted from them.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Firstly, I completely repudiate the allegation of deceit. The fact is that the Labor government provided far more information regarding the prospective budget than its predecessor government ever did. Treasurer Howard provided virtually no information at all about the out&amp;hyphen;year budgetary situation. With one notable exception, he only provided information for the current budget year.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The exception was during the 1983 election when he made up his own figures, even though he later admitted that he had different figures provided to him by Treasury. He confessed after the election that he had been told by Treasury before the election campaign of an $8 billion budget deficit forecast for the next year and that that figure was subsequently revised up to $9 billion a week before the election, and then to $9.6 billion the day before the election. None of those Treasury estimates were ever released before the election.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What was released by the then Treasurer, now Prime Minister, during that election campaign was the figure of $6 billion for the next year's budget deficit, which he later justified, saying it was a personal estimate that he was entitled to produce having been Treasurer for five years.

         In the light of that disgraceful performance, it is extraordinary that the perpetrator now has the hide to accuse the Labor government of deceit, particularly when that government provided far more information about the budget outlook than he ever did. All of it, I must say, was official estimates; none of it was personal estimates.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The Labor Party brought in three&amp;hyphen;year forward estimates of outlays early in our period in office. We brought in three&amp;hyphen;year forward estimates of revenue and, therefore, of the whole budget outcome, a couple of years ago. We brought in a mid&amp;hyphen;year review of the current year budget. We brought in a fiscal framework which set out at the beginning of the budget preparation process the economic and financial framework in which the budget was produced.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Despite all this information, which no previous government had ever provided, we are accused of deceit because we did not update the out year budget figures when we announced the mid&amp;hyphen;year review of the current budget last December. That was totally consistent with our original decision when we introduced the concept of the mid&amp;hyphen;year review for the current budget year a couple of years ago, which was not to revise the out years in between budgets.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We took that decision, not to hide worthwhile information from the public but because, obviously, unlike the current year, for the out&amp;hyphen;years we did not have any experience of what had happened during the year—that is only something that was there for the current year. Also, we knew from experience over the previous decade and more that the initial budget starting point, which we obtained at the start of the budget preparation process, always varied considerably, sometimes enormously, through the budget preparation period. It did so because of changes by Treasury and the joint economic forecasting group to the economic forecast, and also because of changes in program parameters. They delivered different outcomes for various reasons from what was expected.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Thus we concluded that to release the budget starting point figure at the start of that process, or to update the forecast for the out&amp;hyphen;

         This chronic unreliability of budget starting point numbers well before budget finalisation was acknowledged by the now Prime Minister after the 1983 election when he justified his non&amp;hyphen;release of official estimates for the next year's budget outcome by saying—and it has been mentioned by others in this House—that estimates of this kind are notoriously unreliable guides to the ultimate outcome. Of course, that is precisely what we said and that is why we did not release them, and then we were accused of deceit for not doing so!

         What we are now accused of is withholding information, which no government in the whole history of this country has ever released—with the infamous exception of 1983—information that would certainly be revised in future months leading up to the finalisation of the budget, and which information we had not sought nor obtained from the bureaucracy because the budget preparation process had not begun. We therefore completely and absolutely reject the allegation of deceit.

         Let me turn to the allegation of economic failure and mismanagement. This stems from the revised budget outyear figures which show the headline budget outcome for 1996-97 of $4.9 billion compared with the 1995 budget forecast of a $3.4 billion surplus and an underlying outcome for 1996-97 of a deficit of $7.6 billion compared with the 1995 budget forecast of a deficit of $0.6 billion. In the two subsequent years, the headline deficit goes down to $3.9 billion and the underlying deficit to $3.3 billion.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So why this change in the expected budget outcomes from those outlined in last year's budget? There are two principal reasons. The first is that the coalition in opposition deliberately undermined the budget. They tried to do this in 1993 when they opposed $3 billion worth of budget tightening measures. They were unsuccessful in respect of that. In this current year's budget, they opposed $2&amp;half; billion of budget tightening measures for
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          1995-96 and $4&amp;half; billion for 1996-97. So they tried to wipe out the projected budget surplus of $3.4 billion for 1996-97 by opposing $4&amp;half; billion worth of measures. So much for the professed concern, hand on the heart, about the need to have a budget surplus.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Why did the coalition in opposition oppose the measures which at that stage they would have believed would have wiped out the budget surplus anyway? They were successful in blocking $0.3 billion in 1995-96—which, I might note, is enough to stop a surplus this year on the revised figures—and they blocked $2.3 billion in 1996-97. Thus, in part, the deterioration in the budget outcome that they are now fulminating about was brought about by their own actions.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Nevertheless, the major reason for the changed budget outcomes is the change to economic parameters. As noted by the Reserve Bank governor in an address in late March this year, 90 per cent of the change in the underlying budget balance is due to revisions in the economic forecast which come from the December forecasting round by the joint economic forecasting group, which is made up of representatives of Treasury, Finance, PM&amp;C and the Reserve Bank.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So what are these changed economic forecasts? In part they reflect reduced real growth of GDP in employment—real GDP growth is down half a per cent in 1995-96 and 1996-97; employment growth is down a quarter per cent this year and one per cent in 1996-97—but in part they also reflect reduced inflation. The real gross non-farm product deflator, which is for the non-farm economy the complete inflation indicator, is down a quarter per cent in 1995-96 and three&amp;hyphen;quarters of a per cent in 1996-97, from 3¼ per cent to 2&amp;half; per cent. Thus the nominal level of GDP in 1996-97 has been lowered significantly by a combination of lower growth and lower inflation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As Treasury notes in the 12 March release of the revised budget figures, the level of nominal GDP for 1996-97 is now expected to be 2¾ per cent less than was projected at budget time and, for each one per cent fall in nominal GDP, revenue declines by $1&amp;half; billion. So revenue was down in 1996-97 by
         <break page="1219" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          some $4&amp;half; billion due to reduced real growth and reduced inflation. With lower growth, outlays are also increased, especially for increased expenditure on unemployment benefits.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Two key questions arise from all of this. The first one is: is reduced economic growth and inflation evidence of economic failure and mismanagement by the previous government? I must say it is a curious development indeed when lower inflation is said to be evidence of economic failure. It is what we were trying to achieve. In fact, the mark of the economic success of the previous government was that we achieved a substantial and enduring recovery with low inflation. The fact that inflation in 1996-97 is now forecast to be less than we previously forecast is clearly not a bad thing—well, at least I would have thought so. To argue the opposite is to take a complete
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Alice in Wonderland
         </emphasis>
         approach to economics. That is what the current government is saying. It is saying that lower inflation, because it reduces the expected budget outcome, is evidence of economic mismanagement and economic failure and therefore requires major budget cuts. This is just fairyland economics.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As to reduced growth, that is clearly what we do not want to see. Australia's performance on growth is still very good. We have had a record four and a half years of continuous economic growth. Our current, albeit reduced, rate of economic growth is still expected to be the highest for all the major OECD countries this year. To be bottoming out in the business cycle with a growth rate which still has us top in the growth league for comparable countries is hardly evidence of economic failure or economic mismanagement. The resultant revised budget deficit is hardly massive by the standards of other countries. In fact, at one per cent of GDP, it is almost the lowest budget deficit in the major OECD countries.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second key question that arises from these reduced economic parameters is whether this warrants the government's response of $8 billion of budget tightening measures. I would argue emphatically that it does not. The government's response is utterly illogical because it is a structural response to an essentially
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          cyclical problem or phenomenon. The changed budget outcome for the outyears does not represent a structural deterioration caused by wild government spending or programs running out of control; rather, apart from the damage caused by the coalition's own actions in opposition, it is overwhelmingly a cyclical phenomenon due to lower growth and inflation.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What if the cyclical change had been greater? Let us assume inflation had been one per cent lower in 1996-97. What would that have meant? On the government's approach it would have meant that we would have been a couple of billion dollars further down in the budget position; therefore, it would have required a couple of billion dollars more of expenditure cuts because we had a lower rate of inflation. What if the economy had collapsed? What if we had a recession like Treasurer Howard left us with—a budget deficit of five per cent of GDP, which would leave a budget hole of $28 billion? Would we require cuts of $28 billion in those circumstances? Clearly, on the government's logic we would since that would be the size of the black hole you would have to fill.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Such action would be utterly perverse. It would undoubtedly have major counterproductive effects on the economy as well as horrendous social effects. Indeed, even with the $8 billion cuts, this is likely to be so. This is because government cuts of $8 billion will of themselves have a contractionary effect on the economy. It represents a withdrawal of the three&amp;hyphen;quarters of a per cent of GDP in each year. Of course, it is argued that will be counteracted by a boost to confidence, especially business confidence.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But business and consumer confidence is already high. The December capital expenditure survey showed business expectations for capital spending for the first half of this year to be quite strong and for 1996&amp;hyphen;97 to be 27 per cent higher than the corresponding expectation for 1995&amp;hyphen;96. Of course, that was all before the change of government.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In such circumstances, it is hard to envisage that business confidence could be greatly increased and that that could lead to an additional splurge of business investment. So
         <break page="1220" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          we have the certainty of lost public sector demand versus the possibility of some offset in private sector demand. Already private sector forecasters like Westpac are saying that this will result in reduced growth of half a per cent in 1996&amp;hyphen;97 and 1997&amp;hyphen;98. With reduced growth it follows that much of the apparent gain to the budget from the budget measures will be lost in the net contractionary effect on the economy. So what we gain on the one hand from the budget measures will be, at least in part, offset by the lower growth that will occur.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Clearly, on the face of a cyclical rather than a structural deterioration, we should work on improving the cyclical outcomes; that is, try to increase growth, not inflation. There are good prospects of this anyway. The Governor of the Reserve Bank has publicly stated that his hunch is that GDP growth in 1996&amp;hyphen;97 will be a bit stronger than the current official forecast of 3¼ per cent.

         Since the revised budget figures were announced, the release of the December quarter national accounts showed GDP growth of 0.5 per cent. That compared with the JEFG, Joint Economic Forecasting Group, forecast for the December quarter of 0.2 per cent—0.5 per cent against the forecast on which the budget figuring was made of 0.2 per cent. Already we see that those numbers are out of date and it could well be that following the Joint Economic Forecasting Group round, which would follow those December national accounts figures, we will have additional estimates which the government has not released.

So out of the dry well of ideas of Labor, what can I offer as solutions to the people of Paterson? One of the chief mantras repeated over and over is the need to get our small business sector in Australia back into business. The issue resonates with people because the concept is so easy to understand—it is logical and it is right. Small business has long held regional and provincial Australia together. Without invigorating the small business sector right across Paterson, no new jobs will be created and existing jobs will be lost.

That is what it is all about: motivating small business to get people back into work. This is a two-way deal and, yes, it is a worthy partnership in the future of our nation. Small business will not change unless a decade of government neglect and abuse is overturned in the Hunter. The record closure of small businesses in Paterson destroyed confidence and brought a community to its knees.

         On terra firma there was also a similar scenario unfolding. I seek to remind the members of this House of the promises of the previous government, who said in 1990 they would deliver a $1 billion package to make over the Pacific Highway. The member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), who unfortunately is not with us in the chamber at the moment, sought when Minister for Transport to upgrade the highway's chief black spots, including the death trap of O'Sullivans Gap. Yet, for all his talk in promising new bitumen, he could not even deliver a bulldozer.

         The implied threat or otherwise of Newcastle disease and avian flu re-entering, however inadvertently, our country could have an enormous impact on both the chicken trade and the local environment. Within Paterson, chicken farming outranks all comers—dairy production and cattle included—as our biggest rural income earner. In light of the recommendation by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to lift the import ban on cooked chicken, I have to say I am saddling up with my local chicken growers to challenge this view. Disease knows no barriers of state borders or livestock crossings. As we seek to establish ourselves as the food bowl to Asia and increasingly the wider Western world, I owe it to my rural producers, their work force and their families that our primary industry sector sustains the premium price in the market place for the produce which disease&amp;hyphen;free food carries.

         —I would like to begin by congratulating the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) on his fluent speech and also on his sense of humour. I would like to talk about the Supply Bills and use that as an opportunity for talking about the strategy which the government is putting forward. It is an extra
         <break page="1225" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
          ordinary strategy, as the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) has shown so eloquently a few minutes ago. One of the most important things he showed is that the strategy is based on a serious misunderstanding about the nature of what is going on in Australia at present. As he showed vividly, the increase in the claimed deficit is due very much to the reduction in the rate of inflation. A reduction in the rate of inflation is what everyone in Australia wants, but its effect is to reduce the rate of growth of nominal national income, and therefore to reduce the rate of increase of revenue and so to increase the size of the deficit. That is a cyclical problem, as he said, not a structural problem. It is entirely inappropriate for that cause to be the justification for a structural response of the seriously damaging and destructive kind that is being proposed.

        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One very simple arithmetical way of showing the misunderstanding that the new Treasurer (Mr Costello) seems to have is to look at the figures. He is saying that in 1996-97 there will be one per cent less growth in GDP, about $5 billion. Yet he is saying at the same time that that reduction in GDP of $5 billion will lead to an increase in the budget deficit of $6 billion. So we have the extraordinary estimate that a $5 billion reduction in national income will lead to a $6 billion increase in the budget deficit, making the government worse off and the people of Australia $1 billion better off. That does not make sense. The figures are wrong and hollow. They need to be redone. The assertions about a so-called Beazley black hole are hollow. They are simply assertions, and no more. They are based on hollow economics and hollow arithmetic without any foundation. Simply to go on asserting them is no argument at all.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The figures are sloppy. They are `severely rubbery', as an earlier Liberal Treasurer said in the late 1970s, or I think it may have been 1982—in the Fraser government years. There is no crisis. It is important for the Australian people to understand this. Australia has one of the lowest deficits at present and, even if the government's estimates were correct, it would still have one of the lowest budget deficits amongst the advanced countries of the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         OECD. Even if we accepted their figure it would be the second or third lowest in the whole advanced country league table. As well as that, Australia's outlays and revenue collections as a proportion of GDP are the lowest in the OECD area, amongst Western advanced countries.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As I have been arguing in this place now for some years, we have one of the lowest public debts. Depending on how you estimate it, we have the fourth lowest or the second lowest debt, whether gross debt or net debt. It is clear that we do not have a problem of government debt. The issue of overseas debt is different, but overseas debt is principally private sector debt; it is not government debt. But in terms of our national debt, the debt of the government to the Australian people, we have the second or the fourth lowest amongst all advanced countries.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So on every count there is no crisis. Yet we are being presented with figures as if they were the basis for demonstrating a crisis and then we are told that they justify these terrible cuts. But not only do they not justify them—I will come to the cost of them in a minute—they are also counterproductive, they are perverse. More cuts will further slow down the rate of economic activity. They will have a contractionary impact on the Australian economy, and that will cause higher unemployment. A thoroughly sound estimate of that is that the rate of growth will slow down by about half a per cent a year in each of the next two years if the cuts are made, as has been discussed. That would reduce employment by about 40,000 in each of those years. So at the end of the two&amp;hyphen;year period we would be 80,000 jobs worse off. That is perverse. It is a serious misjudgment. What we should be looking for are policies that will increase the rate of economic growth. That is the challenge that the member for Gellibrand threw out this morning.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Why not aim for a four per cent rate of economic growth so that we will speed up the rate of employment creation? That strategy would, of itself, obliterate the budget deficit within a couple of years. What we should also be aiming for at present—which the government seems resistant to accepting—is a
        <break page="1226" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         reduction in interest rates. The inflation rate is falling and interest rates are being reduced overseas. We should be reducing our interest rates so as to stimulate private sector economic activity.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The preconditions for it are there. If they had not thrown away the accord, we would have had that reduction in interest rates already. But even without that incomes policy instrument, we do have the capacity now to responsibly reduce interest rates. The Reserve Bank should be doing that and the government should be recommending it.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One of the real tragedies of the strategy that the government is putting forward is that it seems to have abandoned the goal of full employment. Nowhere in the Governor&amp;hyphen;General's speech was there a clear commitment to full employment. The government talked in very general terms about wanting growth in employment—and I do not doubt that it does—but it does not seem to be committed to the goal of full employment any longer.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Certainly the Treasurer is mocking even the goal of five per cent unemployment by the year 2000. He was quoted in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Australian Financial Review
        </emphasis>
        shortly after the election as saying that was always a fantasy and that there was no way it is possible, in effect. That is simply not true. It would have been possible and, by criticising that goal, he is demonstrating that the government is no longer even seeking that goal. That is a tragedy for the Australian people and a particular tragedy for those people who are going to lose their jobs as a result of the policies that have now been put in place.

       <para first-indent="16">
        There are really severe costs resulting from these proposed cuts, and it seems that the government is quite lacking in comprehension about the costs of what it is proposing. There seems to be an incomprehension about the importance of human services and what they do for the Australian people. What is good government about? Good government—at least in part—is about maximising the growth of employment, maximising security and improving and maximising the quality and accessibility of the services the government provides for the people. That is what people

Public health is one of the most cost&amp;hyphen;effective areas of health expenditure that you can imagine, because it encourages people to live healthier lives and it deals with major health problems in ways that reduce ill health before it occurs. To cut back on those public health programs is to undermine a demonstrably cost&amp;hyphen;effective area of government expenditure and it will also undermine the health of the Australian community.

         quality of service to people who need it at the most vulnerable time of their lives. I went with a constituent to the Social Security office in my electorate just a few days ago. I was very pleased to find that the waiting time was short, that the person behind the counter handled the client effectively and with good knowledge, and that the problem was dealt with quickly. I was impressed with that standard of service but, if staff is cut, that standard of service will be undermined.

We have heard of tax offices being closed, offices of the Family Court being closed and CES and Social Security offices being closed. No doubt there are many others. That really will reduce the standard of service and the accessibility of service in regional Australia. It is true that those offices are sometimes a little more expensive per client than are offices in the capital cities, but that is something that the Labor government was prepared to accept in order to ensure a high quality of accessible service in regional Australia. The new coalition government seems to have neglected people who, one would have imagined, it would want to represent effectively.

But it seems very likely that, since this is an idea that has been put forward in the past by Treasury and the Department of Finance and the coalition government seems to be of a mind to accept that kind of advice now, they will do so for exactly the same reasons as Treasury and Finance wanted to do it before, which was to use such a transfer as a cover for further cuts.

It is very easy for a lot of us, when we see our name on the ballot paper, to assume that people are solely voting for us as individuals. By the end of a long campaign, when you have knocked on endless doors and you have met what seems to be more people than could possible be enrolled to vote, you start thinking, well they're actually voting for me.

        After all the sacrifice and sheer hard work of the campaign, I guess it is natural that we indulge ourselves and imagine we are personally responsible for the swings we achieved in individual seats. But I am under no such delusion. Notwithstanding the strong, professional, hard&amp;hyphen;fought local campaign that my campaign team and I put in, I am entirely aware of why I am here and who the people of Forde voted for on 2 March. They voted for a coalition government and they voted for

        I would like to place on record my thanks to the Prime Minister and his family for their commitment to the Liberal Party and to the people of Australia, particularly during the campaign. Time and time again, as I doorknocked and spoke with the people of the electorate, I heard expressions of respect, trust and admiration for the member for Bennelong. It is a huge testament to him that, despite the fact that politicians are held in such low regard by many Australians, he has managed to maintain trust with the public over such a long period.

        As a Liberal Party member for over nine years and having stood as a candidate previously, I know that party leadership is crucial. It makes or breaks a campaign. For better or worse, it has become the wave upon which public opinion rides, which is why I know so many of us on this side of the House were delighted when the Labor Party adopted leadership as its campaign theme and slogan, for leadership is purely judged on achievements and outcomes. In that true sense, the Labor Party and its leaders over the past 13 years, particularly the former Prime Minister, failed miserably. They failed the Australian people and they failed the labour movement, as it once used to be.

        There has been a lot of speculation as to why people voted the way they did on 2 March. It is true that many thousands of people voted for change. But I do not believe they voted for change for the sake of change. It has really amazed me how condescending members opposite have been over the past few weeks about the depth of the message sent to them on 2 March. They seem to regard the results as some sort of aberration. They close their eyes to the damage inflicted on so many individual Australians by their years of mismanagement.

Well, that old class warfare is absolute rubbish and the people of Australia told them so on 2 March.

I am honoured and regard it as a great privilege to be representing such a diverse and beautiful electorate. Forde is a fairly new seat, having been formed in 1984. The composition of the electorate changed dramatically in the 1994 redistribution.

To the north of Beenleigh, at Loganlea, is the Logan Hospital. Like other public hospitals throughout Australia, patient waiting lists have grown to unreasonable proportions. Waiting times for public dental treatment are simply appalling. It is clear that the previous Labor government failed to match funding levels with the demands on this hospital. It has failed to recognise and plan for the rapid growth of this area.

If each of us could show the same concern today for all of our fellow Australians as we now extend to the families of those involved in the Port Arthur tragedy, then we could recognise and perhaps help those in our community who are in desperate need of help.

Working closely with the new state government to deliver a safer community for all Forde residents, particularly those in Eagleby, is one of my top priorities. Sadly, there has also been an increase in youth crime in rural areas, which for years managed to remain insulated from many of the problems experienced in the city. As regional unemployment has grown and local jobs have become more and more scarce, many local rural children face an uncertain future.

        I concur with what others have said in this debate: there is a rightful place for unions as workers' advocates but not as the controlling master of the government and not as blackmailers of employees. It is a travesty that during Labor's term in office the union movement received on average $14 million each year in the form of direct grants. In the decade preceding my election to parliament, I spent a great deal of time working with associations that assist disabled people—Multicap, the Queensland Spastic Welfare League and, most recently, the Handicapped Association. I can tell you that $14 million each year would have made a huge difference to those people struggling to lead normal lives and to the families who care for them.

She receives only one day every five months in respite care. Disabled people—yet another group ignored by Labor—disabled youth, the frail and the elderly, and particularly their carers, need more government and community attention. I would like to place on record my utmost respect for the many employees of associations I have worked with, particularly the Handicapped Association, which is now known as the Horizon Foundation.

During the campaign there was plenty of rhetoric about no-one being forced off awards and no worker being worse off and no big bang in industrial relations. But what has happened? The government proposes to introduce workplace agreements that will take precedence over award conditions. For example, in Victoria—where thousands of people fled Jeff Kennett's so-called reforms—people will lose the protection of a federal award. All that they will be left with is a workplace agreement that meets a handful of minimum standards.

The Treasurer has been widely claiming that the government decision in relation to the tariff concession scheme was a reduction of 40 per cent in the impact of a Labor government proposal on business. Businesses are always a special interest group closest to the hearts of coalition governments. But who picks up the difference for the reduction of this burden on business? The consumer; of course, the consumer—Fightback through the backdoor.

          Mr Deputy Speaker, you cannot get clearer than that, can you? According to numerous reports, this promise was laughed off as a joke by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, over dinner with the vice-chancellors. In question time on Monday, the Prime Minister refused to reaffirm his commitment.

          There have been suggestions that the coalition government will slash up to 12 per cent from the higher education budget. A cut of anything like this magnitude will leave the system—a system that has been incrementally improved since the days of Gough Whitlam—a ruin. Australia is now looking at nothing short of a headlong return to the days when university education was a privilege to be enjoyed only by the rich few. The Australian electorate did not vote for this.

          Another area we can look at is immigration. The coalition election commitments were also quite specific in the area of immigration and ethnic affairs. There was a commitment not to reduce the humanitarian and refugee program. Now it is revealed that there will be a fairly significant reduction. This is an open and direct breach of pre-election commitments. The baseline is to be reduced from 13,000 places to 10,000, with a corresponding cut in the refugee program from 4,000 places to 3,335. In a cabinet submission, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) has outlined the development of a strategy. But what is the strategy for? It is a strategy for hiding this breach of coalition election commitments. This example heightens concern about what the government has planned for other categories of Australia's immigration program.

           The coalition's statements on any issue before the election obviously cannot be relied upon. Earlier this week the member for Denison (Mr Kerr) pointed out a whole range of proposed changes in the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs that the government is implementing. They amount to a dismantling of bipartisanship on these issues and are of serious concern, given the coalition's rhetoric before the election. I share the concerns of the member for Denison about the impact of these changes on those who come to Australia from other countries and on the ability of the department to deliver services.

           Another area we should be concerned about is the environment. This government was elected on a clear promise to maintain all existing environment programs funded by the Labor government.

On the one hand, the Prime Minister has been suggesting in this House that members of the opposition who voted against the sale of Telstra legislation had no concern for the environment. I have already placed on record my total rejection of this spurious argument. But what do we see from the Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) on the other hand? He is quoted as saying, in reference to the National Heritage Trust Bill:

We get the answer: the underlying deficit. No&amp;hyphen;one, apart from the coalition apparatchiks, believes this to be a real number, certainly not an important number, but I am sure that many people in the electorate are confused by the repeated claims and counter&amp;hyphen;claims.

           If you examine the government's actions in the weeks since the election, there are two possible conclusions about this government, both of them equally grave for Australia. The first is that this is a government that has an outlook fixed in the 1950s and 1960s and that is acting out of a sense of nostalgia, attempting to change things back for the sake of it.

           The second conclusion—equally, perhaps more, ominous—is that the government is preparing to conduct an ideological experiment with policies that have been proven failures in the rest of the developed world. The longevity of the Labor government meant that until now Australia has been spared the excesses of ideologically driven free&amp;hyphen;market economic and social policy, often referred to as Reaganomics or Thatcherism. The government has no mandate for these pernicious policies, which have already been discredited overseas.

According to the author, this individualism has led to a viciously greedy form of capitalism. Not only has the role of the state been weakened by this but churches, charity organisations, sporting clubs and even families suffer because people withdraw from participating in society.

        Robertson is an electorate of contrast. It is a rapidly expanding area. It is an electorate of excitement and an electorate of challenge. The Woy Woy peninsula area, covering the towns of Ettalong, Umina and Woy Woy, has one of the highest percentages of older residents and veterans in Australia. It is an area populated by independent hardworking people who have supported themselves and their families all their lives and have asked for little help from others. But now as the years roll on, many of these people need help—help which they have not received from the Labor government.

        According to the 1991 census figures, 22.9 per cent of all residents in Robertson, almost one-quarter, are aged over 60 years and the vast majority of these people live in the Woy Woy peninsula area. Yet under successive Labor governments and Labor members in both state and federal parliaments, this area still suffers from inadequate public transport; poor roads; a lack of public housing; inadequate medical resources; poor job prospects, particularly for young people; businesses and shops that still struggle to survive; and schools that are overcrowded and underresourced.

        The people of the peninsula area are fighting back. On 2 March they decided enough is enough and they voted with their feet at the ballot box.

The voters now look to me as part of the Howard coalition government—as someone who is, and always will be, part of their community—to offer them hope for their future and their children's futures, something the Labor government has failed to do.

        As Robertson has grown, so have the pressures of modern life and the expectations on young people to perform and be successful. There is an epidemic sweeping the Central Coast—an insidious, evil epidemic—which is claiming far too many young lives. That epidemic is suicide. So far this year, in 16 weeks, 21 Central Coast people have taken their own lives. All but two of these have been men, mostly young men who could not come to terms with the pressures of life. If I achieve nothing else as a member of this government, it is my wish that I will help create an environment of hope and optimism, giving all Australians a sense of pride in themselves, their achievements, and their community. This challenge is one which we must all face together to build a better community.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I have faced many challenges in my life, and two of those I would like to mention today because those challenges are responsible for me standing in this place as the member for Robertson. The first challenge was to open a road—not just any road, but the Pacific Highway—between Sydney and Gosford. In 1991 the Pacific Highway was closed by a landslip, leaving no alternative road other than the F3 freeway. In other words, if the F3 was closed by weather conditions or accidents, which unfortunately are all too regular occurrences on this road, all towns and cities north of the Hawkesbury River were virtually cut off from Sydney.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <break page="1239" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
         The New South Wales state government at the time made the decision that the Pacific Highway was a low priority road and the road remained closed. In January 1993, despite being told by most people that you cannot change the mind of a government, I started a petition to reopen the old Pacific Highway. This campaign grew into one of the largest community actions ever seen in New South Wales, with support coming from all sections of the community, including local government, media such as the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Central Coast Ex press
         </emphasis>
         newspaper, and hundreds of other community groups. In all, over 30,000 signatures were collected on a petition which was then presented to the then New South Wales roads minister, the Hon. Wal Murray.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        On 3 June 1994 I had the privilege, alongside the then New South Wales state ministers, the Hon. Chris Hartcher and the Hon. Bruce Baird, of cutting the ribbon to mark the reopening of the Pacific Highway. The Central Coast of New South Wales had shown it had a voice—a voice that had to be listened to—and I had proved to individuals that a person can and will make a difference. At the time of this campaign, I held no public office nor did I represent any particular group. It was just the case of the whole community supporting a campaign for the good of the Central Coast.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second and biggest challenge I faced was to win the seat of Robertson for the Liberal Party. Again, I was told by many that it could not be done. It is 26 years since Robertson was last held by a Liberal member. In 1969 the seat was won by the Hon. Barry Cohen, who held the seat until his retirement in 1990, and the Hon. Frank Walker held the seat with a comfortable margin of 5.6 per cent until March this year. After 13 years of Labor government, the electors of Robertson wanted a change. They wanted to be represented by a local—a local who had a record of taking on challenges and standing up for the Central Coast.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        They wanted Robertson to be part of a Howard coalition government, and they made sure Robertson was part of this new government. The swing to the Liberal Party in Robertson was an incredible 9.1 per cent. Throughout the campaign, which was a long and hard fought one, I was supported by a small but hardworking team whose support had encouraged me to complete what many people said was an impossible task. The members of all the local branches did a fantastic job and, more than anyone else, can take great delight in and credit for our amazing win when you consider that they have worked year after year for the Liberal Party, having always done well at a federal level but never quite winning.

         —I join with the colleagues of the member for Robertson (Mr Lloyd) in congratulating him on his inaugural speech. I look forward to his contribution in this parliament. On 2 March the Australian people opted for a change of government but not a change of policy. On every contentious point of difference raised in the lead&amp;hyphen;up to the campaign, the coalition adopted Labor's mantle—not necessarily in the detail but certainly in the essence.

        As far as the responsibility I have in industry and regional development is concerned, the government's policy documents consist almost entirely of `me too' statements. There is no change to the diesel fuel rebate, the maintenance of support for export market development grants, the continued assistance for regional development initiatives at existing levels, the maintenance of the factor F pharmaceutical industry assistance package and the continued 150 per cent tax concession for industrial research and development. Even Labor's commitment to create 600,000 new jobs over the next term found a positive echo in the coalition's promise of 200,000 new jobs in the manufacturing industry. These of
        <break page="1241" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        These supply bills authorise the continuation of supply—the funds to government—under current policies; that is, under Labor's policies. Of course, that will not be the case after the budget. We know now, as we suspected during the election campaign, that the coalition has no intention of honouring its promises to maintain our policies. Assistance for industry, in the government's view, is simply business welfare. That is consistent with its ideological view that there is no place for government in the market.

        We hear from various sources daily the changes being proposed to schemes such as the development import finance facility, the export market development grants scheme, the Asian infrastructure consortia program and the R&amp;D concession. They all add up to a billion dollars a year in program assistance, which the government is about to cut. Add to this the increased pressures imposed on the manufacturing industry in this country by the appreciating dollar and you realise that it is not the time to cut the assistance.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But of course the government's view is that cutting spending has primacy, no matter what the cost or regardless of the consequences. I will give just two examples of this—statements that have been made over recent days by ministers on the government side. The Assistant Treasurer, Jim Short, told the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry council dinner last week that the government would be cutting industry programs that are effective and efficient. I can understand changes need to be made if the programs are not effective or are inefficient, but why get rid of the ones that work? Here is a deliberate statement to an industry that that is what the government is going to do.

        In addition, the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) has promised to shorten the period required for anti-dumping complaints but is persisting with a 10 per cent cut to customs staff that will make the promise impossible to deliver.

         We have seen significant growth in Australian manufacturing under Labor's reign. Australian manufacturing has been growing more quickly than almost any other major sector of the economy and since 1992 has grown by 26 per cent compared with economic growth overall of 16&amp;half; per cent. Australia's manufacturing productivity has risen by 16.8 per cent since the end of 1991, and over the last decade manufacturing exports have risen on average by 17 per cent a year.

         That occurred through policies developed by the Labor government. We created the environment and the assistance by which that growth could happen. It will not happen on its own, as our history has shown. We are not saying that programs should not be reviewed. Many of the programs which now face the axe have been reviewed countlessly and have come up trumps. Look at the reports and findings in relation to the export market development grants scheme. These have significant multiplier effects in the economy. Without the scheme we would not have exports. Those opposite profess concern about making the economy more competitive and correcting our balance of payments, yet they are going to cut the very programs that have assisted us in making some important headway.

         If as a nation we are to get unemployment down, we need to generate economic growth on average at better than four per cent. That we can do it has been shown over the past 4&amp;half; years, as the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) pointed out in an earlier contribution today. What also has been shown is that the constraint on doing better than four per cent economic growth is our balance of payments. The economic strategy that has to be developed, therefore, is one that addresses that constraint essentially by expanding our net exports. Whether it is export growth or competitive import replacement does not matter so long as the strategy is to expand net exports.

We took it from a protected, inward focused regime which was focused on producing essentially for a domestic market to one which is now internationally competitive and outward focu sed with significant diversification and already huge growth in export markets, to which I have alluded.

         There is agreement on the need to reduce tariff levels, to pursue micro-economic reform, to secure macro-economic stability, to lock in low inflation, to improve productivity and to lift our skills base. Both sides of the House seem to be in agreement about that. There have been essential elements in the progress that we have made, but in themselves they are not enough. Should we leave the shape and performance of Australian industry—so critical to growth, jobs and regional development—simply to market forces? Labor's view is that we should not.

         Labor in government did increase industry's exposure to competition and to international market forces, but at the same time it recognised that intervention was necessary to assist industries to make the transition to becoming internationally competitive.

         Whilst job opportunities in the manufacturing sector are limited, the sector is central to this economy because of its wealth creating and technological development roles. It is also the essential underpinning of a burgeoning services sector—the jobs creator. But free market economics does not work perfectly. Individuals and firms do not always act rationally. In some industries few firms compete in oligopolistic markets. Not all of our trading partners and competitors are committed to the same pace of change as us or indeed have caught up to where we are.

Knowledge within and about markets is not perfect, as the theorists would have us believe. The doctrine of `factor endowments' has been swamped by the ability of transnationals to pick and choose the location and operations of their businesses. In essence it is no longer a question of what you have naturally; it is what you do with it. We must be in a position where we are prepared to better value add the natural resource base and combine it with our obvious skills base.

         In this regard significant progress has been made under Labor's reign, but there still is much more to do. I am firmly convinced that it will not happen on its own. We have to support industry in the direction of the change we expect them to be part of. It is not good enough simply to urge industry to become more competitive and productive. We have to assist them to become so. Whilst we have worked well to remove the old protective policy regime and open up the economy with impressive results to date, we must do more now to develop the new policy regime.

          The debate on industry policy in this country has been debased. It has been simplified to a choice between the free market and intervention. My argument is that we need to look at these issues strategically, not polemi cally. In essence, the argument is one about reaching our potential in industries where we know we have strengths due essentially to the combination of our natural resource base and our skills base. The approach will increasingly involve regional applications in the context of national strategies and the accessing of  support programs. The approach must be industry driven, not government driven, so that the market structure and its competition are properly understood.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The response itself, as distinct from simply the approach, will invariably involve a partnership between government and industry to match the policy instruments to the circumstances, to achieve a proper balance between a market discipline and, where necessary, structural intervention to achieve the national objectives. It will involve a commitment by industry through targets to expand our traded goods and services to become more productive and competitive, but using the partnership to address the impediments which limit the achievement of those targets.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I happen to believe that a successful model in this regard is the approach that the previous government adopted in the agrifood industry, the food processing industry. I hope to have the opportunity in subsequent debates in this House to go into more debate about that approach. With government playing a facilitative role and being prepared to offer support to industry-driven responses committed to targets and to growth, we have seen a huge growth in food processing exports in this country.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is a target to achieve $10 billion of exports by the turn of the decade from what was a little over $2 billion just a couple of years ago. Even at $2 billion, the food processing industry in this country was the largest manufacturing employer in the nation, employing about 150,000 people. If we get this strategy right, as all the evidence suggests we will, and expand the exports, it is not just great for our balance of payments; it is terrific for jobs. This is what smart industry policy has to be about—not the programs that have assisted them to get there being cut from underneath them, because then you lose the leverage. Then you lose the basis upon which

         In government we established policies with broad application to many industry sectors, which I will refer to briefly here.

We have the export market development grants scheme, the DIFF scheme, the 150 per cent R&amp;D tax concession, the national industry extension service, better access to venture capital because of the changes that we introduced, and the establishment of Ausindustry and Austrade. Many of those programs will be cut by the government in its ideological drive to reduce business welfare to find the bottom line.

I see members laughing over there. I wonder whether, when they approach manufacturers in their industry, they are prepared to laugh in the same way about the insignificance of these programs when they will get swamped with submissions showing the importance of these programs to their growth. They are not props or handouts. They have been instrumental in improving our traded goods performance. Without them the same progress would not have been made.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I mentioned examples of those programs that had application across industry sectors, but there are also many examples under us of specific application to certain industries: the partnerships for development program, for example, in the information technology, a huge industry growth sector; the factor F plan in relation to the pharmaceuticals industry; the car plan; the shipbuilding industry—we saw the gutting of initiatives under the shipbuilding industry in legislation that you introduced yesterday; the coal export levy in relation to the coal industry; the support for the magnesium industry. All of these involve commitments by industry to increase our traded goods and services to invest in R&amp;D and all have delivered, but they have only delivered against the commitment because we were prepared to use the leverage and the initiative of government programs to ensure that they did, to work in partnership with industry to

         Labor's job in opposition will be to hold the government accountable to the promises they made during the last election, which we are showing increasingly these days were made duplicitously. We will continue to pressure the government to deliver on those promises, those things that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) went on the John Laws program to say, `I would rather make half the promises and deliver all of them than make all the promises and deliver half,' and who also said, `Even if it means the deficit going out, we will deliver all of our promises.'

        Political correctness is just one of the many things that seem to have got out of hand during the previous government's time in office. Education—and as a consequence jobs—is another. Young people are being kept at school until year 12 without any real consideration as to their wishes or, for that matter, what the needs of the community are. If young people were given a good general education until year 12, they could then make a decision about their future or their job path.

        Young people should be able to choose their future at year 10 and, if they wish, be encouraged to apply for an apprenticeship or a TAFE course, to enter the work force or continue to year 12. Whatever their decision, we as a government should make it as easy as possible for them.

Towards the end of secondary school, those who wish to go to university could devote 12 months to enable them to complete a university entrance exam.

        The Brisbane airport has been at the mouth of the Brisbane River since Kingsford Smith's time. The benefits of Brisbane's domestic and new international airports are their convenient location to the CBD and their accessibility to the main arterial roads that link the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast. Furthermore, both airports directly employ more than 5,000 people, with a further 16,000 related spin&amp;hyphen;off jobs. The annual economic impact of the airport to the region is estimated to be around $2 billion.

People in Port Adelaide told me before the election that they wanted Medicare to stay, that they wanted bulk&amp;hyphen;billing and that they wanted the current arrangements. They said that some changes could be made, but they tended to elucidate only three—changes that would improve Medicare, not destroy it. They wanted coverage for extra health services, such as physiotherapy, dental care, podiatry and chiropractic services. They wanted some financial help to make private health cover easier to afford. They wanted shorter waiting lists for elective surgery. We promised to make all three improvements to Medicare if we were re&amp;hyphen;elected. Unfortunately, we can be sure that none of these improvements to Medicare will now be made.

        I note with interest that the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General of New South Wales has plans for comprehensive privacy and data protection laws. The European Union has thus far set the standard and the New South Wales legislation will attempt to meet those same standards. There is a good reason for this: the European Union will soon reduce the information loop, restricting it to those states that have adequate privacy laws. By using the European standard, New South Wales hopes to maximise its opportunities for business. It also hopes to encourage other Australians to follow suit in

        The committee's final recommendations concern the establishment of a national privacy code and thus extend the protection provided by the information privacy principles to all confidential third party information. The proposal for such a code should be discussed by the Council of Australian Governments at their earliest convenience. The world has changed rapidly and will continue to do so at an alarming rate. The information superhighway has made the globe a smaller place, but it has created its own potholes in need of repair. We must be ever alert in ensuring that checks and balances are placed on governments in data collection and disclosure. We must not be left behind.

         —The backdrop to this supply legislation is the very harsh fiscal policy of the new federal government, which is essentially designed to decimate critical public sector functions in Australia; to slow the economy by reducing demand at a time when it has already slowed to a relatively painless soft landing under the former government; to increase uncertainty amongst many areas of the Australian community, not the least of which is the public sector; and to cause devastation in many regional economies across Australia as a result of job cuts in the public sector, withdrawal of services and consequential loss of economic opportunities that will flow from that.

         It is becoming clear that the chant from the new government in response to virtually any criticism about anything is going to be, `Beazley's $8 billion black hole.' Every question asked on anything to do with any form of expenditure, or any issue that relates to government decisions on any programs, is going to be met with the response, `Kim Beazley is to blame; there is an $8 billion black hole.' Interest rates are going up: blame Beazley's $8 billion black hole. Unemployment is going up: blame Beazley's $8 billion black hole. Foreign debt is going up: same response.

No doubt, journalists from other countries will eventually come and study Australia as an interesting case in peculiar mass hysteria because we will have people running across the length and breadth of the land all chanting, `Beazley's black hole.'

         Before it gets completely out of hand—and it is rapidly heading in that direction—we need to have a look at what we are actually talking about. What is going on with the finances of the Australian budget and what, precisely, is this government proposing to do? We are actually talking about a gigantic fig leaf being used to cover a number of things being done by this government. First, it is a
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          fig leaf to ensure that they can effectively fund a range of unfunded promises—up to $4 billion worth—and slip them in under the guise of blaming the former government for any cuts that have to be engineered in order to pay for those promises.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Some of those promises are going to be pretty interesting when they come to implementation. For example, they deal with tax cuts for people on incomes as high as $82,000 a year—the Australian battlers the Liberal Party is so keen to represent. When the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was on the radio during the election campaign, he did not get his lines right; he was not sure what the upper limit was. But it was demonstrated to him that it is likely that there will be some people on incomes as high as $82,000 a year who will be eligible for tax cuts.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         How are they going to pay for these things? How are they going to finance tax cuts for people on such miserly incomes as $82,000 a year—more, I might add, than politicians get paid? How are they going to fund those tax cuts? We will see cuts in child care, we will see cuts in social security, we will see cuts in aged care and we will see massive cuts in higher education. That is how they are going to finance their promises.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second part of the fig leaf is the introduction of Fightback. They went to the election saying, `We are changed; we are soft and cuddly and middle of the road; we are not nasty New Right ideologues any more. Fightback has been put back in the drawer.' But what are they doing now? All of the nasty cuts and all of the winding back of public services for people—all in Fightback—are being introduced one by one.

This government is going to slow it down further.

          The end result will be that it will create its own deficit.

          We are now left with Costello's con—Fightback without John Hewson. That means nearly $10 billion of cuts without a GST—yet. It means a balanced budget with no growth and no jobs. If the crisis is so serious, why is it that we have not had a mini&amp;hyphen;budget? Some 5&amp;half; months have elapsed between the election and the budget. The government is saying that there is this incredible crisis and that Australia has been left in a total mess by the former government—all sorts of nonsense of that sort—but it does not seem to be sufficiently important to have a mini&amp;hyphen;budget.

The reality that those on the other side are going to have to face in a couple of years is that their performance is going to be compared with the benchmarks left for them.

He is a minister who has said initially about Badgerys Creek, both before and after the election, `We are going to build it. We are committed to it. Labor will wimp on it. We are very strongly behind it.' He did not happen to mention to the people of Hughes and one or two other electorates around Holsworthy that he was thinking something completely different at the time.

          It is instructive to look at the transport budget because it provides in microcosm an illustration of what is actually happening in the public sector in this country. For 1995&amp;hyphen;96 its budget was $1.37 billion. Only $81 million of that was for running costs, of which $15 million was associated with safety administration. The coalition promises included an extra $147 million in the transport area: $28 million for Adelaide airport; $18.8 million for the Tasmanian sea highway in this forthcoming financial year; $65 million for the Pacific Highway; and $36 million for black spots.

           The only cuts it promised were the $27 million for the ships capital grants and PAYE legislation which we have just debated in the House.

So there is not much to cut. Almost all of the budget is in programs which are supposedly supported by the coalition parties. This is where the controversy about Badgerys and Holsworthy becomes so significant, because the forward estimates contain substantial amounts of money, over $500 million over two or three years, to provide for the construction and purchase of land at Badgerys. So now we know what is really going on. It will be very interesting to see those forward estimates on 20 August. Now we know what is really going on, and that is an attempt to rip out that money.

All of the major items in the budget are things that the Liberals have committed themselves either to maintain or to increase. No wonder they are looking for alibis, no wonder they are desperate to invent any excuse they can to lay waste to the public sector.

In the so&amp;hyphen;called free market or industrialised countries, which account for only one&amp;hyphen;fifth of the population yet remain a model for the rest of the world, work and work force, society and politics in the last decade of this century are all different significantly not only from the first decade of this century but also from what has existed at any other time in history. They differ in configurations, in their processes, in their problems and in their structures. Far smaller and slower social changes in the past have triggered civil wars, rebellion and violent intellectual and spiritual crisis, yet the extreme social transformations of this century have hardly caused a stir.

        I suspect that this century will be recorded as the cruelest and most violent in history with its wars, mass tortures, ethnic cleansing, genocides and holocausts. Hindsight clearly shows the three evil geniuses of this century—Hitler, Stalin and Mao—were destroyers rather than builders because they created absolutely nothing. Indeed, if this century proves one thing, it is the futility of politics because the social transformations of this century had little to do with political events.

        The age of social transformation will not come to a close in the year 2000 and the bad news for some in our community is that it will not even have peaked by then. One hundred years ago our society was dominated by the biggest single group in every country, the farmers. Today, however, farmers are at most five per cent of the developed world's population and work force. Traditional farmers are close to extinction and those who remain have become a protected species kept alive only by enormous subsidies.

        The second largest group in the population and work force of every developed country around 1900 was composed of live&amp;hyphen;in servants. Ninety years later, live&amp;hyphen;in domestic servants scarcely exist in developed countries. In the developed society of 2000, farmers will

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One of the main reasons why these transformations caused so little stir was that by the turn of the century a new class, the blue&amp;hyphen;collar worker in manufacturing industry—Marx's proletariat—had become socially dominant. By early this century society was obsessed with blue-collar workers. It was fixated by them, bewitched by them. Farmers and domestics were everywhere but as classes they were invisible. The new class, the industrial worker, was extremely visible. The people lived in dense clusters within and around cities and they soon proved eminently organisable with the first strikes occurring almost as soon as there were factory workers.

        Sorel found widespread acceptance of his 1906 thesis that the proletariat would overturn the existing order and take power through the violence of the general strike. Mussolini, Hitler and Mao built their strategies on Sorel's thesis. Mao's statement that `political power grows out of the barrel of a gun' was a direct quote from Sorel.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        No class in history has ever risen faster than the blue-collar worker and no class in history has ever fallen faster. The workers of 1913 received no pensions, no paid vacations, no overtime pay, no extra pay for Sunday or night work, no health or old age insurance, no unemployment compensation and, in fact, they had no job security whatsoever.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Fifty years later or thereabouts, in the 1950s, industrial workers had become the largest single group in every developed country. They had extensive job security, pensions, long paid vacations, comprehensive unemployment insurance and, in some cases, guaranteed lifetime employment. Above all, they had achieved political power. In Britain, for instance, they were considered the real government with greater power than the Prime Minister and the parliament.

        Some 40 years later, industrial workers and unions are in retreat. They have become marginal in number. Where industrial workers who made or moved things accounted for

         40 per cent of the work force in the 1950s, they now account for less than 20 per cent of the work force, that is, they are no stronger now than they were at the start of this century. I suggest that by the turn of the next century industrial workers will account for no more than one&amp;hyphen;eighth of the total work force. Union power in the community has been declining very fast.

        But just as the traditional farmer has become a recipient of subsidies rather than a major producer, so will the traditional industrial worker become an auxiliary employee. This is because the industrial worker has already been replaced by the technologist—someone who not only provides labour but also has theoretical knowledge. Industrial workers may soon become just another pressure group.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Contrary to the chroniclers of the rise of the industrial worker, the rise of this class caused neither a revolution nor violence. In fact, contrary to what Marx suggested, the industrial worker did not destabilise society. The history books record the squalor of early industry, the poverty of the industrial workers and their exploitation. Workers did indeed live in squalor and poverty and they were exploited. But they lived better than those on the farm or in a household and they were generally treated better. Proof of this was the decrease in infant mortality figures during this period. The drop in infant mortality can be directly related to the increase in living standards brought about by industrialisation. Industrial work provided farmers and domestics with their first opportunity in history to better themselves without the need to emigrate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The rise of the class succeeding industrial workers does not provide an opportunity for those industrial workers. In fact, it is a huge challenge for them. The newly emerging dominant group in our society is the knowledge worker. By the end of this century the knowledge worker will make up more than one-third of the work force. That sector will be as large as, if not larger than, the proportion that manufacturing workers made up in the community. The majority of them will be paid at least as well as, if not more than,

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        However, and this is the greatest challenge facing our country, the great majority of new jobs require qualifications that the industrial worker does not possess and for which they are poorly equipped to acquire. They will require a good deal of formal education and the ability to acquire and apply theoretical knowledge. They require a different approach to work and a different work ethic. They will have to change their mind&amp;hyphen;set. Above all, they will require a habit of continuous learning. At the very least they have to change their basic attitudes, values and beliefs.

        The fall of the industrial worker in the developed world will have a major impact upon those countries outside the developed world. Developing countries can no longer expect to base their development on their comparative labour advantage, that is, they cannot rely on cheap labour. It is widely believed, especially by labour union officials, that the fall of the blue-collar industrial worker in developed countries was largely, if not entirely, caused by moving production offshore. But this is not true. The main competition we have, internationally, is from countries that have high production costs so it cannot be that it is cheaper to go offshore.

        But the shift to knowledge based work poses enormous social challenges for our community, the knowledge community. This is the first society in which the ordinary people—and that means most people—will not earn their daily bread by the sweat of their brow. It is the first society in which honest work does not mean how many calluses you have on your hands.

       <para first-indent="16">
        It is also the first society in which not everyone does the same work. This is far more than a social change; it is really a change of human condition. What it means for the values, commitments and problems of
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         the new society we do not know because we are still going through this transition stage. We know that much will be different and that that then leads to a continuing feeling of uncertainty, and that is evident within our community at the moment. That feeling has emerged as the country's most constant social development. The knowledge workers will not be the majority in the knowledge society but they will be the biggest single population in the work force group. Knowledge workers will give the knowledge society its character, its leadership and its profile. They may not be the ruling class but they certainly will be the leading class.

        Their characteristics, their social position, values and expectations differ fundamentally from any group in history that has occupied the leading social position before. For starters, knowledge workers gain access to jobs and social position through formal education. Knowledge work varies tremendously in the amount and the kind of formal knowledge required. Some jobs have low requirements, others much greater. You can compare a technician in Telstra to a brain surgeon. Some have low knowledge requirements whereas others have greater requirements. But even if the knowledge required is quite primitive, only formal education can provide it. Education will become the centre of the knowledge society and the school will become the key institution. What knowledge we must have and what quality of knowledge we must have will become very important issues for debate.

       <para first-indent="16">
        These are questions we need to put to policy developers. It will become a major political question as we move into the 21st century. In fact, the application and distribution of knowledge may come to occupy that place in society that the acquisition of property and income over the last two or three centuries once occupied. That period has become known as the age of capitalism.

        Clearly, in the knowledge society more and more knowledge, especially advanced knowledge, would be acquired well past the age of current formal education. School as we know it would become the most vital and greatest concern to the new society. Increasingly, the educated person will become somebody who

On it will depend the ability of the knowledge society to give decent incomes and dignity and status to non&amp;hyphen;knowledge workers. The possibility of acquiring knowledge will no longer depend on obtaining a prescribed education at a given age. Learning will become the tool of the individual, available to him or her at any time of their lives. In the new knowledge society there will be no poor countries; there will only be ignorant countries. The same could be said for companies, industries and organisations of all kinds, and it is also true of individuals.

        Historically, workers have been generalists. They did what had to be done, on the farm, in the household, in the craftsman's shop. It is also true of industrial workers. But knowledge workers, whether their knowledge is primitive or advanced, will be defined as specialised. It demands for the first time in history that people with knowledge take responsibility for making themselves understood by people who do not have the same knowledge base.

        Most knowledge workers will spend most, if not all, of their working lives as employees. But the meaning will be very different to what we traditionally consider the word to be.

        Legally, each is an employee, but collectively they are capitalists, increasingly so through their pensions funds. In the knowledge society the employees will own the tools of production. Increasingly, the true investment in the knowledge society is not the machines and the tools but in the knowledge of the knowledge worker. Without knowledge the machines, no matter how advanced and sophisticated, are unproductive. Therefore, we will need a new type of management and management techniques and training. Management, in other words, is a social function and

         its practice is becoming more of a liberal art. For managers, the days of treating your employees with disrespect are over. The greatest advantage that a manager can have these days is understanding that your assets actually leave at 5 o'clock every day and you hope that your assets turn up the following day at 9 o'clock. So we have to work towards understanding and managing these new assets because the assets are actually in the knowledge worker.

        In the course of the coalition's trade document there is also a commitment to ensure ongoing discussions with relevant chambers of commerce. There is a commitment that the views of relevant chambers of commerce will be taken into account by the coalition. That being so, I was interested to see recently a public comment by the Managing Director of the Australian Business Chamber, Mr Philip Holt, when he said in respect of the government's proposed abolition of the export market development grant scheme, a scheme which he described as helping small and medium business to get into export markets, that the proposed abolition was a major backward step for small and medium sized businesses. He said that it was the breaking of an election promise which would adversely affect job creation and increase the balance of payments deficit.

He has been done in by his political junior—his portfolio boss, the Minister for Foreign Affairs—who, as I understand it, has refused to provide him with access to expenditure cuts proposed by the

All of the concerns that have been expressed by the state premiers I completely concur with. They
         <break page="1270" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

       <para first-indent="16">
        To the extent that there are differences of opinion around Australia, I would hope those differences of opinion would not be about the objective, but rather the methodology. What the government has set about doing on this issue is to try to achieve a practical set of reforms to the Native Title Act. We are not in the business of trying to drive a wedge between different sections of the Australian community. The pastoralists of this country have a legitimate interest in obtaining security, the mining industry has a legitimate interest in obtaining security and the Aboriginal people have a perfect right to see that their common law entitlements are not taken away. In framing our approach, we have regard to all of those interests.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Quite plainly, the continued delay is causing a great deal of insecurity and a great deal of uncertainty. There are those who believe that the simple answer to the situation is to attempt to legislate the extinguishment of native title where pastoral leases are involved. I can understand why people would see that as a solution. One of the difficulties is that that solution faces a number of hurdles.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The first hurdle it faces is whether it is consonant with the election commitments made by the coalition and, on the best advice, it is not. The second hurdle is whether it is likely to draw the support of the necessary numbers in both houses of this parliament and I think, on a present reading, it is unlikely to do that. The third hurdle, even if it were to pass through this parliament, is whether it would then be immune from constitutional challenge and therefore be immune from creating a further delay and, in fact, a greater delay than an alternative that might be adopted. It should not be assumed that going down the route of legislative extinguishment will bring the certainty that the mining industry, the pastoral industry and the state premiers of this country so legitimately aspire for and have so legitimately called for in recent days.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is my view that in fact it may cause greater delay if we were to go down that path
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         than if we were to go down another path. The federal government, in proposing another path, is in no way unsympathetic to the views that have been expressed by the Premiers of Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia and by the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. We happen to think that the most practical way to get to the goal they want to get to is to go down the route that we have advocated. That is why our approach has been somewhat different and that is why there have been different views expressed on this issue over the past few days.

        I say to all of the opinion formers in this country, including the leaders of the Aboriginal community—and I have seen some remarks attributed to at least one of those leaders in the past 48 hours which were quite unfair in the description given to the attempts my government has made to find a reasonable solution to this problem—that we want practical reform to make the Native Title Act more workable. I want to give certainty to the pastoralists of this country, I want to give certainty to the mining industry and I want to protect the common law rights of the Aboriginal people. Our discussion paper and our goals in this area have been fashioned around those three objectives and I believe that what my government has put forward is the speediest, most effective and most practical way of achieving those three goals.

        If someone has been unfairly sacked, then they should have a right of appeal. But that basic principle is not really in contention here. What many people in the small business community properly feel is that the current system just does not work; it is not really fair to anybody. In fact, the current system seems to be designed more to destroy jobs than to provide any support for people who might have been unfairly dismissed. There is no question that the current system is tainting the whole of the work force and thereby proving to be a significant disincentive for many people.

        Let me in a practical way give the House some examples of some of the cases that have occurred under the existing system. I have been talking about small business, but the system has also had an impact in a wider way. For example, after there was careful examination of certain allegations, a university lecturer was sacked. The allegations essentially amounted to a claim that the university lecturer had sought sexual favours from female students on the basis that they would get better marks. Effectively, he was sacked by the university; under the Brereton law, he was reinstated.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A second case involved a major airline in Australia. An employee was using company records to harass both female employees and female customers of that particular airline. This bloke was given a fair hearing and he was sacked. In my view he should have stayed sacked; but, under the Brereton law, he was reinstated.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The impact for small business was highlighted in a very practical way last year when one of the small business organisations, as part of its regular advice to a small business that had received an unfair dismissal claim, said that if the matter got to a hearing the small business ought to put aside two weeks on average just for the matter to be heard. Mr Speaker, think of that from a practical point of view. If you are running a small business
        <break page="1272" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         yourself, putting aside two weeks is a major problem.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        And that is if they get to a hearing. Many cases are being settled. Why are they being settled? Because the legal advice has been that the average cost to defend such a claim under the existing system is about $8,000. The unfortunate truth of the matter is that, when a small business talks to their local solicitor, a lot of the time the local solicitor says, `If you want to make a commercial decision, you might as well offer them five grand, even though the claim might be completely baseless, because it will save you two weeks in court and possibly eight or 10 grand in legal fees.' That amounts to a form of blackmail and is unfair to all parties.

        Those are the existing laws. I believe that the defects of this existing system are very apparent and obvious to all. On that basis, we ought to have an expeditious change to that law so as to provide some relief for small business and, even more importantly, by providing that relief give a lot of people the chance to get a job that they have been denied under the existing system.

        In the case of the Greens it is a bit curious. Why is it curious with respect to the Greens?

The Greens are joining this unholy alliance to vote against a $1 billion environment package.

        Then we have the Democrats. The Democrats are the real vandals of democracy in this country. They are attacking the real mandate of the coalition government.

        I made this very clear before the election because in the judgment of the then coalition and in the judgment of the government there was a clear benefit in retaining the single desk.

         —I appreciate that. I am delighted to reflect, as the member for Batman invited me to, on what is contained in the legislation. I can tell the member for Batman a few things that are not contained in the legislation. To start with, the legislation does not continue the legal monopoly over the bargaining process now enjoyed by the trade union movement of Australia. Secondly, the legislation does not continue the prejudice against youth unemployment contained in existing legislation.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The third thing is that it does not continue the prejudice against employers and employees making their own bargains. The fourth thing the legislation does not contain is the immunity which is now contained in legislation which allows unions to conduct predatory conduct to destroy thousands of small businesses in Australia. I am also happy to say that the legislation, fifthly, does not contain
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         the preference for unionists contained in existing industrial legislation. Sixthly, the legislation does not contain the de facto protection for compulsory unionism. Seventhly, it does not contain a bias against those who want to make workplace agreements with their employers. Eighthly, it does not continue the collectivist approach to industrial relations.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Ninthly, and very importantly, not only will this legislation not discriminate against people who want to exercise freedom of choice at the workplace—not only will people be allowed to join or not join a union according to their choice—but, unlike the member for Hotham and the member for Batman when they ran the ACTU, this legislation will allow workers to decide whether or not to join a union; and, tenthly, having decided to join a union, they can join the union of their choice. That represents 10 responses of mine to the invitation of the member for Batman. Eleventhly, it does not contain a provision for a $3.05 per hour youth wage, nor might I assure the member for Batman does it contain a provision for a $3.05 per hour youth wage.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The attempt by the Labor Party to represent this legislation as in some way bringing in a youth wage is a pathetically dishonest attempt to misrepresent the provisions of this legislation. This legislation represents a new era in  Australian workplace relations. This legislation will do more to boost the productivity of Australian firms than any piece of legislation presented to this parliament over the last 20 years and, much to the annoyance of those who sit opposite, this legislation will improve the job prospects of young Australians.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It will enable young Australians to have more job opportunities and encourage the employers of this country to employ more young Australians. As much as the opposition might not like it, when this legislation is introduced and the Australian people understand its ramifications, they will see yet again that—so far from you people being the friends of the working people of Australia—the true champions of the working men and women of Australia now sit on this side of the parliament.

         —In responding to the honourable member for Batman, there were four elements of the legislation that I did not touch on. I take the opportunity afforded by this question from the member for Robertson to touch on those. He asked me what were the disabilities for small business of existing legislation covering industrial relations. There are more than four in fact, but let me confine myself to four.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The first of those was dealt with very adequately by the Minister for Industrial Relations when he talked about the unfair dismissal laws. All of those newly&amp;hyphen;elected members—members like the members for Paterson and Parramatta, both of whom made their maiden speeches this morning; they were both first&amp;hyphen;class contributions to this parliament—have touched on what I think would have been the experience of all of us during the recent election campaign: that, if you spoke to the men and women in small business in this country, the issue right at the top of their complaints list was the unfair dismissal law.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The unfair dismissal law, which has been responsible for destroying more jobs over the last three years than any other legislative act of the former government—the pride and joy of Laurie Brereton—without any warning, without any commitment, without any mention, without any mandate, without any electoral authority and without consultation, was dumped by Laurie Brereton on the Australian public before the last election.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What was the explanation? You did not get it from the former minister. You got it from the now President of the ACTU, Jennie George. When interviewed on the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         PM
        </emphasis>
        program not long after the 1993 election she was asked, `Don't you understand, Ms George, that the employers of Australia object to this legislation? They haven't been consulted about it.' Do you know what she said? She said, `What the employers of Australia have
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         got to understand is that they lost the election and we won it.'
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That was the attitude. That was winner takes all legislation. Unlike the Australian Labor Party, we took our plans about industrial relations reform to the Australian people at the last election and they overwhelmingly voted for those plans, and that is why we are going to introduce them. So the first thing that is wrong about the present industrial relations laws for the small business community of Australia is the rotten, job destroying unfair dismissal laws.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second weakness of those laws is the way in which after the 1993 election you destroyed the effectiveness of the secondary boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act. Those provisions were brought in by the Fraser government in 1977. I am very proud to say that as Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs I authored those changes. I can well remember my discussions with the former Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, and the head of the Public Sector Union in 1978. They bitterly opposed those changes. They knew that those changes were going to make it very difficult and very painful for unions to destroy the business operation of many small firms in Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If it had not been for section 45D, the National Farmers Federation would never have won its historic battle at Mudginberri in 1985. If it had not been for section 45D, the former Queensland government would never have triumphed over unionism during the south&amp;hyphen;east Queensland power dispute. If it had not been for section 45D, many small businesses in Australia would have been driven to the wall. What was your response to that? Your response was to destroy the effectiveness of 45D and to expose small businesses to that kind of blackmail and thuggery. So that is the second weakness in the existing laws.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other two weaknesses are that the existing laws do not allow enough flexibility for people to combine their work and their family responsibilities. Many small firms are only too willing to make arrangements with their employees to allow those employees more effectively to combine their work and
        <break page="1277" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         family responsibility. But, unfortunately, the rigidity of the award system prevents that being fully realised. So we are going to do something about that—and you will find enormous benefits in the legislation.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Finally, and most importantly, for the first time in Australia's industrial relations history this legislation will allow people who genuinely want to make bargains at the workplace level without the unwanted, undesired and unnecessary intrusion of third parties, to make those arrangements to organise their workplaces in a manner which will boost productivity and protect the job security of the people employed.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Of all the groups in the Australian community who will benefit most from the workplace relations legislation to be introduced this afternoon, it will be the small business community of Australia—and that is why they will support us in even greater numbers at the election in three years time.

        In other words, you can be at work and you can be as good a worker as the person working alongside you, yet merely for the fact that you exercised your democratic right not to be in a union, you can have an employer pick the other one in preference to you, simply because of that fact. In other words, your entitlement, for example, to annual leave can be subjugated to this principle of preference under the existing law.

        It is absolutely incredible. In a society that prides itself on giving people a fair go and treating people on their merits, we have a system which has institutionalised a system of discrimination against people on the basis that they decide not to be a member of a union.

        It goes further than that because these matters can be in an award, you can be a small business operator under an award and you are required by law to discriminate against a person because they are not in a union. So it is a basic breach of one of the great tenets of this country—that is, that people are entitled to a fair go, to be treated

        The effect of such laws has been over time to destroy and remove the chance for people to have a job. The idea of no ticket, no start in Australia, unfortunately, is commonplace. How many times have honourable members, particularly on this side, had a constituent ring up and say, `I'm being heavied by the union because they require us to join up our people in the union?' I must have had loads of those cases. The Transport Workers Union, for example, is well known in this country. You can be a small business operator, turn up on a site driving your own truck and you will be banned from that site as a result of a law put in place by these people at the behest of the trade union movement.

        It goes beyond these matters of compulsory unionism and preference. Take the existing provisions for certified agreements. They are agreements which are struck at the workplace which are then certified by the Industrial Relations Commission. Under the existing system, those certified agreements are between unions and employers. If you are in a union, as an employee in that workplace, you might have some say—although in a lot of unions the union members have absolutely no say. But if you are in a business and you are a non&amp;hyphen;union employee, under the existing law there is no requirement for majority support for an agreement. In other words, if the union does the deal with the boss, you get no formal say. If you are a non&amp;hyphen;union member in particular, you have got no look&amp;hyphen;in whatsoever.

        I think that is basically wrong. It is basically unfair. It is unreasonable that people, simply because they are not in a union, should have their rights taken away from them. That is a situation that cannot last, must not last and I say will not last.

        The undemocratic feature of this development today is that the existing rules in the industrial relations system were put together under the previous Labor government but they were rejected in the election. Now we have the Democrats siding with the party that was rejected to obstruct the proposals for which the incoming government has a mandate, which the people have asked us to introduce. The reason they have asked us to introduce these measures is that they give people a chance for a job, they give people at work a chance to have a say and, ultimately, these proposals respect and uphold one of the great values of our Australian society—that is, the right to be treated fairly and on your merits. The current system is unfair. It discriminates against people. It is time that that was brought to an end.

Is he aware of the fact that the gentlemen he named, plus Robert Cotton and others who became ambassadors, under your regime received their full superannuation payments as a result of their retirement from this parliament, which, given their levels of ministerial service, in today's dollar terms would have been about $70,000 to $80,000, on top of their salary? Is he aware that we altered that practice as a result of our concerns about that type of performance?

I have to say: it is pretty rich for the Labor Party, the party that professes passion for the workers, the downtrodden, the unemployed, the strugglers, the battlers—that is all your rhetoric—and, when it comes to your mates, you pay them more than anyone has ever paid such appointees in the history of this country.

Over recent weeks we have seen simply amazing scenes on the other side of the parliament as they mill about, bumping into each other, trying to decide on what their economic policy will be over the next three years. On the accord, for example, we have heard the shadow minister for industrial relations tell us that the accord has no future and that he is against another accord, while the shadow Treasurer has been prattling on along the old line in that he thinks there might still be another accord. If he would listen to some of his own supporters—even Jennie George herself does not want another accord because she has seen the disastrous effects of the previous accord on the people whom she is supposedly representing.

He started out by saying, `I think that maybe we should deal with the surplus, but not yet, not in 1997-98. Perhaps at some other time in the future we'll deal with it.'

You are not serious in trying to close to this gap.

         <break page="1285" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          of this nation, and when the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), served as a policy adviser to representatives in that government, the Prime Minister left Australia in a state of disarray. In 1983, he left a legacy of a spiralling underlying rate of inflation of 10.5 per cent, and an unemployment rate of 10 per cent. That is why he was known at the time as the double digit Treasurer—double digit John Howard.
         </break>
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        At that time, Australia was basically at industrial war. An industrial war was in place in Australia because of the failure of the Prime Minister, who was then the Treasurer, to put in place a reasonable wages policy and to pursue an approach to life that was based on cooperation and goodwill in the workplace. With that legacy in mind, our responsibility was to try to reshape Australia and to take Australia forward. We had to ensure that, as a nation, we had the ability not only to compete locally but also to compete on an equal footing with other nations in the international arena in the light of increasing globalisation of the world economy.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Our first responsibilities were, for example, to reduce the level of industrial disputation by something in the order of 60 per cent based on the current figures; to lock in a low rate of inflation; and to give workers and their families better opportunities through the development of decent programs, such as through lowering taxes—including, I might say, for the corporate world. People should not forget the level of corporate taxation that existed under the Prime Minister when he was the Treasurer of this great nation. In government, the Labor Party also addressed the question of improvements in child care, access to decent educational opportunities, and public housing. Those issues are all low on the policy agenda of the current government.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I refer to the fact that we pursued superannuation and a decent savings policy and that we sought to increase household disposable income not just by increasing the social wage but also by having a record achievement in job creation. The end result was an increase in disposable income in the order of 40 per cent since 1983, when the member for
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         Goldstein was last a policy adviser whilst he sat at Monash University and Melbourne University for the purpose of ensuring that his very backward looking approach to public policy in Australia was put in place.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is high time that this nation faced up to the fact that we made a good start in the last 13 years to ensure that we put in place and lock in once and for all equal opportunities at work and at home for our young men and women of Australia. We did not have that opportunity when we assumed power in 1983 because not only was Australia an economic mess and there was industrial war in Australia but also the Prime Minister had left Australia with a record deficit. In dollar terms today that deficit was in the order of $24.5 million or 4.9 per cent of GDP.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I understand why members of the government do not like to hear these hard facts: they do not like to be reminded of their failure to perform when they were last in power in Australia. We were not just concerned with those issues. We were concerned about ensuring that Australia's young were given not only educational opportunities irrespective of where they came from and irrespective of the level of income or the nature of the job that their parents had but also decent opportunities to access tertiary education.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We all know the approach of the member for Goldstein prior to the election of the Labor government in 1983. When he started lecturing at Melbourne University, his first lecture in politics was about what a great lecturer he was. He was only interested in lecturing la creme de la creme, not ordinary working&amp;hyphen;class kids who had been given an opportunity as a result of the previous decisions by the Whitlam Labor government to ensure that all of us, irrespective of where we came from, had access to tertiary education. It did not matter whether you lived at Blacktown in Sydney or Footscray in Melbourne, you were guaranteed an opportunity to pursue a tertiary education opportunity.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In addition to that, we are about record job growth. The member for Goldstein likes to forget that, when the current Prime Minister of Australia was last in power, this was his legacy on the employment front—and I know
        <break page="1286" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         it hurts: he had 700,000 dead men and women hanging on his shoulders. No wonder he wandered around the nation stooped. But that was not bad enough. He likes to raise the issue of youth unemployment. What was the level of youth unemployment in 1983? This is John Howard's legacy—158,100 young men and women of Australia were denied employment opportunities and, in association with their denial of employment opportunities under the then Prime Minister, they were denied access to decent wages, conditions of employment and decent opportunities of work.

        I refer to the question of the training wage and I refer specifically to a speech that was tabled in the House this afternoon given by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training yesterday entitled `Training: pathways to real jobs'. I urge all members of the House to read that speech in detail and consider the hidden agenda that is contained in that speech and in the industrial relations bill that is to be introduced into this House today.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A very precise examination of that speech, which has been tabled in this House, takes you back to the coalition's policies of October 1992. Yes, Jobsback. I refer specifically to page 9—I am sure the member for Goldstein is aware of this particular policy document—which says:

       <para>
        I suggest that people do some calculations with respect to the application of the member's speech of yesterday in association with the government's policy of October 1992. This is what it amounts to. Under the provisions flagged by the member for Goldstein yesterday whereby `no young person will be required to take up a training option where their total income would be less than under the income support arrangements', I put it to the House that the real application of that speech is as follows.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Sixteen&amp;hyphen; and 17&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old workers can be paid as little as $3.05 an hour. The Jobsback policy of 1992 is calculated on the basis of a 38&amp;hyphen;hour week—and I assume you don't want
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         to take away the 38&amp;hyphen;hour week in association with reducing the hours of work and wages of young people in Australia. From the youth training allowance rate for dependants without children in the age group, which is $232.10 per fortnight, you come up with an hourly rate of $3.05 an hour. Let us go to the 18&amp;hyphen; to 20&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds. They will get little more than about $3.38 an hour, even worse than the policy of October 1992 of $3.50 an hour. That is also calculated on the basis of a devisor of a 38&amp;hyphen;hour week from the youth training allowance rate for dependants without children in the age group.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Then we go to the new industrial relations regime, the so-called bill. I refer the House to the approving authority. What does it say? I refer specifically to the failure of the Prime Minister to answer this question in the House today and I quote from the proposed bill:

         —Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for pulling me up on that point. I shall observe the courtesy. The member for Batman told us that the former government had put into place policies which provided real and genuine training to young people. Youth full&amp;hyphen;time unemployment today, at 27&amp;half; per cent or thereabouts, is as high as it was when that program was introduced two years ago.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As the member for Hotham knows only too well, what the former government put into place was a set of programs which did not lead young people on to real jobs. These programs that the member for Batman thinks are so wonderful gave the merry-go&amp;hyphen;round a spin and brought 60 per cent of the young people in those programs right back to the end of the unemployment queues again.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The sort of training that has traditionally led to real jobs has involved apprenticeship and traineeship opportunities. Last year, near the very end of the former government's tenure in office, the number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships was, as a proportion of the work force, the lowest for three decades.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The whole apprenticeship system was allowed to atrophy. It did not fit in with the training agenda that you wanted to run. It did not fit in with the training agenda that the ACTU were promoting. The agenda they were
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         promoting forwarded their industrial relations objectives. They were not the slightest bit interested—they never were interested—in putting into place a training system which focused on training for young people and led to real jobs. The ACTU wanted to link the centralised wages system with the training system. They wanted to have a highly bureaucratic set of arrangements. Every time they could stamp somebody as having achieved a competency level, regardless of the value of that person to the small business, they wanted more money; they wanted higher wages.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So young people have been disastrously disadvantaged by the policy of the former government. There are now 26,500 teenagers in Australia who have been unemployed for more than 12 months, and that number has risen in the last year. I am sure nobody is claiming that it has risen because of the policies of the present government; it has risen because of the policies of the previous government. The coalition is about putting in place training opportunities that will give young people a foothold in real jobs—the kinds of training opportunities that the former government and its mates in the ACTU refused to accept.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        They put in place something they called the national training wage award. They did not bother to talk to small business about that award; that award was designed in the smoke-filled rooms of the ACTU. That award put in place proposals and policies which have discouraged small business from taking on trainees, which is why there is such a pathetically low number of trainees in Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There could be many more. There could be many more apprenticeships. There could be new kinds of apprenticeships in new industries alongside the traditional kinds of apprenticeships. There could be many more apprenticeship type opportunities in the service sector, in information technology and in multimedia. There could be opportunities across a whole range of new industries. But of course the work practices in those industries very often do not fit the kinds of arrangements the ACTU is prepared to allow Australian governments to put in place.

Our aim in these new policies is to ensure that a range of flexible new training opportunities are put in place for young people—new kinds of apprenticeships, new kinds of traineeships; not the kinds of labour market training merry&amp;hyphen;go&amp;hyphen;round programs that took most young people back onto the dole, but programs that give them a foot in the door of the workplace, where a real job can be provided. They are the basic principles on which the government's training reforms are based and no amount of scare talk and dishonesty by the opposition is going to make the slightest difference to the government's intention to give young people the opportunities that they have been denied for the last 13 years.

         During his speech, the member for Batman told the House that the labour market programs are currently frozen. Let us leave aside the issue of whether or not the training under those programs is high quality training. It is not the accredited training, according to industry standards, that provides portable qualifications for young people. The member for Batman indicated in another part of his speech that that was the ideal requirement for
         <break page="1290" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         But why is there a constriction at the moment on the availability of funds in this area? It has nothing whatever to do with the decisions of the present government. Last year the previous government allocated to these labour market programs an annual budget of $2.1 billion for the current year. That would seem to most people an enormous amount of money—an enormous amount of money with which an enormous amount of good could be done.

         How was this money used? How was it managed by the former Minister for Employment, Education and Training, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean)? On the Monday after the election, 4 March, no less than $2,000 million of that $2.1 billion—that is, 95 per cent of it—had already been committed. Seventy-one per cent had been spent and another proportion of it had been committed, taking it up to 95 per cent already having been committed. Out of the whole $2.1 billion, only $91 million was left to cover the last third of the year. It would have to be one of the most irresponsible pieces of financial management that this country has seen since Federation.

        It is not about a fair day's pay for a fair day's wage. It has nothing do with it. The employer contracts for a certain price and then he just brings in the juniors. I do not know how that will increase full-time work in this country. I cannot see how it is going to go anywhere near increasing full-time work because employers will engage more part-timers and more juniors to do full-time workers' jobs. We are going to do away with any link between three tradesmen and one apprentice. That will go. There will not be any link between tradesmen and apprentices or tradesmen and training. It will be open slather.

        Under the previous government we went down the path of locking training and wages together so that we could maintain and educate our young people in the work force to become smarter and better skilled and keep our competitive edge in Asia and in Europe. We talk about being a smarter country so that we can go down that track, but we are not going to become the smarter country; we are going to become the duller country, with fewer skills and with no innovation coming from the other side.

         —I rise to join in this debate with some amazement. We have just heard a diatribe from the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) which would take us back to the Great Depression. He talks about everything that was wrong then and how wonderful everything was under a Labor government. He sat in office with the ACTU and did everything possible to prevent young people from getting jobs, from getting real structured training, from learning new trades and from learning to participate in the life of their nation. We have today one of the highest youth unemployment rates this nation has ever seen. It is an absolute disgrace. We know it is a disgrace, and this government is going to try to do something about it.

        We have also just heard from the member for Lyons (Mr Adams). The member for Lyons seems to assume that this government, in attempting to make some changes that would benefit young people, is out to destroy them—we are going to beat up on them and we are going to force them into slave wages. Let me tell the member for Lyons something: people work for fair value. Employers in this nation well know that they are not going to get good productive work, nor are they going to improve their own employment situations, if they do not pay decent wages and offer people decent conditions. We all know that. It is axiomatic.

        Our social safety nets in this country, applied through the social security department, allow people a living wage.

We have a demonstrable problem in that we are losing out of years 9 and 10 a number of students who are leaving school at that very early age—not to enter the job market and/or to go on the dole. We are just losing them. We do not know where they are going, but we know that they are disappearing out of the school system. They are bored because there is no structured work for them to do and there is no training that appeals to them. They are the ones who are going to wind up on the streets as the homeless and, ultimately, are going to wind up in the dole queues; they may be those who wind up on drugs or alcohol and with other problems; and they may wind up in the courts and in the justice system.

        We have to do something for those kids. I am worried to death about them. It really frightens me. Under the Labor government, our school system has moved away from a concept that we once had—that there were two streams, if you like, to education. One of the streams was basically those who wanted a good general education, for whatever purpose, and then went on to CAEs or universities in order to get further education and further training. The other stream did both academic studies and vocational trade training at school. The member for Lyons knows that, but the government of the day did away with it. Some time in the 1970s they said that vocational training was second-class education for second-class kids, and they wiped it. Late in the piece, the last government finally started to catch on—after 13 years of failure—that the skills base was disappearing, that we were losing skilled tradesmen and that we were losing our capacity to attract people into vocational training. So you started to make some changes.

         We need for those kids in years 9 and 10 a program that will offer them a couple of days a week at work in some structured training, including training in life skills—how to get up on time in morning, how to be at the job on time, how to brush your teeth, how to use deodorant, how to present yourself as acceptable to the rest of society, how to stay at work until finish time, how to produce some thing while you are there, as well as how to get on with your work colleagues and do something decent for the company in which you participate—and two days a week in general education at high school. We have tried a pilot program at Berwick High School in my electorate which has become so successful that we desperately need funding for it. They have heaps of kids that they believe are at risk of leaving the school system and being lost out there in the never&amp;hyphen;never, unrecoverable for a long time.

        I will tell you another thing about this group of young people: they generally have very poor literacy and numeracy skills. That will follow them all the rest of their lives. There is a real link between non-attendance at school and lack of literacy. We find links between those who are abusive at school to their fellow students, whether it is violence or whether it is verbal harassment, and poor literacy skills. If you go and talk to the youth organisations, they say that there is a real link between those who are on the streets and need help and those who have poor literacy and numeracy skills. These are young people that needed to have a better go at primary school.

        Despite supposedly being designed to help employees, the system this bill seeks to reform has helped contribute to a long&amp;hyphen;term decline in workers' living standards in Australia, relative to those in many other countries, while contributing to our unacceptably high level of unemployment.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I now turn to consider the impact of our reforms on the award system. At the outset, let me state that the government has maintained its commitment to ensure that all employers and employees with federal award coverage will have the choice of remaining on their awards.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, the role of the commission, the scope of awards, and arrangements for their adjustment, need to be consistent with and reinforce the role of awards as a genuine safety net. This is important for the viability of the wage system—to ensure its capacity to provide safety net protection, to encourage

          agreement&amp;hyphen;making and to meet overall economic objectives.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The commission's role in relation to wages will focus on the setting of minima—it will not generally be able to arbitrate claims above the minimum safety net. The mechanism by which the commission adjusts safety net rates of pay and other award minima will not be prescribed in the legislation. This will be a matter for the commission to determine, through a review of wage principles, within the framework and objects of the legislation and after hearing the submissions of all the parties.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Consistent with the focus of awards on safety net minimum wages and conditions, the commission's jurisdiction, and thus the capacity of the parties, to incorporate matters in awards will be confined to certain allowable matters. The bill provides for a full bench of the commission to establish principles relating to the future handling of these matters, as it has done in the past with its existing award jurisdiction. All matters beyond those specified in the legislation should generally be determined at the enterprise or workplace level, whether in formal agreements or informally.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         However, conciliation will be available with respect to all matters, including agreements. When conciliating, and if requested by the parties, the commission will be required to make a recommendation by consent to resolve differences, provided it is satisfied that the parties will abide by the recommendation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         From the date of commencement of the new act, new awards will not be able to contain matters other than those allowed by the statute. Transitional arrangements will apply whereby parties to existing awards are encouraged and assisted to simplify their awards to focus on the allowable terms and conditions, with other matters addressed by agreement. After 18 months, any disallowed matters remaining in awards will not be enforceable.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Such reforms to awards will deliver critical changes that were acknowledged by the previous government as necessary, but which it failed to put into place because of the

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The commission will also be reviewing awards to ensure that provisions are more flexible and geared to the needs of individual enterprises and workplaces. In particular, restrictions on regular part&amp;hyphen;time work will be removed from the award system. Such part&amp;hyphen;time work, with pro rata entitlements to the conditions available to full&amp;hyphen;time workers, and reasonable predictability in the manner in which hours are worked, will be a boon for many workers who, for reasons such as family responsibilities, are either unable or do not wish to work full&amp;hyphen;time.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         With awards concentrating on safety net minimum standards, new paid rates awards will not have a role in the wage system. Existing paid rates awards will be subject to the award simplification process applying to awards generally and, over time and after consultation, will be treated in the same way as minimum rates awards.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         All current legislative provisions relating to paid rates awards will be repealed and the commission will no longer have the power to make such awards. Current entitlements for the allowable matters under such paid rates awards will be protected, with any changes being subject to the commission's wage principles. It is expected that parties to these awards will make agreements that determine the detailed remuneration and working arrangements to apply, as most have done to date via certified agreements.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Because awards will be simplified, there will be more choice about how work is to be organised at the workplace.

         Under this bill, the options for agreement&amp;hyphen;making will be significantly expanded and simplified. Employers and employees in the federal jurisdiction will be able to choose whether they want informal over&amp;hyphen;award arrangements, or whether they want to formalise their agreements. For those who want formalised individual agreements, we have provided Australian workplace agreements, AWAs. If they prefer formalised collective agreements, they will be able to choose certified agreements, CAs, made with unions or made directly between employers and employees.

          A major innovation in the bill is the establishment of AWAs, allowing agreements to be reached directly between an employer and his or her employee(s).

          AWAs will be formalised simply, by being filed with the Employment Advocate, EA. The EA will be an independent statutory officer whose powers and functions are laid down in the legislation.

          Advice to employees on statutory entitlements and services of the EA will also be required by the legislation, and the EA will provide employers with readily accessible information and pro forma material for this purpose.

          Procedures for filing AWAs will be straightforward. A simple declaration will be made by the employer that the statutory requirements for the AWA have been met—most notably, that the AWA provides terms and conditions which are no less favourable than the statutory minimum conditions.

          The EA will not vet the agreement before it comes into effect, and all agreements will be confidential to the parties, as they should be. There is no conspiracy of secrecy here.

It is the government's intention to maximise the opportunity for commercial negotiation to solve access issues, but the ACCC may take an arbitration role if negotiation is unsuccessful. This approach will apply at the core regulated airports—that is, the major 12 FAC airports.

The leasing of airports represents an important part of the government's transport reform program. The government's Airports Bill 1996 and companion Airports Transitional Bill 1996 will allow the leasing to proceed swiftly and with strong protection of the public interest. The government's airport reforms will provide a significant boost to employment and investment in the Australian economy. I present the explanatory memorandum.

        The sale of long&amp;hyphen;term leases over airports currently operated by the Federal Airports Corporation, FAC, forms an important part of this government's privatisation program. The government is confident that the leasing process for the federal airports offers a number of long&amp;hyphen;term benefits to the Australian people.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The decision to sell long&amp;hyphen;term leases offers benefits to airport users and the community as
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         a whole. The leasing process should lead to further improvements in the operating efficiency and quality of service of the airports by exposing them to private sector disciplines. It will also provide an opportunity for the funds of Australians to be productively employed in the provision of national infrastructure through the involvement of superannuation and investment managers.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The provision of airport infrastructure has traditionally been considered the responsibility of government due to the large amount of capital required. However, today, Australia's capital markets have reached a level of maturity and sophistication capable of supporting the evolving infrastructure requirements of airports. The Commonwealth's involvement in the provision of such infrastructure will no longer be necessary given the protection to public interest considerations afforded by the proposed regulatory regime of the Airports Bill 1996.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The primary purpose of this bill is to put into place a framework to facilitate leasing of all federal airports effectively as ongoing businesses under a two&amp;hyphen;stage sales process. It is proposed that Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth airports will be included in the first phase leasehold sales. Adelaide will also be added to the first tranche consistent with our election commitment, subject to decisions to be taken in the budget. The leasing of Sydney and Sydney West airports will be deferred pending resolution of noise issues at Sydney airport and an environmental impact study being conducted on Sydney West airport. In the meantime, consideration will be given to how best to position Sydney and Sydney West airports for future sale.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The bill provides for the transfer of airport land and other assets from the FAC to the Commonwealth; the granting of leases over the airports and transfer of associated assets to individual airport companies; and the orderly treatment of the FAC's debts during the sales process. Provision has also been made in the bill for the transfer of airport staff employed by the FAC to the airport companies.

         The companion bill, the Airports Bill 1996, will establish the regulatory regime for air ports post leasing. This regulatory regime is designed to improve the efficiency of airport operations while ensuring the protection of airport user and community interests.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Leasing the airports permits the government to retain some control over the land on which the airports are located. The long term of the lease will ensure that sales proceeds are similar to sale under freehold title.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The sale of long&amp;hyphen;term leases is expected to produce a significant net offset to outlays in the forthcoming financial years. Provision has been made in the bill to allow for the orderly disposal of the FAC's assets and facilitate and account for the leasing process. The transactions associated with these provisions are expected to be budget neutral. As honourable members would appreciate, it would not be appropriate for the government to disclose details of expected proceeds from the leasing of the airports, as it is likely this would influence the outcome of the sale process, possibly reducing proceeds.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As I have indicated, a number of measures designed to facilitate the leasing of the federal airports are contained in the bill now before the House. These measures provide for the land and associated assets of the FAC to be transferred to the Commonwealth, as well as provide for the Commonwealth to grant a lease over land at a particular airport to a company referred to as an airport lessee company. Following this, the bill provides the government with a flexible disposal strategy to grant an airport lease to a company either established by the Commonwealth or the purchaser. In both instances when the lease is granted, the FAC's contractual rights, obligations and liabilities are transferred to the airport lessee company.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The bill also provides for airport staff to transfer to the airport lessee companies at the time a lease is granted over the relevant airport. The bill also contains provisions to enable transfer of accrued benefits and leave entitlements post&amp;hyphen;sale. These provisions are designed to ensure fair and consistent treatment of staff.

        To ensure that state and territory governments receive duties to which they are entitled on sale transactions which take place in

         their state or territory, the sale of shares in airport lessee companies or the sale of leases over the airports will be subject to state and territory taxes and stamp duties. The bill does, however, provide for the transfer of the lease or assets that take place while the airport lessee company is owned by the Commonwealth to be exempt from stamp duty. This exemption does not cover the sale by the Commonwealth of its shares in the company, nor the transfer of the lease or assets to a company where that transfer takes place after sale time.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        A number of taxation provisions have been provided for in the bill to ensure that both the purchasers and existing lessees of the FAC are not disadvantaged from a taxation perspective. The government has adopted these provisions in respect of transactions between the FAC, the Commonwealth and the airport lessee company to ensure that the tax effect of the transactions would be the same as if it were a sale by the FAC in the private marketplace.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Provisions have also been made in the bill to deal with the FAC's debt, which comprises both Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth debt. These provisions, along with the existing provisions in the FAC's statute, provide the government flexibility to deal with the FAC's debts in the most appropriate manner. In managing the FAC's debt during the sale process, the government can assure honourable members that the FAC bondholders' interests will be taken into account. The bill also provides for the treatment of the debt during the sale process to be properly recorded in the Commonwealth's accounts.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Following the leasing of the major federal airports, the FAC head office will continue to have a role in overseeing the management of the remaining federal airports prior to their leasing in the second phase of the sale process. These second phase airports present specific regional and administrative issues which will need to be addressed prior to their lease. Among these are the joint user airports at Canberra, Darwin and Townsville, which are jointly operated by the FAC and the Department of Defence. The development of new operating arrangements with Defence will
        <break page="1311" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         be required before the civil facilities at these airports can be leased.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is expected that a number of the second phase airports which have been unprofitable in the past should prove commercially viable under private ownership through cost reductions and improved revenues. The government will examine options to secure the future of the remaining few airports that may prove to be commercially non&amp;hyphen;viable by taking into account the specific financial characteristics of each airport as well as regional interests and concerns.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This bill is intended to provide a framework for the sale of leases over the airports currently operated by the Federal Airports Corporation. This bill and the companion Airports Bill 1996 are designed to promote the most efficient operation and maintenance of Australia's airport infrastructure, while ensuring that the benefits of increased efficiency are passed on to airport users and the community as a whole. The government is confident that these arrangements will ensure a fair return from the airports while allowing it to divest itself of a function in which its involvement is no longer essential. I present the explanatory memorandum.

         The government expects that new entrants to Australia should provide for their own support during their first two years, 104 weeks, in Australia and, as a result, announced as part of its 1996 election policy commitments that the newly arrived resident's waiting period would be so extended. This bill implements that commitment.

         Currently, information about when people start and end their employment may not be sought under sections 1307 or 346. The result is that employers are often faced with having to respond to a request for information under section 1307 or 346 and then having to deal with a follow&amp;hyphen;up request authorised under another section of those acts if, on the basis of the initial advice provided by them, it appears to the Department of Social Security that there has been an overlap in payment of a social security payment or youth training allowance and employment.

         The government wishes to reduce the paperwork burden on business. To that end, it would be more efficient if only one request had to be made to employers. It would also be beneficial from an individual's viewpoint. In many cases, the initial provision of more information about a person would confirm that the person was legitimately entitled to a payment and so there would be no need to undertake a follow&amp;hyphen;up that might, quite unjustifiably, result in employers drawing adverse inferences about a person.

          It would ensure, for example, that income data in respect of the 1994&amp;hyphen;95 financial year could be used so as to review the entitlement of a person to family payment for 1996 even though the person might have already lodged their 1995&amp;hyphen;96 tax return. It would also ensure that income data in respect of the 1994&amp;hyphen;95 and 1995&amp;hyphen;96 financial years could be used in a single matching cycle to enable checking on student and parental personal income details for 1995 and 1996.

         —I wish to raise for the attention of the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), a recent decision of the Australian Broadcasting Authority. In February, the ABA ruled that what is known as
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          The Liars Club
         </emphasis>
         program on Radio Station 3RRR had breached radio program standard 3(b) as well as conditions of the station's licence as set out in the Broadcasting Services Act. The decision was the result of a complaint by the Church of Scientology that comments made by the program presenter in September last year constituted religious vilification.

         The Broadcasting Authority's decision is the first time that a complaint on the basis of religious vilification has succeeded. What should trouble the minister and many Austral ians, however, is that there is precious little justification for the decision.

        The Broadcasting Authority's judgment that
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         The Liars Club
        </emphasis>
        gratuitously vilified the Church of Scientology on its program is disturbing, firstly, because the decision simply cannot be justified on the facts of the case. In defending the decision, the ABA's Nick Herd said that gratuitous vilification carried with it the meaning that comments were unwarranted. The comments were made by a former member of the Church of Scientology which, being based on his own experiences within the church, can scarcely be said to be unwarranted. Secondly, the ABA's decision establishes a precedent which, if not addressed, could effectively shackle broadcasting in this country.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Mr Herd claimed that the critical factor in the ABA's deliberation on the matter was the failure of the presenter to offer a countervailing view to that presented by his guest. This is despite the presenter in question having challenged the claim by the interviewee that Nazism and Scientology had a lot in common.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Are we now to understand that, for example, all radio presenters, when interviewing former members of religious associations who relate unfavourable experiences about those associations—no matter how justified they may be—will be liable to claims of religious vilification? This decision, as it now stands, strengthens the hand of anyone seeking to silence commentary on contentious issues involving religion.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The ABA's decision was a bad decision which confused considered commentary for vilification. If it is not reviewed we will have in Australia a precedent that, rather than complementing this nation's strong tradition of free speech, will in fact restrict it.

         Professed religious convictions should not become a smokescreen for avoiding criticism or public scrutiny. For example, in my electorate there is a man by the name of Neil Thomas. He has his own church which has been called the Grace Church, Neil Thomas Ministries and other names from time to time. He has set up many companies which have gone into liquidation, leaving a trail of creditors. He does not pay his bills and he inveig les people into handing over to him their life savings—in short, he is a crook. He should not be immune from public scrutiny simply because he sets up a church.

        If this decision is not reconsidered, the ABA may well become a clearing house for ongoing and vexatious religious disputation. The Broadcasting Authority was never established for this purpose, and I do not believe that it has the administrative capacity to deal with such matters and sort the wheat from the chaff.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I urge the minister to use his powers under section 171 of the Broadcasting Services Act, which allow him to direct the ABA to investigate matters in the interests of due administration. I further request that the minister use his power under section 161 of the act to advise the ABA of the government's policy on religious vilification which urgently needs clarification as a result of the Broadcasting Authority's decision.

       <para first-indent="16">
        It seems apparent that the judgment and the persecution of this program by scientologists have led to the axing of this program by 3RRR. I am particularly concerned that the Broadcasting Authority refers to `warranted' and `unwarranted' criticism. Who determines what is warranted and what is unwarranted? The Broadcasting Authority's view leaves it in the situation of sitting in judgment on what are valid or invalid religious convictions and conduct. Clearly, the responsibility of the media and broadcasters is to offer both sides a go rather than make the decisions themselves.

        I draw to the attention of the House the historic privatisation of the port of Geelong. This program by the Victorian government means that the port of Portland and the port of Geelong will be in private hands. These very important ports in Victoria will now set a benchmark in the export and import of Australian products. For all other ports around
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         Australia, it will mean there will be a benchmark for costing, for activity and for the way in which a competitive port can operate. The sale price that was achieved by the Victorian government was $50.5 million, and the buyer is a consortium made up broadly of TNT and other investors.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The key element of this change in the operation of the Geelong port is that the channel will remain with another authority. This means that, similar to the national highways and the standard gauge, the channel will remain in public ownership whereas the port itself will be in private hands. We will have a competitive situation where the Geelong port will be competing with Melbourne, Portland and other ports around Australia. As I said, it sets a benchmark for this waterfront problem.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The major imports through the Port of Geelong are: crude oil to the Shell refinery, which represents about 50 per cent of the product that comes through the port; fertiliser raw materials for the Pivot company, with which I had a very good association and which has been a user of the port for many years; and the aluminium that comes into Alcoa at Port Henry, again an important user of the port. The Grains Elevator Board, another important user, exports grain. That board has also been privatised, meaning that the port authority and the privatised grain handling operation will combine very well to provide a first&amp;hyphen;class operation. Also, Midway products uses the port to export its woodchips to various places around the world. Another port activity is the export of Riverina bagged rice, another recent technical development.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Under the former management of the Geelong Harbour Trust and its more recently changed arrangements as a privatised operation under the general management of Peter Morgan, the port has reduced its costs and manpower levels. The Port of Geelong was in a position to be privatised and moved into a more competitive area.

       <para first-indent="16">
        We have had the two major changes of privatisation and industrial relations. I am very confident that the Port of Geelong will lead the way to become one of the best ports on the Australian coastline both for imports and exports and will be a model of competitive efficiency.

         —Mr Speaker, tonight I wish to raise in this adjournment debate what I believe to be the deliberate vandalism of an important labour market program established under the Labor government's Working Nation policy—new work opportunities.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The vandalism to which I refer is the recent decision by the Victorian Workcover authority to bring the landcare and environment action program and the new work opportunities participants within the scope of the 1985 Victorian Accident Compensation Act and to determine that new work opportunities host employers and LEAP sponsor organisations are employers for workers compensation purposes.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This is an appalling and puzzling decision. Because of the training and work experience focus, the longstanding precedent has been that participants in labour market programs are treated as trainees, not employees. It is the case that as trainees they have been fully covered by appropriate accident, injury and public liability insurance.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But the cost of this has not fallen on LEAP sponsors or host employers. I can think of no better way to frighten off potential sponsor organisations and host employers than to saddle them with a potentially large Workcover liability.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         How can the participants in training be regarded as employees? The Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs pays these people a training allowance. The sponsor, broker or host employer has little or no capacity to reject participants referred to it by the department. Sponsors are not required to pay superannuation for participants—or is this next on the list of ways in which to reduce the effectiveness of these programs?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Already this decision has affected the operation of at least one new work opportunity provider operating in the region I represent. The manager of the Northcote Training Centre, Jan Roberts, raised this problem with my office last month and was quoted in the press recently as saying that up to 80 per cent of host employers had been forced to withdraw their offer of work experience for the unemployed as a result of this decision. Who does this hurt? Of course it hurts the long&amp;hyphen;term unemployed.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Under the Working Nation initiatives of the Labor government, the Department of Employment, Education and Training in Melbourne's east strove hard to ensure that the very long&amp;hyphen;term unemployed were the first to be assisted under the new work opportunities program. The hard line on helping those most disadvantaged was difficult to hold but it was held to the credit of the department. We are talking about providing opportunity to people who have been unemployed for many years.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Northcote example that I referred to earlier meant that 45 people were withdrawn from their programs midstream. Some of the sponsor organisations who reluctantly had to withdraw from the program included: Upper Yarra Community House; the Macleod Nursing Home; and the Brotherhood of St Laurence.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is worth stressing that up to the point of this ridiculous decision, the new work opportunities program operated by the Northcote organisation had been highly successful. Some 52 per cent of participants—who have been out of work for between four and 20 years—have been placed in full&amp;hyphen;time jobs through their participation in programs organised by
         <break page="1316" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        <para first-indent="16">
         There has been a great deal of speculation about cuts by this government to labour market programs. The oldest trick in the book is surely to change the program and thereby reduce its effectiveness so that it can later be abolished on the grounds that it is not effective. Is that what is happening here?

        <para first-indent="16">
         Has the federal minister protested to Jeff Kennett against this nonsensical decision to call trainees employees? Does the government endorse the deliberate vandalism of new work opportunities and LEAP by the Victorian government as a prelude to the abolition of these programs?

         On a related matter, I would like to talk about World Vision and foreign aid. I have had an association with World Vision through child sponsorship for about 20 years. Nothing can warm the heart more than sponsoring a child through World Vision, watching that child grow and keeping contact with that child through letters and regular photographs. You feel in a small way that you are contri buting.

        A delegation from the Australian Council of Overseas Aid recently visited me and drew my attention to the fact that Australia's aid budget has been declining in recent years. It used to be around 0.5 per cent as a percentage of GNP in 1982-84, and at present it is hovering at about 0.35 per cent. All honourable members should think seriously about this question of foreign aid. There are really desperate situations out there in Third and Fourth World countries, and we must never forget that we are all part of the global community. We might say at times that we have problems, but think of a pregnant woman who is working right up to the moment of delivering a child. She is working in back-breaking work for something like $2 or $3 a day, and the child is born virtually in the midst of her labour.

        We talk about the benefits of the wonderful health system that we have here. Yet when that child is born the mother uses a piece of grass to tie the umbilical cord. In that grass frequently there are tetanus spores.

We must ensure that moneys are channelled through the aid agencies.

        Aid agencies, particularly aid agencies like World Vision, are closer to the ground. There is less chance of money dissipating and more chance that projects can be developed at a village level. It is of the essence to ensure that individual projects in these villages in the Third World are enhanced by the identifiable means which World Vision and other agencies have of picking particular projects, channelling the funds and raising the standard of living, even if this means just getting a well sunk or providing a pump, agriculture and seed. Developed at a village level, this is the way we can really help. We must all the time address ourselves to this need to maintain in real terms our foreign aid budget.

The review also found non-monetary quantifiable benefits such as the establishment of credibility in international markets, improved trading opportunities with recipient countries, increased investment and a higher degree of export orientation in Australian firms. Similarly, the export market development grants scheme, which the government appears to be allowing to bleed to death by the continuing cuts of speculation about its future, has been demonstrated to be a successful program.

        I rise this evening to indicate to the House that we have an international tragedy within the Commonwealth of Nations. I am sure many members on both sides of the House share the concerns I have with the sovereign state of Sri Lanka. In fact, that country, over the last 10 or 15 years, has been subjected to a horrendous civil war involving the Sinhalese majority, the Tamil minority and a smaller minority group of Muslims. People are being killed and very large injustices are being imposed on that community. I think it is incumbent on Australians, bearing in mind that we have a very large Sri Lankan community in Australia, to take more than a casual interest in the needs of that sovereign state.

        As the New England Highway goes through my electorate, I would like to hear a clear and unequivocal commitment from the Minister for Transport and Regional Development to the ongoing retention of the New England (Mr Sharp) Highway as part of the national highway system. In addition, I would like a commitment from the minister on the funding of the so&amp;hyphen;called Kurri&amp;hyphen;Kurri Corridor, which will provide an important link between the end of the F3 freeway and the beginning of the Upper Hunter area. I would also like a funding commitment on the tidying up of the mess which exists in the Blackhill, Beresfield, Thornton, Tarro and Woodberry areas as a result of the sudden ending of the F3 freeway in that area and the spill&amp;hyphen;off effect we get through those areas. This latter issue goes to public safety and also goes to the amenity of the residents living in that area.

        Not only would the Kurri Corridor provide an important economic transport link between the Upper Hunter area and Sydney and all of its markets but also it would give Cessnock residents their first great hope of a bypass of the town. Cessnock is a beautiful town full of wonderful people, but it does have its problems. Chief amongst them are the thousands and thousands of heavy vehicles that boom through both its streets and its CBD day and night. Its other problem, which it shares with so many country towns, is the decline in its central business district.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The council at Cessnock, of which I was a member for some eight years, would like to address the problem. They would like to beautify the CBD and make it a more friendly and comfortable environment in which to shop. They want the residents to stay in the town and do their shopping rather than seek a more comfortable form of shopping in the large supermarket and retail complexes which exist in the Newcastle and Lake Macquarie areas.

       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The council is stifled in its endeavours because of this issue of heavy vehicles. It is difficult to attract funding for a bypass of Cessnock because Cessnock is not situated on the national highway. So the Kurri Corridor gives us real hope. The design of the corridor has been funded and it is in place. All we need now is a commitment from this government on the retention of the New England Highway as the national highway and the funding of the Kurri Corridor.

         If this is not a possibility in the longer term, we have one other opportunity. During the last federal election campaign, the then shadow minister for transport, now the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, indicated to the Australian people that a new form of road funding might come into being. It was called `Funding for roads of national importance'. The bypass of Cessnock is an issue of very great importance. I suggest that the minister, at the very least, revisit his election commitment and investigate the funding of a bypass of Cessnock under that funding program he indicated he would commit himself to.

In fact, with this issue, all we have seen over the last 13 years—and, in particular, the last four or five years—has been a complete effort to hide the figures and to ensure that the public were misinformed about the real situation.

        In setting up the national review of education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in 1993, the former government was recognising the fact, stated in the 1994&amp;hyphen;95 report
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Social justice for indigenous Australians
        </emphasis>
        , that Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islander people were `the poorest, sickest, most unemployed and least educated of all Australians'.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The review was established to examine the operation of the first triennium of the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy, AEP. The AEP began in 1990 as a national effort between the Commonwealth, the states and territories and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to strategically address the educational needs of indigenous Australians. The AEP identified 21 goals under four main themes: involvement, access, participation and outcomes; particularly recognising the fundamental importance of the involvement of indigenous people at all stages of decision making.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The original joint policy statement of the AEP in 1989 acknowledged the power of education to improve the quality of life for people from financially impoverished backgrounds. The joint policy statement says:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Numerous reviews, inquiries and consultations conducted in recent years have all demonstrated that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people place a high priority on education. They want for themselves and their children no less by way of educational opportunity than is afforded other Australians. They expect that educational processes should leave them to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to realise their individual potential, lead satisfying lives and contribute actively to the community. They look to education as a means of moving out of poverty and welfare dependency, enabling them to earn income through employment or enterprise and to manage the development of their communities.
       </para>
       <para>
        Five years after the AEP was established was a suitable time to consider the extent to which it had met expectations in terms of the 21 goals. The review praised the AEP for delivering more funding stability in the form of triennial rather than annual arrangements, for fostering cooperation between federal, territory and state governments and between education sectors, and for identifying the need for more culturally appropriate curricula.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Not surprisingly, it also found that the AEP's first three years held some lessons for its future operation. In terms of educational participation and attainment, the review found that improvements, although evident, were inconsistent across sectors and systems. It found that many parents now have an avenue for becoming directly involved in their children's schooling through the establishment of over 2,500 parent committees under the Aboriginal student
        <break page="1323" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         support and parent awareness program, ASSPA. It also found that the cooperative national approach of the AEP had encouraged the development of Aboriginal studies and Torres Strait Islander studies as part of the curriculum in an increasing number of educational institutions.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        These kinds of improvements were not seen uniformly across the country, however, and addressed to only a limited extent the extreme educational disadvantage facing our indigenous population. The review made 44 recommendations designed to improve Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's experience of education. Sixteen of the recommendations apply specifically to the Commonwealth, while others involve the state and territory governments and non&amp;hyphen;government education authorities.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The former government responded to the review in September last year, announcing a package of measures which included those incorporated in this bill. The response announced the Labor government's intention to make the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program recurrent, and this measure is a key part of the bill we are considering today.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It will provide greater stability of funding, as well as ensuring that funds remain commensurate with enrolments. It will also simplify funding arrangements, addressing complaints made to the review about the time spent preparing submissions. In line with review recommendation 37, the proposal is to provide funds on a per capita basis and in a way which reflects the differing costs of educational provision across sectors, and in remote and non&amp;hyphen;remote areas.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I note that the government intends these changes to accompany a more accountable outcomes&amp;hyphen;focused process for the distribution of Commonwealth funds. There is no doubt that we need to continue down the path set by the previous government in placing a high priority on establishing comprehensive and up&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;date databases across all sectors of education and training so that the performance of the AEP in meeting its objectives can be properly evaluated. The previous government also obtained agreement from most states to increase their effort in Aboriginal education expenditure in order to access a pool of Commonwealth money in the form of strategic results projects.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The opposition will be most interested in arrangements made with the states as a result of this bill. We would expect the government to ensure that commitments made by the states to increase effort are not permitted to lapse due to any reduction in commitment by the Commonwealth or any diminution of resolve on the part of the Commonwealth. There is far too much at stake.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In closing, I would like to congratulate the chair of the reference group overseeing the review, Mandawuy Yunupingu; the deputy chair, Romina Fujii; and the other members of the reference group on the excellent job they did. I would also like to say that real improvements can be made in indigenous education if all governments work together with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. We have come some of the way; this bill takes us further toward our goal.

        When people talk about the key to addressing that disadvantage, they sometimes talk about health; they sometimes talk about housing, education, employment, the importance of land, the justice system, and so on. It seems to me that those things are all important. It is not just one of those items being the key; they all play an important part and it seems to me that it should be an interactive process. You have to improve housing and health in parallel with education and gradually develop that total environment.

        You do not get a good education if your health is not up to scratch.

But you have also got an education problem because you cannot hear what the heck is going on. So we need to look at education in the Aboriginal field in a broad sense.

        We also need to look at overcrowded housing. I have seen overcrowded indigenous housing all around this country. I remember particularly going to Maningrida, which is well known for its arts and crafts, where the average number of people per house in that community is about 38. If you are going to school during the day and you want to advance yourself and do some study or whatever, going home to 38 people in a three&amp;hyphen;bedroom house with one toilet and a shower, in a warm climate, is not exactly conducive to becoming a diligent student, even if you want to.

        The aspect of culture is interesting. Again I would be interested in the comments, perhaps later on, from the honourable gentleman from the Northern Territory. I remember going to Yirrkala which is often held up as a model school in terms of indigenous involvement in running its own education process. It is a school at which Mandawuy Yunupingu, to whom the previous speaker referred, was a teacher some years ago before he moved on to greater fame in other fields. There was great pride, and appropriately so in many senses, that the teaching was conducted in the local language. That was culturally appropriate and was acceptable to the community, but if you went down the road and talked to the major employer in the area, which was Nabalco, the management there said, `One of the problems we have with trying to offer jobs to Aboriginal people is that, although they go to school and they go through the school system, because they often do not have a basic command of English to the standard we need we actually cannot employ them.' So you have this dichotomy of culture and education, and you have to get that mix right.

        Similarly, in the home environment the problem is not just the crowding. If there is substance abuse at home and there is violence or other problems of that sort, clearly you are not going to sit down and do your homework and have the right environment in which to study. Those sorts of problems, coupled with peer pressure and so on, I think are often worse for our indigenous community than for people almost anywhere else in the country.

This bill is about moving primarily, in one sense, to a per capita system. It is about looking for who can best provide education. I think that is important. Often the providers may not be from the conventional sources. I think that is a more relevant factor in indigenous areas than perhaps in many other parts of the community.

        It is particularly about looking for outcomes and not just inputs. I have been critical of many of the things the previous government did in this and other areas but I never basically questioned its good intentions. One of the things that struck me in the life of the previous government and that caused me concern was that we did not get the improved results. I think there was too much focus on providing the inputs and not enough on saying, `Has it been effective and have we got the right results?' So I think that looking at outcomes is fundamental.

        I am not sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, whether you were on this particular visit, but I have graphic memories of one visit we paid to a school which I think was in Mission Beach in Queensland where outstanding Aboriginal teachers really were teachers' aides, if you like, and had nowhere to go. There was no advancement and the level of pay was derisory. Anybody who had real ability in the Aboriginal teaching field was often lost to the field because they went to other jobs where they could get better advancement. It seems to me that there are special needs in terms of improving the lot of indigenous teachers. Of course, it is important to make education culturally appropriate, and we need—above all, perhaps—to take a practical and not a doctrinaire approach.

Reconciliation is something to which the Prime Minister has reaffirmed his commitment on a number of occasions since 2 March. In that context, let me say that next week we are going to celebrate National Reconciliation Week in this building. There will be a major function on Monday at lunchtime, co&amp;hyphen;hosted by the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and the Leader of the Democrats (Senator Kernot), and there will be a special motion moved in the House at the start of business on Monday.

        The reason I mention that is that you do not and will not achieve reconciliation until you have addressed many of the problems that are almost endemic in the disadvantage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. Improving that disadvantage, it seems to me, is one of the issues at the core and that is why bills such as this are so important. I would just remind members of the House that in the second reading speech the minister said that this bill was all about funding levels that reflect an increase of $7.85 million on the existing appropriation.

It is talking about cultural appropriateness and a more cost&amp;hyphen;effective, transparent and manageable system, and it would do this in two basic ways: on the basis of either per capita entitlement or strategic results projects. It is all about value for money and about getting results. As I have said before, I have never doubted that the previous government wanted to try hard in this area, but I have concerns that they did not achieve outcomes, and that is why it is important that we develop a new way of going about some of these things.

         In doing that, we must of course remember that we need to involve Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander parents in their children's education process.

         The appropriate professional development of staff at all levels involved in indigenous education is important, and I have mentioned the cultural sensitivity of curricula as also being important. Probably more than anything else, we have to make sure that in all the things we plan and do; in all the changes we look at and the things we implement, we have indigenous involvement in how we develop the programs, in the measures that we take and in the mechanics of the system. History has taught us that we cannot impose those things from the outside.

         This legislation seeks to achieve for indigenous Australians literacy and numeracy outcomes that are similar to those of non&amp;hyphen;indigenous Australians. It also seeks to make sure that we regularly review progress so that we can try to achieve the objective, or get very close to it, by 2000. I do not think we are going to bring everybody up to scratch in the next four years, but we have to make significant progress. Everybody in our community, whether an indigenous or non&amp;hyphen;indigenous person, is very frustrated with the fact that all the effort and all the talk that has gone on for some years has not produced the outcome.

          It is not a cure by itself, but it certainly helps. The thing that we must do, as a nation and as a parliament—the lead has to come from the parliament—is to put aside party political differences in these sorts of areas. Those of us who have worked in indigenous affairs over the last few years have tried to put aside a lot of those party political differences because, as a nation, we have a responsibility not to fail our citizens. In so many areas, including Aboriginal education, we have failed them in the past and it is important that we now address these problems. This bill will go some considerable way towards doing that, and I therefore commend the bill to honourable members.

        Poor retention rates, particularly at higher levels of secondary schooling, are a major factor in the educational disadvantage of indigenous Australians. For example, at year 12 level the retention rate is 33 per cent compared with 76 per cent for other Australians. Current funding arrangements under the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program, AESIP, are based on submissions which failed to provide certainty and continuity. Funding levels are not currently linked to outcomes and do not reflect levels of enrolment of indigenous students.

          Section 10 of this bill is also very important because it acknowledges the higher costs of education delivery in remote areas, although the definition of `remote' fails to differentiate between vastly different degrees of remoteness. I advise the honourable minister that, in terms of remote, for a primary school student the government rate is some $600 and the non&amp;hyphen;government rate is $2,000. In terms of remoteness, the definition is that, as I understand it, if you are more than 300 kilometres from a population base of 50,000 people you come into the remote category.

With the services that are being provided by the education department of the Northern Territory, a schoolteacher at that level in a remote area would probably be on about $45,000 to $50,000 a year with overtime.

The provision of a 33 per cent cut in the level of funding available to the government school sector is probably the most damaging event to occur in the history of Northern Territory Aboriginal education. This cut will directly impact on the attainment of educational outcomes at a time when more, rather than less, funding should have been devoted to this area.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Accepting the fact that the former government left the new coalition government in a financial mess, I would hope that the minister responsible for this bill will recognise the important fact that not only is the Territory disadvantaged, but other states with large rural and isolated areas are also in need of special funding consideration. As this legislation is most important to the future for those persons in the indigenous education sector, I commend it to honourable members.

         —This is the first time I have spoken in the Main Committee and I am looking forward to it. I am also looking forward to speaking on the Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1996 which will certainly have a very pleasing outcome for the electorate of Herbert. I want to support the bill because

          every Australian has a right to expect fair and equitable access to education, but for many years indigenous Australians have, in the main, been unable to live out this right. This, unfortunately, is not unusual.

        Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people lag well behind non&amp;hyphen;indigenous Australians in just about every social aspect of life. Health, life expectancy, employment and the representation in our gaols are just a few of the areas where indigenous Australians continue to lag well below the acceptable so&amp;hyphen;called `average' standard of living.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In education, the same can unfortunately also be said to be true. Someone once said that knowledge is power. It has been oft quoted, but I do not necessarily subscribe to this point of view. I prefer to believe that knowledge is empowerment. The difference is fundamental and the amendments presented in this bill further the quest for empowerment.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The aim of this bill—to facilitate increased participation and improved education outcomes for indigenous Australians—is a positive action indeed. We can only increase participation rates for indigenous people if we improve access to educational facilities. It is important to do this from the ground up and to start at preschool and primary school.

        Immediately before coming here this week I officially opened the new Good Shepherd community school in Townsville. It was my first school opening and a very proud moment for me. Part of my speech called on the education department to facilitate more culturally relevant learning environments for our kids; environments which take into consideration the needs and requirements of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and their parents.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Townsville has one of the largest per capita metro-indigenous populations in Australia. It is great to see indigenous and non&amp;hyphen;indigenous children mixing so freely. That is the great thing about children. They do not carry the prejudice and racism that older people seem to carry. Getting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people involved in the educational and teaching side is an important element not only for the provision of better, more culturally relevant education programs for indigenous Australians but also for all Australians. This then needs to be carried through to secondary and tertiary levels of education.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the end, I think one of the most important educational outcomes we all hope for for our children is, of course, employment. When I was young—and I am not saying that I am not young now—an arts degree was a pretty big deal and the sign of a very well&amp;hyphen;educated person. Today an arts degree will not get a young person terribly far. Ordinary degrees are becoming double degrees with honours. I dread to think, for my own children's sake, how competitive the job market will be when they graduate from their university studies in a few years time.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Not many things in politics today seem to attract bipartisan support. I think it would be a very brave member indeed who would stand up and oppose the sensible amendments proposed in this bill. I am particularly supportive of the new section 7A which defines the object of the act, which is `to develop culturally appropriate education services for Indigenous people.'

       <para first-indent="16">
        To expand on the importance of this, I want to take you to a great indigenous school in my electorate. About 40 kilometres north&amp;hyphen;east of Townsville is Palm Island. Sister Geraldine Kearney runs St Michael's Primary School on the island. I have had the honour of meeting and being with Sister Geraldine; she has been at the cutting edge of indigenous education on Palm Island for some five years now. I was speaking to her just yesterday and she was telling me quite frankly that Palm Island, sadly, has averaged one suicide a week over the last two months. She sat with the families and attended the funerals. The most worrying part of it is that the people committing suicide are aged between 17 and 25. Some of those people have
        <break page="1332" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         children of their own. Of the 4,500 people who live on Palm Island, 50 per cent are under the age of 25.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In Palm Island's case, when we talk about education outcomes we are talking well beyond primary, secondary and tertiary education. We are talking about life and death. I asked Sister Geraldine how important education is to the future of the people on Palm Island. `Vital' was the simple answer she gave. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) said in the second reading of this bill that the need for quality was clear. Dr Kemp said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . social justice concerns require education to provide a basic foundation of opportunity for all people.
       </para>

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Before I spoke to Sister Geraldine yesterday, she had no idea about the aims or the details of this bill. Yet, when I started to ask her about what areas of indigenous education she thought were of greatest importance, she instantly identified several of the key strategies identified by the honourable minister in his reading of the bill. `Get the kids while they're young,' she said, `and, with the direct assistance of parents and the island elders, provide them with a culturally appropriate education and a continuous overdose of self&amp;hyphen;esteem. In the long run, it will save lives.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Literacy and numeracy are one thing, but we cannot afford to ignore other areas of indigenous education. The development of culturally sensitive curricula on Palm Island has extended to lessons on the environment, the identifying of bush food sources, and the telling of the history and cultural traits of the Palm Island community. Importantly, it has also started to involve education in areas of nutrition. Bad nutrition habits are one of the major sources of the continued health problems suffered by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If we can start educating people in good nutritional habits at an early stage, then we can greatly avoid many of the health problems we see now in the indigenous population. If we can prevent certain health problems from ever arising, then we will not have to continue pouring money into funding their treatment. A proper diet can prevent many health problems, including diabetes, digestive problems, renal problems, high blood pressure and heart disease. When we talk about education outcomes in relation to this bill, it is not unreasonable to look into such positive areas as this. The problems on Palm Island are many, but education is an area where a real difference can be made.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Get the parents involved. They want to be involved. When parents on Palm Island were given the opportunity to contribute to their children's education and have a say in the planning and development of the school's education program, they eagerly took it up. If we want to find out how to develop culturally sensitive educational environments, then we have to involve the parents. In the five years that Sister Geraldine has been at Palm Island, she has seen a marked increase in parental involvement in education, and that is wonderful.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Parents have been involved in education surveys to establish what things they think should be included in the school's curriculum, and they have also been closely involved in the planning and development of a new school building extension. This has had a positive effect on the Palm Island children at St Michael's. They can see their parents taking an active interest in their wellbeing. It has also had a positive effect on the parents in that they feel they are contributing to something very important, and they are.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Get indigenous elders involved. That was something else Sister Geraldine continued to stress, because the elders know the history, culture and heritage of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people better than anyone else. Elders are also the highly respected members of the
        <break page="1333" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         community. Just before Anzac Day, there was an article in the Townsville press advocating veterans going to schools to talk to kids about their experiences of war—what life was like, the sights, the smells, the sounds, the home front and so on. If we are going to do that, then let us also get indigenous elders involved with indigenous education. That is what this bill is about.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Already, justice programs are being applied on Palm Island and trialled elsewhere in Queensland. Aboriginal elders sit down with juvenile offenders and try to instil in them a sense of responsibility and self&amp;hyphen;respect. On Palm Island such programs are increasingly having positive effects. Give elders the support they need to get involved with education. In Palm Island's case, that support is urgently needed. About 50 per cent of the population of Palm Island is under 25 years of age, as I have already outlined. If Palm Island's elders are not given the necessary support, in a few years their generation will not be around anymore, and that will have a serious consequence for that community.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Push to get indigenous people directly involved in education training. That was another point stressed by Dr Kemp and identified by Sister Geraldine. All teachers' aides and ancillary staff at St Michael's are indigenous people. They are the ones who are really teaching the children there. They are the ones who are the full&amp;hyphen;time role models for the children during the day.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the second reading speech of the bill, Dr Kemp identified the importance of the transition from education to the work force. But there are also other important transition points that cannot be ignored. We need to explore the possibility of introducing a preparatory year for all students, particularly those in remote centres, who are making the transition from primary to secondary school. In the great majority of cases in distant rural and remote parts of Australia, secondary education means travel to major regional centres. This involves separation from family and friends, boarding school and, in effect, an entire new way of life.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This is definitely the case on Palm Island. In 1995, all students from Palm Island entering secondary schools had to be placed in mainland boarding schools. Four have already dropped out. They dropped out, not because they did not want to go to school, but because they were not able to handle the dramatic adjustment in lifestyle. In some cases, children in remote centres are just not ready for mainland high schools and the change in the structure of education that they come across. Primary school indigenous students have three times the literacy and numeracy problems of other students. Twenty&amp;hyphen;five per cent of indigenous students do not complete year 10. These figures can be improved by providing culturally sensitive educational environments. I believe they can be improved by easing children of all backgrounds into high school and introducing them to that environment only when they are ready.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have preschool to introduce kids to the idea of going to school and, in certain countries, preparatory years before entering university. For many children in remote Australian communities, both indigenous and non&amp;hyphen;indigenous, a preparatory year could prove vital in making the transition to a different way of life.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Having inherited the economic legacy of the ALP, the need for strict application and distribution of Commonwealth funds is more important than ever. The Australian public, both indigenous and non&amp;hyphen;indigenous, not unreasonably expect value from their taxes. A more accountable process for the distribution of funds will help to ensure that money goes to those areas where it is most needed. Greater accountability requires better planning of how funds will be spent. It also requires better consultation between politicians, the department, the
        <break page="1334" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        That is what this amendment bill is, in part, well and truly addressing. These amendments will, through the restructuring of the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program, contribute to ensuring that such improvements are achieved in indigenous education. I am particularly proud that this bill is outcomes oriented. For the sake of my electorate and the sake of indigenous people in the whole of this nation, I certainly commend this bill to the House.

        During the life of this government, it is imperative that we address some of the concerns and issues confronting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. The land rights issue continues to dominate the indigenous politics debate—but it is not the whole story. If indigenous people are to enjoy their full and rightful share of this nation's blessings, we must ensure improvements in at least two other fundamental areas. Of these, health is perhaps the most publicised concern; but it is certainly not my intention to broach that issue today. The other is education.

        This parliament is not the first to recognise the need for action in this all&amp;hyphen;important area. Indeed, the act we seek to amend was first passed in 1989. In the seven years since it was introduced, the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy has been a qualified success. For the most part, it has received bipartisan backing and has been overseen jointly by the Commonwealth, states and territories. It has produced considerable improvements in both education and training participation for indigenous people. However, there is still a long way to go. The national review of education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples shows the need for new approaches and increased joint efforts if we are to see our indigenous people achieve educational parity with non&amp;hyphen;indigenes over the next four years—which, incidentally, was the goal set by the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs in December 1995.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As with every goal set, there is a preferred route to travel. In this case, the determined course is a series of national priorities for the three years of the Aboriginal education policy, beginning in 1997. There has been agreement amongst indigenous people, the Commonwealth, state and territory governments and education providers that these priorities are critical to the achievement of their goal. The priorities are wide ranging and include the development of career structures for indigenous education workers and a rise in levels of parental involvement in their children's education.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Having received a very good education myself, I recognise these two components as all important. It is very difficult for educational authorities to plan and to provide the best when there is a cloud hanging over their future. Like almost all Australians, they want and need security when making plans for the future, and it is gratifying to see that this need has been recognised. This bill guarantees funding through to the turn of the century, and that will be welcome news for the education providers.
       </para>
       <break page="1335" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         I welcome, too, the move to involve parents in the education process. Teachers can only do so much, and a real love of learning can be instilled by a child's parents, who can encourage creativity in their children long after the formal lessons are over. Parents are very often responsible for instilling a love of learning in their children at a very early age—at the very least, the greater their interest, the greater the child's.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another of the defined priorities is the need for indigenous children to attend preschool education programs. The national experience has shown that children who attend kindergarten or other preschool programs have a significant head start on those who do not.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The forced separation of Aboriginal families over the years has led to a decline in the use of their own languages. I am very happy to see that the program will offer encouragement for students to study indigenous languages, which are very much part of their heritage and their culture.

         We have had hundreds of government programs in these past 20 years attempting to fix one situation or another. Some programs have been a downright failure, particularly those where governments have simply thrown money at a problem. This we will not do. However, it is a necessary element of an election promise that this is funded fully. This government plans to do just that. Over the next four years, we will be more than doubling expenditure on this program. In all, nearly $180 million has been earmarked for supplementary assistance to the education of indigenous Australians.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         With this increase in assistance will come increased accountability. The funding structure of the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program will change. From January next year, AESIP resources will be distributed to eligible providers on a per capita basis. This is not to say that providers will be worse off than they are today. For the first year, at least, funding minimums will be set at the current rate. But per capita spending is, in the longer term, an inducement to increase participation rates.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Under the new arrangements, each eligible provider will negotiate an indigenous education agreement that identifies specific targets to improve performance in one or more areas deemed a priority. Current performance levels will be the point from which potential improvements are targeted and measured. The per capita funding should enable providers—whether they be Commonwealth, state, territory or otherwise—to address the high costs of education in remote areas and the many disadvantages experienced by indigenous students.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         With these agreements signed, the Commonwealth will be interested in participation rates and, obviously, results. The methods will be of the providers' choosing and, given the diversity of situations, I am sure that providers will go about their tasks in different ways. The annual performance reviews will judge if they have been successful in achieving their defined targets.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In addition to the per capita spending, this bill also provides for the strategic results projects. These funds, which represent only a fraction of the total expenditures, will be allocated toward researching and implementing measures that will improve results across the education sector. Universities will be eligible to participate in these projects.

         This bill will improve the chances of indigenous people participating in and receiving a better education. An education has always been vital, never more so than it is today. Many of life's options are decided for us by the standard of education we are offered and whether we take up that offer. I believe this bill offers both opportunity and encouragement. I commend it to the House.

        I take the point of the member for Aston (Mr Nugent) that Aboriginal education depends on many things apart from simply educational funding.

        One of the glories of our nation is the tremendous efforts that have been made over the last 20 or 30 years to bring our Aboriginal people into full communion with the rest of our society. A sign of success, amidst all the gloom and doom we so often hear on this general subject, is that Aboriginal retention rates, while not good enough, while nowhere near retention rates for the wider community, are now at least at levels which would have been regarded as quite acceptable for the wider community just 15 years ago. It is sad that Aboriginal year 12 retention rates are only 30 per cent, but let us remember that this is where they all were just 15 years ago.

        I take also the point of the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Dondas) about the importance of education in English. I recall a story that was once told by our friend and colleague the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) of a visit to a remote Aboriginal out&amp;hyphen;station by the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand. The minister came to the out&amp;hyphen;station and he sat down and made a lengthy speech—in English, of course—explaining to the elders how important it was that their kids were educated in their Aboriginal languages. At the end of the minister's long speech, the elders stood up and said, `Minister, are you aware of the Pitjantjatjara word for helicopter?' The minister said, `Well, I'm sorry, I'm not.' They said, `The Pitjantjatjara word for helicopter is helicopter, and, if you don't educate our kids in English, how on earth are our kids ever going to get on, and how on earth are they ever going to compete in the wider society?' So I very much take the member for the Northern Territory's point; it was well made.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The member for the Northern Territory also referred to what he says is a $3 million drop in funding that the territory will suffer under this bill.

I am very confident that the territory government will have a strong ally in the member for the Northern Territory in negotiating the best possible deal for the territory.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I also take the point that the member for the Northern Territory made that education in remote areas is vastly more expensive than education in urban centres such as Katherine, Alice Springs and Darwin. But I want to point out to the member that there are additional programs that will at least go part of the way to accommodating the problems that he so rightly refers to.

        This bill is establishing the principle of per capita funding in Aboriginal education. Essentially, per capita funding means that if you have the students you get the money. In other words, this is the best possible way to ensure that educational institutions are doing the right thing by their clients. Until now, funding has depended upon an annual negotiation. The trouble with annual negotiations is that you are never quite sure exactly how much money you
        <break page="1337" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         are going to get from one year to the next, and you are never quite sure whether—this year, next year or the year after—your mates or someone else's mates are going to find themselves in positions of authority on the distributing panel. By moving to per capita funding we are establishing more transparency in the funding of Aboriginal education, and that is something which I think everyone in this House would applaud.

        As my friend and colleague the member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) pointed out, this bill also provides for performance reviews so that the providers of Aboriginal education should be subject to the same kinds of standards and performance testing which we expect of everyone else. The thing which always impresses me, Madam Deputy Speaker, whenever Aboriginal issues are debated in this parliament, is the care and the compassion which every member of the parliament brings to the subject. On this subject I want to say how delighted I am that Senator John Herron is the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs.

        We have struggled to come to grips with this issue—we have struggled for 208 years to come to grips with this issue—but we are getting there. When we do manage to bring about complete reconciliation, or reconciliation as complete as is humanly possible, between black and white Australians, it will be to the great glory of our nation and it will be one of the greatest days, if not the greatest day, in Australia's history.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The way to do that is to remember that the things that unite us are always more important than the things that divide us. We white Australians have a lot more in common with black Australians than the newspapers would sometimes give credit for. Aboriginals' cultural memory extends back 40,000 years—and which of us white Australians can say that? They have had the stewardship of our nation for all but the last 200 years, and they will always have great honour for that. But the important thing to recall is that the average black Australian, like the average white Australian, wants to get ahead, wants a better deal for himself or herself, and in particular wants a better deal for his or her children. As my friend Charlie Perkins memorably said, `We have got to get off our black butts, too'. That is something that is well remembered whenever we are discussing this subject.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I would like to conclude by pointing to something which I think is a very welcome development. A lot of my friends and colleagues have been most disconcerted by some of the things that have happened with ATSIC recently and some of the controversy surrounding the Hindmarsh Island Bridge. They have worried that these controversies have brought Aboriginal Australians into disrepute. That is one way of looking at it—and certainly there have been some bad headlines over the last 12 months. But another way of looking at it is that there is now a new pluralism in Aboriginal politics. We now have Aboriginal people, on both sides of Aboriginal issues, standing up and speaking for themselves. It was not, as it happened, white fellows who raised some of the problems with the Hindmarsh Island Bridge; it was the
        <break page="1338" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         dissident Ngarrindjeri women. It was not, in fact, white fellows who raised some of the problems with ATSIC; it was people like Sharon Firebrace, Peter Yu and others, who were standing up and saying, `We, the Aboriginal people, have got to be judged by the same standards of fairness and honesty by which everyone else is judged, and we have got to abide by the same standards of fairness and honesty which we expect to be delivered to us.'
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I think what has become apparent over the last 12 months or so is that some of the people whom we are accustomed to go to as spokesmen or spokeswomen for the Aboriginal people no more represent Aboriginal people than, say, the Liberal Party or the Labor Party represents the Australian people. Often we do speak for the whole of the Australian people, but more often we do not. Occasionally there is a transcendent moment when the representative of one party or one party can speak for the whole of the people. But mostly it does not happen, and one party is simply speaking for a faction, or indeed a fraction, of the Australian people. And so it is now with Aboriginal affairs as well.

        In conclusion, I want to indicate the government's strong intention to continue speaking to everyone in this debate—not just the people who agree with us, not just the people who disagree with us, but everyone. That is the only way that we are going to do justice to all Australians.

        The purpose of this bill is to amend the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1989 to ensure that Australia can discharge its obligations under international instruments relating to the control of transboundary movements of hazardous waste.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The principal act was passed at the time that the Basel convention was negotiated and in the chamber of December 1989. By coincidence, I actually took the bill through the House on that occasion on behalf of the then opposition. At that time the major concern regarding trade in hazardous waste related to hazardous waste sent to another country for what is termed final disposal, that is, for incineration, landfilling or the like. As a result, the principal act defines waste as material which has been rejected as worthless or otherwise falls within the ordinary definition of waste. As such it generally does not cover material sent for recovery. In the years since the convention was negotiated the emphasis in international debate has shifted to its coverage of materials which are traded for recovery operations, that is, for reclamation of metals or recovery of other useful materials.
       </para>
       <break page="1339" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         Just as the trade in hazardous waste for final disposal led to an active process of transferring the environmental costs associated with the generation of hazardous waste from one country to another, and in particular from developed to developing countries, so the trade in hazardous waste for recovery operations can similarly lead to the transfer of environmental costs in an uncontrolled fashion.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Basel convention was drafted to cover both kinds of processes, that is, both final disposal and recovery operations, and both kinds of processes are included in the convention definitions under the single term `disposal'. The Australian act does not cover a wide range of hazardous wastes from which valuable materials are to be recovered; these hazardous wastes have not been rejected as worthless or do not fall within the ordinary meaning of waste. The major purpose of amending the act is to remedy this discrepancy between our international obligations and our domestic legislation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Basel convention is the primary international instrument under which trade in hazardous waste is controlled and, as I said, in 1989 we endorsed that. It is the set of rules for this trade on which Australia and the many other countries which are parties to the convention have agreed. As virtually all of Australia's trading partners are either parties to the convention or parties to similar sets of rules established by the OECD, it is in Australia's trade interests, as well as within our international obligations, to abide by these rules.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The interpretation of the convention as expressed in the principal act and with the amendments now put forward is in line with the views of other parties to the convention. In the absence of these amendments, Australia will continue to be out of step with other parties in its capacity to give domestic effect to the convention.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In accordance with the primary intention of the bill, the object of the act is to be amended to make it clear that one of its major aims is to give domestic effect to the Basel convention and other international instruments relating to trade in hazardous wastes.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The definition of hazardous waste, now to be adopted, is aligned with that in the convention. This will ensure that in future Australia does not find itself in breach of the convention by virtue of having adopted a definition which is at odds with the interpretation of the convention followed by others. Nevertheless, the question of definition remains central to the operation of the act and, indeed, definitional questions remain the subject of very active debate in Basel convention meetings. In Australia a higher degree of concern has been expressed because of the uncertainty of the definitions in the convention. The bill addresses these concerns through the establishment of a process to provide greater practical certainty regarding what is and is not a hazardous waste.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill provides for the establishment of a technical group of scientific and technical experts who will advise the minister on definitional questions. The advice of this group will be of great benefit in enabling the minister to decide whether he or she believes that a material falls within the definition of hazardous waste and so is regulated.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The minister will have the power to issue evidentiary certificates which will be prima facie evidence that a given material is or is not a hazardous waste. Also, by compiling a list of materials for which evidentiary certificates have been issued the minister will be able to provide greater certainty to those subject to regulation on what materials will be controlled and what will not.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This means, for example, that it will be possible to issue an evidentiary certificate stating that a material such as clean ferrous scrap is not a hazardous waste subject to the act and that
         <break page="1340" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          it can be traded without any controls. At the same time, flexibility will be retained to respond to incremental progress in international discussions on what materials should and should not be controlled. As an example, recent international discussions suggest that the existence of internationally recognised product specifications will be influential in deciding what are and are not hazardous wastes.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The evidentiary certificates will not be conclusive but will be prima facie evidence and the definitions in the act would remain as the final means of determining the definitional question. In practice, the advice of the technical group will provide the government with the capability of issuing clear guidance on definitional issues and should satisfy the needs of those who are subject to regulation for a clear understanding of their obligations under the act.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are many who would prefer to replace the uncertain Basel definitions with Australia's own list or set of criteria. To follow that course, however, would inevitably lead to Australia once again being at odds with the convention and the views of our trading partners on what constitutes hazardous waste under the convention. This would risk not only a breach of our international obligations but could well lead to shipments acceptable under our definitions being rejected at foreign ports to the embarrassment, cost and inconvenience of all.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The convention itself recognises that the hazard criteria it establishes are in need of further development. There is provision for the development of national tests which would provide greater precision in determining whether a waste is hazardous. That provision is included in the relevant annex to the convention by reference to which the bill defines hazardous waste. Over time the technical group will advise on national tests to establish hazard on a more certain basis, taking account of international developments.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another key concept in the convention now adopted into the act is the definition of `environmentally sound management'. The convention requires not only that an exporting country obtain prior consent from the country of import before allowing the transboundary movement to proceed, but also that the country of export requires that the waste to be shipped is managed in an environmentally sound way in the country of import.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The concept of environmentally sound management of hazardous waste is defined in the convention as taking all practicable steps to ensure that the hazardous waste is managed to protect human health and the environment. The technical group will advise the minister to assist in the determination of what constitutes environmentally sound management and whether particular facilities or processes meet the definition. For that reason it will include people with expertise in scientific and technical, social and economic, environmental and public health fields.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The concept of environmentally sound management as set out in the convention replaces the phrase in the principal act, `dispose of safely'. In the principal act, `dispose of safely' is defined in terms of an outcome, that is, that hazardous waste is disposed of safely provided there is no damage to human health or the environment. By contrast, `environmentally sound management' is defined now by reference to a process, that is, taking all practicable steps to prevent damage to human health and the environment. On the other hand, the definition of `dispose of safely' appears to exclude any assessment of effluents and emissions from the disposal process.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In practice, pragmatic considerations are likely to prevail. Within the Basel convention process detailed guidelines on what constitutes environmentally sound management have already been drafted and these will provide the context of the technical group's advice to the
         <break page="1341" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          minister. Australia will put its efforts into ensuring that those guidelines are sound. Once again the need to ensure that our legislation is fully in line with our international obligations is the overriding consideration in the changes set out in the bill.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Under the convention, the general rule is that parties must not trade in hazardous waste with non&amp;hyphen;parties. An exception to this is provided for in article 11, whereby parties may enter into agreements or arrangements either with other parties or with non&amp;hyphen;parties. These agreements or arrangements can set out controls which are different from those prescribed by the convention itself, provided those controls do not reduce the level of environment protection intended by the convention. The main such agreement to which Australia is a party is the OECD decision on transboundary movements of hazardous waste destined for recovery operations which regulates transboundary movements of hazardous wastes among OECD countries.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The bill provides explicitly for regulations giving effect to such agreements and arrangements and for those regulations to give domestic effect to rules different from those in the convention. The materials covered by the agreements or arrangements may also differ to some extent from those covered by the convention, thus the OECD decision covers some wastes which are not hazardous wastes under the convention and trade in these must comply with the controls set out by the decision. Conversely, the decision classifies some materials as non&amp;hyphen;hazardous wastes, known as the OECD green list, and these materials may be traded without a permit provided countries outside the OECD are not involved. The provisions are general and can be applied to any further article 11 agreements or arrangements which Australia enters into.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The procedures by which the minister reaches a decision on whether or not a permit should be issued for a transboundary movement have been amended once again to bring the act more closely into line with the convention. Among the changes are those ensuring that the notification and consent procedures established by the convention are followed. Another amends the existing provision that the minister have regard to the prospect of processing hazardous waste within Australia rather than allowing export to take place. This is in accordance with article 4(2)(d) of the convention which requires parties to `minimise the transboundary movement of hazardous waste consistent with the environmentally sound and efficient management of hazardous waste.' The intent of this article is met by requirements that disposal in Australia must be efficient, safe and environmentally sound. The intent is that a local disposal facility must be more than merely an experimental or test facility and must operate on a commercial basis. There must be some cost&amp;hyphen;effectiveness factor which is brought to bear when the minister weighs up the pros and cons of local versus overseas disposal in deciding whether or not a permit should be issued.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The principal act already provides that there must be appropriate insurance for shipments of hazardous waste before a permit is issued. A new provision in the bill allows the minister to require bonds or guarantees in addition to or instead of insurance. This recognises that where there is contravention of a permit for one reason or other, an insurance policy may not be paid out and in an appropriate case a bond would allow the Commonwealth to ensure that there was some coverage. In other cases insurance may not be available and a guarantee would provide the opportunity for a permit to be issued in such cases. The principal act allows the sum total of such arrangements—insurance bonds and guarantees—to be assessed when the minister comes to a decision.

        <break page="1342" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          Other procedural amendments are aimed at ensuring that the administration of the act proceeds smoothly and efficiently and that all convention requirements are met. Because the convention itself contains detailed rules, it has not been possible to simplify the administrative system beyond a certain point. That is why both the principal act and the amending bill are complex. Where possible and appropriate, provision is made for the making of regulations to set out requirements under the act in order to ensure that its administration will be flexible and responsive to the needs of industry. A detailed set of administrative procedures is being developed in consultation with interested parties, including industry, and will be completed by the time the amendments are ready to come into force.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The act also addresses a number of aspects of the convention which were not picked up in the original drafting process. One of the most important of these is the issue of transit permits—that is, for Australian consent or its denial to the transiting of waste from another country on its way to a third country for disposal. There is also explicit provision for more than one shipment of the same hazardous waste to be covered by a single permit. The convention allows such a procedure up to a maximum of 12 months provided that certain conditions are met and that is now reflected in the bill.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The current system for recovery of the government's administrative costs in respect of issuing permits is unnecessarily inflexible. The bill provides for fees to be set in regulations on the basis of administrative costs of each type of permit. The minister has discretion to reduce these where appropriate. The fee level may not be above the fee currently prescribed in the principal act. Penalties under the act have increased in order to provide a deterrent to illegal traffic. Prevention of illegal traffic is specifically required by the convention and the value of some of the transactions involved requires that penalties be raised to ensure that companies are deterred from failing to comply with the act's requirements.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          A new provision is that executive officers of companies will be personally liable for contraventions by companies with the onus of proof resting with the Commonwealth. That is, liability will not be automatic. Liability for executive officers of companies is an important step in ensuring compliance with the act, as it would be difficult for other compliance measures to be effective. For example, identification of hazardous waste at customs barriers when materials leave the country would often be difficult given that hazardous waste cannot readily be distinguished from a variety of other materials.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Third party standing under the principal act is already very broad with respect to appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Standing under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977, known as the ADJR Act, has been extended by providing standing for Australian organisations and associations which have matters which relate to the act as part of their object or purpose. This section is intended to extend but not limit the existing standing provisions which are provided under the ADJR Act. This will provide further legislative clarity to the standing rules for the purposes of the ADJR Act and as an extension of the standing rules already recognised in recent cases under other similar legislation. The extended standing provided by the bill relates only to persons or organisations living or incorporated in Australia, but persons or organisations from outside Australia could still obtain standing if they could otherwise demonstrate that they were `persons aggrieved' in terms of the ADJR Act.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The bill has been the subject of extensive consultations with a variety of groups, both inside and outside government. In particular, detailed consultations have been held with a policy reference group made up of representatives of industry, environment groups, development and
          <break page="1343" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           cooperation groups and unions. State and territory governments have also been consulted. An exposure draft of the bill was provided to members of the reference group and to the states and territories and comments have been taken into account in finalising the bill. In the course of the consultation an issue which has stimulated more discussion than any other is the prospect of bans on transboundary movement of hazardous waste from developed to developing countries. This issue was the subject of a decision at the second meeting of the conference of parties to the Basel convention in March 1994 and an amendment decision at the third conference of parties to the convention in September 1995. This latter decision, known as the ban amendment, implements an immediate ban on the export of hazardous waste for final disposals from countries listed in annex VII of the convention—parties and other states which are members of the OECD and the EC and Liechtenstein—to non&amp;hyphen;annex VII countries and phases out by the end of 1997 and bans from that date the export of hazardous waste for recovery operations from annex VII countries to non&amp;hyphen;annex VII countries.

          The export of waste for final disposal to developing countries, however, is not generally regarded as an acceptable practice. This is now reflected in the bill. Indeed, if I cast my mind back to 1989 when this bill was originally introduced, that was a matter of concern then. Indeed, the bill extends that policy by limiting exports for final disposal to any country to exceptional circumstances, such as where there is a direct risk to human health or environment if the waste remains in Australia, or if the wastes are being exported for research or testing. Each permit issued under this provision of the amended act will be specified in the regulations to ensure that the application of the concept of exceptional circumstances is transparent, and subject to scrutiny by the community.

          The extension of the definition of hazardous waste from that in the principal act to that in the convention will inevitably result in regulation of a far wider range of hazardous wastes than is the case at present. Studies which have been carried out recently into the range of wastes that may be covered by the Basel convention, and Australia's trade in them, suggest that the total trade may be somewhere between $100 and $200 million each year. The vast majority of this trade takes place with OECD countries, and is therefore subject to the less rigid controls set out by the OECD's decision.

         —This bill, the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1996 is a consolidated version, as we have heard, of the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1995, which was introduced by the Labor government in 1995 during the life of the last parliament. It incorporates a number of amendments moved by the previous Labor environment minister. The opposition, therefore, supports this bill.

       <para first-indent="16">
        As we have heard, the major reason for amending the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1989 was, and is still, the requirement to remedy the discrepancy that existed, or exists, between Australia's international obligation under the Basel convention and our domestic legislation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Basel convention is based on the following principles: the generation of hazardous wastes must be reduced to a minimum; where it is unavoidable, the waste must be disposed of as close as possible to the source of generation; hazardous wastes may not be exported to Antarctica or to states which are not parties either to the Basel convention or a treaty established under equivalent standards, or to parties which have banned all imports of such wastes, and in the case of any transboundary hazardous waste movements, the principles of environmentally sound management and disposal must be observed.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The aim of the Basel convention is therefore to reduce to a minimum the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes consistent with their safe management and disposal. The convention covers wastes destined for recycling as well as for final disposal.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The principal act's definition of hazardous waste, however, does not cover material sent for recovery operations. The principal act's definition of waste is confined to material which is worthless. This definition has previously been construed as excluding wastes destined for
        <break page="1345" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         recovery or recycling operations. This means the act does not comply with Australia's obligations under the convention.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The opposition clearly supports making Australia's legislation conform to the international convention as closely as possible. We also support the establishment of the technical group of scientific and technical experts to advise the minister on definitional questions. This group will provide advice to the minister on what is and is not a hazardous waste under the bill's definition of hazardous waste. The technical group will provide the government with the capability of issuing clear guidance on definitional issues.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The amendment bill removes the phrase `dispose of safely' and replaces it with the concept of environmentally sound management. Environmentally sound management of hazardous wastes or other wastes is defined in the convention as follows:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . taking all practicable steps to ensure that hazardous wastes or other wastes are managed in a manner which will protect human health and the environment against adverse effects which may result from such wastes.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have been assured by the minister and his department that the replacement of `dispose of safely' from the principal act does not translate to a weakening of Australia's commitment to environmental protection.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We accept this assurance, although obviously we will be checking it very closely, and we also acknowledge the wisdom in our domestic legislation mirroring the international convention as closely as possible. But it should not be to the detriment of standards.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        However, since the opposition has actually done all the work in developing this legislation, it would like an assurance from the minister representing the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) that the amended legislation receives the administrative support that is required to see it properly implemented. This is the most important point I want to make today.

        I have been informed that the new government intends—and this is very alarming—to dismantle the Environment Protection Agency's waste management branch. This is the body in the federal government which administers a number of international conventions including the Basel convention. It also develops protocols on important environmental matters such as sea dumping and agricultural chemicals.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It would seem rather ironic, to say the least, that, at the very same time this parliament is passing amending legislation that will ensure Australia's law accurately reflects its international obligations, the Minister for the Environment is dismantling the arm of government responsible for the legislation's proper administration. It would be a very curious outcome indeed. Indeed, I think it would be an outcome that would be condemned widely not just by environment groups in this country but also by industry and by our international partners.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Are we today creating a legal facade, legislation without the necessary administrative and technical support? I would like the minister representing the Minister for the Environment, although he is not here at the moment, to guarantee that the EPA's waste management branch will not disappear and indeed, will be resourced at the same level or better than it was under the previous Labor government, otherwise what we are going through here right now is a farce and Australia will not be able to guarantee that it can meet its international obligations.

        This bill has been subject to an extensive consultation process and has wide industry support, and the opposition will support it. But we do so, knowing that the whole process of meeting our international obligations will be placed in jeopardy if the government disbands that section

         —The government has introduced new rules to ensure that Australia does not take on international obligations without proper scrutiny in the parliament. But that does not imply that we are proposing to take our international obligations lightly. Quite the contrary: our intention is to ensure that we fully understand what international rules mean for Australia before we give effect to them.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This legislation rectifies a situation in which Australia took on international rules without properly understanding their implications. As a result, the legislation that was passed has been found to be out of step with international practice and international law. We are now putting into place a more thorough legislative instrument to ensure that Australia meets conscientiously the obligations taken on almost exactly four years ago when the convention came into force.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is not only in accordance with our international obligations that the current act needs amendment. The act as it stands is cumbersome and inflexible, and needs adjusting to ensure that it can be administered efficiently and with the flexibility needed in the various circumstances that are likely to occur from time to time.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The extension of the ambit of this act to include wastes for recovery and recycling is highly significant. It brings under the act a far wider range of materials than has been covered up to now. These materials include many metal bearing weights. Some of these are things such as spent lead acid batteries which are heavily traded around the world, and where most parties accept that the trade can easily involve subjecting other countries and their communities to significant environmental risks associated with secondary smelting of lead.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Other materials are the secondary materials produced in metal refining. There are processes established by this act to ensure that careful attention is paid to whether these materials should be judged to be wastes or not, and whether they are hazardous or not. In general, only if they pass both tests—that is, that they are both wastes and hazardous—will they be covered by the act.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        These processes are necessary to ensure that the act does not inadvertently pick up materials which do not present an environmental threat and should not be regulated. Most of Australia's trade in hazardous waste, especially in the last couple of years, has occurred with other countries of the OECD. In 1992, OECD countries agreed on a separate and particular regime for managing trade in hazardous waste, using a listing system dividing hazardous waste into red, amber and green categories on the basis of comparative hazard.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Under the Basel convention such an agreement is possible and the act makes provision for such agreements to be given recognition and for their rules to be established by regulation. One of the conditions is that the rules established by such separate agreements would not reduce the level of environment protection provided.

        This bill has been the subject of extensive consultation processes. As is the nature of things, not everybody involved in those consultations finds every aspect of the bill ideal. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that the bill has been substantially improved by the discussions that have taken place on it and the final outcomes represent the most satisfactory reconciliation of
        <break page="1347" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         competing interest that could be arrived at. Industry interests have advised that they support passage of this bill.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        All international instruments relating to trade in hazardous waste have been troubled by controversy on how to accurately define hazardous waste and also on the degree to which hazardous waste should be treated as a range of materials for which separate arrangements are needed. Countries of the OECD solve this problem by drawing up detailed lists of wastes and developing a control system with varying degrees of restraint, depending on how hazardous the waste is.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Basel convention set up a somewhat different system which relied on a short list of waste streams and contaminates, and a list of hazards. The trouble with this system was that it did not provide the level of certainty which countries actually needed when they were trying to give effect to the convention on a case by case basis.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In September last year, at the third meeting of the conference of the parties, there was agreement that priority attention should be given to reducing the uncertainties surrounding which wastes are covered by the convention. Several meetings have now been held. Progress has been encouraging, and at the most recent meeting of the convention's technical working group in Kuala Lumpur last month delegates arrived at a provisional listing of wastes, which goes some considerable way towards providing the certainty that Australia and other countries have been seeking.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The draft lists drawn up include those agreed to be subject to the convention, those agreed not to be subject to the convention, those on which a decision has yet to be taken, and even some which perhaps ought to be subject to the convention but appear not to be. These lists as yet have no legal significance and that cannot be expected for some time. However, they do provide useful guidance to countries in making decisions about what materials should and should not be covered. I would merely note here that many of the materials of most concern to Australia have now been settled, including many now on the list of non&amp;hyphen;wastes. That has provided considerable reassurance to parts of industry.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There has been criticism in some quarters of the Basel convention as a piece of international law. Most international conventions are inherently imperfect, negotiated as they are by compromise amongst countries whose vital interests all differ. On the other hand, most international conventions allow a degree of flexibility in their application. Concerns over the Basel convention will not be resolved by pointing out its flaws. They will only be resolved by working within the convention forums for a process of incremental improvement. These are the rules that our trading partners have agreed to and we must proceed hand in hand with them in the process of debate and discussion aimed at generating better outcomes both for the international environment and for Australia's trading interests.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The debate about trade and the environment is a very active one and the Basel convention is a concrete example of that debate. We can use the convention in some ways as a test case in order to find solutions which provide the best level of environment protection for the vulnerable, without imposing unnecessary constraints upon trade. The debate on these issues in Australia has been a lively one and we are now well positioned to contribute to international discussions in a constructive and helpful manner.

        There is plenty of lively debate in Australia these days on environmental issues—and I would say so there should be. Last year there were significant protests over nuclear testing in the South Pacific and expressions of fears and concern for that environment and the South

Now we will have, and I am sure we will continue to have, community discussion and, I believe, ultimate anger as minority groups join forces in the other place to prevent the implementation of our $1 billion Natural Heritage Trust of Australia.

        Environment and hazardous waste issues should be considered globally and locally. There are in my own electorate a number of local environment issues that I have addressed on other occasions. One such issue is a very important one, and that has been the dumping of over 200,000 tonnes of hazardous waste at the Australian National site at the Islington Railyards at Kilburn. The former Minister for Transport and now shadow minister for foreign affairs (Mr Brereton) announced a $5 million clean&amp;hyphen;up of part of that site, believe it or not, three or four days before the election was announced.

         —I am very glad to see the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill make a return to the government's political agenda. It was first introduced by the previous government last year. The bill covers areas of the transportation of hazardous waste where Australia is certainly lagging behind the rest of the developed world. As the previous Minister for Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, put so succinctly in March last year when he introduced the bill, `The existing Commonwealth legislation fails to meet our obligations under the Basel convention.'

        The Basel convention—as indicated by other speakers—was adopted in 1989 and ratified by Australia in 1992. It ties its signatories to a stringent code of conduct in the transportation and trade of hazardous waste—a code which we have been guilty of neglecting. As a nation

         which prides itself on its integrity in its dealings with the international community, as a nation which regards its diligence in meeting its international obligations as an example from which others can learn, we cannot afford to drag our feet any longer on such an internationally important issue as the transportation of hazardous waste.

        Over the last 10 to 20 years, as we have become more attuned to the needs of our environment, we have been led to ask ourselves some difficult questions about the transportation and disposal of toxic waste products. This bill is another example of how we have slowly begun to educate ourselves. It is an example of the steps that we must take in order to reverse our environment's dire state of health. Some say that these lessons are being learnt too late and too slowly. It is hard not to disagree when one can see all around us the devastation of our environment continuing, seemingly unabated.

        Depending on whom we talk to, we find that Australia's record on protecting the environment on both a national and an international level is either commendable or contemptible. It is true that we have led the way on certain environmental issues.

        However, we are presently viewed with a jaundiced eye by our neighbours in the South Pacific for not supporting the Association of Small Island States' proposal to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2005.

        In relation to the trade of hazardous waste, our recent history is similarly chequered. Per capita, between 1990 and 1993, Australia exported three times more hazardous waste than did the United States—a shameful position to find ourselves in. Those responsible for trading Australia's waste overseas have in the past taken advantage of a loophole which exists in the present act—namely, its definition of waste differs from that used by the Basel convention. Thankfully, the present bill will change this situation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the past, under the guise of `recycling', Australia has sent thousands of tonnes of toxic waste to darken our neighbours' doorsteps, rather than face the problem ourselves. This has all been done without contravening the 1989 act, but it is, I believe, still against the spirit of the convention.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Because waste products intended for recycling were not covered by the previous act, there was no requirement for companies to report the export of such products to the Australian authorities and in turn no prior informed consent was obtained from the countries of import. Nor was there any inquiry made as to whether these wastes would be managed in an environmentally sound manner by the importing state. The environmental organisation Greenpeace has since reported that waste exported by Australia for recycling has routinely been treated by importing countries in south&amp;hyphen;east Asia in an unsafe manner which has resulted in damages to human health and the environment in those countries. I wonder, how many Australians are aware of this state of affairs? Who would not be appalled at the thought of our waste destroying the lives of others?

         As was mentioned in the other House during debate on this bill, in 1994 Australia was the main exporter of lead acid batteries to Indonesia. In 1992, we exported more than 11,000 tonnes of lead acid batteries, compared with the United Kingdom's 700 tonnes in 1993. In the following year, we exported 20,000 kilograms of lead battery waste to Hong Kong.

         Up until now, lead battery acid would be considered a hazardous waste by anyone's definition—anyone's definition, it appears, but ours. Lead battery acid is a destructive pollutant and, if not disposed of correctly, can seriously affect people's health and safety. However, in the past we have considered such waste as a `good, intended for recycling' and, as such, it was excluded from control under the act. Again, this is a situation which I am pleased this bill will now rectify.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Yet as much as I commend the bill, I also think it raises just as many questions as it seeks to answer. It raises questions, not just about our past conduct in regard to the trade of serious toxic waste, but also it raises basic questions which reflect upon the desire of government and of the Australian people to change the way we live in order to produce less waste and in so doing, save our collective hides.

         While I am pleased to see that we are strengthening our position on such an important environmental issue as the transportation of hazardous waste, I think that we have largely missed another central provision of the Basel convention, and that is that the contracting parties shall:

         Simply by taking a look around our cities and our towns—not just at the factories and the waste stations, but also at our homes and our local rubbish tips—we can see that this is quite obviously not happening. Our generation of waste continues without interruption.

         We often hear our leaders talking about the economic ramifications of living beyond our means.

         The thing that alarms me, and which the debate surrounding this bill has constantly raised, is that despite the warnings and the future global emergencies which scientists and naturalists alert us to, Australians continue to produce waste at an alarming rate of knots. Approach virtually anyone in the street and ask that person about the state of the Australian or, in fact, the global environment. More than likely, if he or she has read a newspaper or watched the television in the last 10 years, that person will say, `Oh yeah, it is dreadful, isn't it? We have got to do something about that.' Or, the comment will be, `Don't worry, they'll find an answer.'

         In a poll taken by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in May of 1992, 70.3 per cent of respondents considered that environmental concerns and economic growth had equal importance. And 18.8 per cent considered that environmental concerns were more important than economic growth. Yet despite their good intentions, most Australians are inadvertently part of the waste&amp;hyphen;producing juggernaut. Australians may feel strongly about the environment, but we continue to buy products wrapped in excessive and unnecessary packaging. When we shop, we fill up half a dozen plastic bags, which we promptly dispose of upon returning home—and I am as guilty as others. The vast majority of Australians have not twigged to the link between our devastated environment and our rampant waste&amp;hyphen;producing consumerism.

          When people say, `We have got to do something about it,' most mean `we' as referring to the government. Or, when people say, `They will find an answer,' most mean the teams of scientists and researchers in whom they place all their trust. And yet while the government and the scientists have enormous responsibilities, part of which we are fulfilling here today, Australians have to start recognising that they can, and must, play an important role in doing something about it as well. We can no longer live our lives on this earth saying, `Damn the consequences,' or we will find the consequences have, in fact, damned us.

         As evidence of this point, I would like the members present to pay particularly close attention to some of the following figures, which I have researched. In 1988, every man, woman and child in Sydney generated the equivalent of a tonne of waste. That is over three million tonnes of waste in one year. Eight years ago these figures were taken out. Considering the fact that our nation's population is growing at the rate of 1.2 per cent each year—similar in size to Wollongong's population of 220,000—this is a situation which I doubt would have improved. Rather, it is one that would have become worse. Members should also be aware that this figure does not include the 70,000 motor vehicles and two million tyres discarded by Sydneysiders in that year.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The domestic garbage disposed of by Sydneysiders in our bicentennial year included paper to the equivalent of one million trees—enough timber, incidentally, Mr Deputy Speaker, to build 40,000 homes; enough glass to make 200 million soft drink bottles; enough metal to construct 75,000 new cars; and two billion drink containers' worth of plastic. This was all discarded just in Sydney. From these figures, it is not surprising that it has been estimated that Sydney, in particular, will run out of landfill sites before the turn of the century.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In relation to the ecological footprint, or ecological impact, made by Sydneysiders, it takes 4.5 hectares of productive land now to support each individual in this campaign of consumption. That is 4.5 hectares compared to an average of 1.7 hectares across the world. Putting it plainly, every Australian affects the environment 20 times more than every Indonesian. Sydneysiders and, I assume, all Australians have lived with what environmentalists call the myth of disposal for far too long. For far too long we have taken it as a given that we could take out of the earth whatever we wanted and we could throw away whatever we liked and it would never affect us.

         Of course, the age of recycling has also well and truly begun; yet I am afraid that recycling on its own is not going to be enough. What we need to do is reduce our waste, be it toxic, hazardous or otherwise. If we can succeed in reducing our incredibly high levels of waste, then the question of how to dispose of it—whether by landfill, incineration or export—will no longer be as pressing. It is obvious that the message is just not getting through to average Australians. As I have said before, they have not yet twigged to the link between their lifestyles and the damage to the environment. We will not be able to cut down our levels of waste while continuing to live in the way to which we have become accustomed. Compromise, unfortunately, will not get us there.

         Further to the questions the bill raises about our level of waste production, I think it also raises serious questions about the extent to which Australia wishes to lead the world on environmental matters. Does Australia want to show the flag, or will it continue, as is the case with this bill, to play catch&amp;hyphen;up, doing only the bare minimum required by its international obligations or when pressured by its trading partners or the sway of world opinion?

         As has been stated by other speakers, this bill is all about bringing ourselves into line with the other signatories to the Basel convention. But we are not going any further. We are not inspiring our international partners such as the United States—which, incidentally, remains conspicuously absent from the membership roll of the convention—to go further with us. We are simply doing the bare minimum required.

         Those rules are the ones laid down by the Basel convention. But does he not see our adherence to the convention as also being an important environmental statement to the rest of the world? Does he not see it as also being an important step in putting an end to Australia's role in the shameful environmental degradation of our neighbours through the exportation of our toxic waste? This is the sort of political approach that we need to change. And to do so we need to change opinions at ground level.

         The recent tragedy in Port Arthur showed how quickly politicians and governments were able to come together and produce a solution to the problems of gun control in this country. The plans devised by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and supported by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and the state premiers have received almost total support from the Australian people. Unfortunately, it took a tragedy in order to get action from our leaders and to change the opinions of Australians.

         As I said, Senator Hill's second reading speech on this bill was indicative of the political mind&amp;hyphen;set we need to overcome if we are to salvage our environment. While I appreciate that the political realities of economics and business continue to tie our hands, and while I understand that blind idealism will never get us anywhere, I hope that one day we will reach the point when environmental legislation is passed not because we look bad or suffer economically if we fail to have it passed, but because it makes environmental sense—first and foremost. Perhaps it is too much of a homily, but if we do not change the way we think now, as Australians and as international citizens, those same economic ties will become like anvils around our necks as the chance to restore this country's environment slips beyond our grasp.

We should stand up and we should lead. If it means that at times we are going to suffer for it economically, I believe the average Australian will understand and appreciate that if it is explained to them what the long&amp;hyphen;term ramifications of not taking these decisions could mean to them, to their children and to their children's children.

         We cannot continue to complain and to whinge when a particular bill comes before the House. The pressure must be applied continually to make sure that legislation is enacted so that Australia stands proudly as a nation; to make sure that we will lead by example and start cleaning up at our own doorstep the environmental problems we have created through industry and through grabbing the short term economic return for so many years in the past.

         —I acknowledge the vigorous contribution from the previous speaker, the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), and her interest in this topic. I also wish to make a contribution on the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill, which is generating considerable interest in the parliament.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The object of this bill, as stated in the act, is to regulate the export, import and transit of hazardous waste to ensure that exported, imported or transited waste is managed in an environmentally sound manner so that human beings and the environment, both within and outside Australia, are protected from the harmful effects of the waste. The aims of the bill are to give effect to the Basel Convention on Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, and to agreements and arrangements of the kind mentioned in article 11 of the convention—that is the article that is particularly concerned with bilateral, multilateral and regional agreements.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Briefly, the Basel convention was adopted in the city of Basel in Switzerland on 22 March 1989. It entered into force, as they say, one year later in March 1990, and Australia acceded to it on 5 February 1992. The Basel convention is the primary international instrument under which trade in hazardous waste is controlled. It is the set of rules for this trade on which Australia and many other countries that are parties to the convention have agreed. As virtually all of Australia's trading partners are either parties to the convention or parties to similar sets of rules established by the OECD, it is in Australia's trade interests, as well as within our international obligations, to abide by these rules. If we do not do so we may find ourselves in an embarrassing situation when we send this sort of waste overseas, as we do from time to time, that shipments may be rejected at other countries.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The act, when implemented, will also give greater certainty as to what is and is not hazardous waste. A technical group will oversee that and make recommendations to the minister, who will issue evidentiary certificates.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I believe total trade in hazardous waste around the world is not massive. There is about $100 million to $200 million worth each year, the majority of which takes place within OECD countries. As I understand it, something of the order of 350 million tonnes of hazardous waste is generated in the world annually. Australia, at present, does not have the facilities to deal with some of these wastes generated in the processes of making hexachlorobenzene, polychlorinated biphenyls—the PCBs; and the dioxins. These are found in plastics, pesticides, refrigerants, fire extinguishers and solvents et cetera, so certainly Australia, as a developed country, does have an interest in this matter.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I would like to contrast the handling and the problems of hazardous waste that previous speakers have mentioned with similar problems that have been encountered with nuclear waste. There are lessons in that industry that I think are pertinent to this industry. Most radioactive waste in Australia is generated from ANSTO, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, at Lucas Heights in Sydney. We produce radiopharmaceuticals, radioisotopes and radiochemicals, which we use in the field of medicine and in many industries and for research purposes. Australia has benefited from those for some decades now because they improve our health. They are used for diagnoses in particular, as well as for the treatment of certain diseases such as cancer. They have saved lives in this country; they have enhanced the environment in the way we have been able to use them; and they benefit many industries, particularly the agricultural industry. In fact, so fast is nuclear medicine growing at present—I believe the growth rate is about 14 per cent cumulative every year—that of everyone alive today about 50 per cent can expect to have some nuclear medicine procedure, whether it be for diagnosis or treatment, some time in their lifetime.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In saying all this, I want to stress that the reactor at Lucas Heights is a very small one. The total fuel load is only about seven kilograms compared with, say, a power generating plant which would have about 190 tonnes of fuel there and it is enriched to about 60 per cent uranium 235. The vast bulk of the waste that comes from the nuclear industry in Australia is not high&amp;hyphen;level waste at all—in fact, only about three per cent of it by volume, even though that contains about 95 per cent of the radioactivity. We send overseas most of the high&amp;hyphen;level waste and in that regard we abide by international treaties, not unlike the Basel convention on hazardous waste.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is the low&amp;hyphen;level waste, and the way we have treated it in an irrational manner in Australia, that I just want to make some comments on. This low&amp;hyphen;level waste is about 90 per cent of the volume, even though it is only one per cent of the radioactivity. There is of course the intermediate&amp;hyphen;level waste which takes up about seven per cent of the volume and makes up about four per cent of the radioactivity.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The low&amp;hyphen;level waste comes from hospitals, laboratories, industries such as the aircraft industry and primary industry, et cetera. It is not some dreadful hazardous waste. It is mainly clothing such as overalls and goggles. The low&amp;hyphen;level waste is made up of other things such as paper and rags, tools, air filters in buildings, et cetera. It does not require special shielding during its handling and transport. In fact, it is suitable for shallow land burial. It is usually compacted into 200 litre drums—the old 44&amp;hyphen;gallon drums—or it is incinerated and the ash is put into drums. A certain amount of intermediate&amp;hyphen;level waste comes from resins, chemical sludges, reactor components, metal fuel claddings and so on. This is also solidified and needs some shielding in concrete or bitumen.

          What Australia needs is a national repository for this relatively harmless waste. Previous governments, including the present opposition when it was in government, recognised this and a search was conducted throughout Australia for a low-populated, arid and seismically stable area. In the early 1990s, eight such sites were identified. One of those sites falls partly in western New South Wales—the Olary area. It is an area of about 48,000 square kilometres, taking in Broken Hill on its south&amp;hyphen;eastern boundary.

Everybody went so bananas about it that there could be no rational debate in this country about it at all, and all political parties shelved it. I can understand the emotion, but a lot of it was based on total misinformation. If we pass the bill today, it will be a step forward.

It is quite clear, as the previous speaker, the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) said, that we need uniform legislation and we need legislation for the safe storage of waste material. The alternative, of course, is unsafe storage. I get mightily confused by those people who protest at every attempt to seek safe storage for this material but who are quite happy to leave it lying scattered around our cities. It is a nonsense.

        As the previous speaker said, there is a close correlation between hazardous waste and nuclear waste. Nuclear waste is an area in which I do have some expertise. In 1974, the policy of the Australian Labor Party was to mine, process and reprocess uranium. I was one of the people instrumental in changing that policy, and I thought I had achieved a great thing when we completely reversed the policy.

        So enthusiastic was I that I went to France at my own expense to campaign against nuclear energy because I rightly divined that Australia is really irrelevant in the world scheme of things and that we had to stop it in France. I spent many months travelling across France, standing up in picture theatres and heckling the French on the evils of nuclear energy, and standing in supermarkets doing surveys, assisted by my wife, who did the French speaking. I also visited establishments and talked to people.

        It took me some months to realise that what I was saying was absolute nonsense. So I changed my mind. I have made it a policy in life that, when I am wrong, I change my mind.

        It appals me that I hear today, some 20 years later, people regurgitating the arguments I used to put—and, I think, generally not putting them as well. They are exactly the same arguments, which have no substance. In my electorate I have the Monte Bellos, where there was significant nuclear testing in the 1950s. It is a great part of Australia. The fishing there is like none you have ever seen before, and now it looks like being a very important oil province.

        I might add something from my own experience. When I was campaigning—I think it was in the election we had in the mid&amp;hyphen;1980s—there was talk about storing waste at a place just out of Southern Cross called Koolyanobbing. It was an iron ore mine that had ceased operation on economic grounds. They were talking about putting in a destruction plant there, principally for the destruction of PCBs. I arrived at Southern Cross and was met by one of the local state members. I said, `Give me a bit of advice.' He said, `Oppose this installation.' I said to him, `But I do not oppose it. I actually support it.' `It does not matter,' he said, `oppose it. The election will be over in a couple of weeks.' I said, `I cannot do that. I am going to support it.' I guess I was buoyed in my integrity by the fact that I knew I could survive without any votes in Southern Cross. But I went out there and said that I thought the material could be stored safely and this was what we should do, and my vote in Southern Cross, in fact, went up. So I believe that people are amenable to reasoned arguments. Unfortunately, they tend not

        That is a totally different reaction from the measured response of John Major in England—a man under enormous pressure, who clearly does need to raise his profile. What did they do in Britain? They sent the gun issue off to a committee, under a peer of the realm, to be discussed in all aspects. The result is that the British will know what went wrong at Dunblane. They will know why it did, whether it could have been predicted, all the ins and outs. In Australia we will not because we have taken our action—we are just going to ban guns, which will have no effect whatsoever on the outcome. Of course it will not, because what happened in Hobart was a mental health problem, not a gun problem. I am digressing there, and I thank the chair for his tolerance.

        Let me get back to waste storage. I have in my electorate one of those areas designated as a suitable site for waste storage—Mount Walter. It is 70 kilometres west of Coolgardie. I remember that a few elections ago an anti&amp;hyphen;waste dump party ran in Coolgardie against the state member, on the basis that they did not want the stuff in their backyard, some 70 kilometres away. They do have large backyards out there! The result of it was that the state member, Julian Grill, increased his majority. So, I think, if you take the trouble to explain to people the hard facts—the truth—you can convince them.

        Mount Walter would be a suitable site for fairly toxic waste and certainly for medium&amp;hyphen;level radioactive material. In fact, a French company, Rhone&amp;hyphen;Poulenc, is mining around the Pinjarra area and it is seeking to downstream&amp;hyphen;process, to extract from this material the rare earths, which have a clear value and a much greater value than simply in exporting the raw material.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        When the company first started, the argument coming from the Green movement was that we could not trust the French to ship the stuff overseas because it contained the radioactive element thorium, which of course is included in every bit of granite. I can tell new members of parliament that this new Parliament House is certainly many times more radioactive than the Old Parliament House. The background radiation here would be considerably higher than you would get in lots of parts of Australia, owing to the enormous amount of granite here and the enormous concrete platform on which this place floats—because we have built it on a geological flaw. But do not worry: the radiation is still well within any safe limits.

        The company was told that, because it was French, it could not be trusted to export the stuff, because the wicked French would extract the thorium and maybe make bombs.

They can export the rare earths, but they must take the radioactive waste with them.' It was
        <break page="1360" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        Anyhow, I accept radioactive waste in my electorate. It is, I guess, medium&amp;hyphen;level waste. It would be mainly gamma&amp;hyphen;radiating and, if it is stored as proposed—in plastic containers six feet below the ground—we return, of course, to background levels of radiation. Mount Walter is ideally suited. Firstly, it has a low rainfall; secondly, it has internal drainage; thirdly, if there is any underground water at all, it is hyper&amp;hyphen;saline and there is not much of it; and, fourthly, it is geologically very stable. I have made it clear that I would be prepared to store high&amp;hyphen;level waste in my electorate, and this is a position I have always made clear to my constituents. Since they have always returned me, it would seem there is some measure of agreement there.

        However, the goldfields generally are booming. This is an area of dynamic growth in Australia. The same cannot be said for Broken Hill, and it may well be that this is an industry that Broken Hill needs, if it is going to continue to exist at all. Unless there are more ore bodies found at Broken Hill, it is inevitably going to become another ghost town or one depending increasingly, as it appears to be, on tourism. I left Broken Hill in 1959. I left just ahead of the police. I had not been back for many years but I was disappointed, when I went back, to see that it had become very much a tourist place, and not the working town that I knew it as.

I am convinced it is perfectly safe. It is just that synroc is much safer, although it is slightly more expensive, and it is something that I believe should have been pursued with vigour. Had the Australian Labor Party had the policy it had in 1956, there could have been be a future for it, because mining, processing and waste reprocessing could have led to the establishment of a big industry in Australia.

I am sure that there is a multi&amp;hyphen;billion dollar industry that Australia could run very well, and Australia could play a very important part in providing this service to the world. That is far better, in my view, than to not know what people are doing with their intractable waste, and I think there is a lot of fear raised in the community.

        There was a lot of emotion about Parkes where some birds had been killed on the tailings dam. This can actually happen if cyanide levels are not properly controlled—and the birds died.

If 10 per cent of the bird population had died—it was nothing like that figure—that population would certainly recover in a couple of years.

Their method of survival is to ringbark around their holes to protect themselves from goannas and, because they are nesting there in such numbers on the few remaining trees, they are tending to ringbark those trees, and the trees are dying.

The issue of the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes raises significant moral questions, which the Basel convention attempts to address.

        Honourable members will remember the outcry in the Australian community in 1993 over blood lead levels and their health consequences. The National Health and Medical Research Council revealed that new research indicated that previously accepted blood lead levels of 25 micrograms per decilitre had been too high and that an alarm should be raised when blood lead levels reached 10 micrograms per decilitre.

        The Australian community was angry in 1993 when it was realised that we had a problem with lead levels in our own children. Yet Australian companies are transporting hazardous wastes to countries where the processing of the materials contributes to the poisoning of their environments and their people, some of whom have blood lead levels up to four to eight times higher than the level we find acceptable. It is unconscionable that we should be outraged at the lead levels in our own children, but continue with practices that contribute to the lead poisoning of children in Indonesia or any other country.

        The minister's second reading speech summarised the major features of the bill. But one of the most important features is that it will require exporters of hazardous wastes to ensure that the waste materials will be managed in an environmentally sound manner which protects human health and the environment before exportation is permitted. This is a significant advance to ensure that Australia meets its obligations under the Basel convention and I commend the bill to the committee.

        This debate is in a sense a timely one, as there is a very important community debate occurring in my electorate at this time, relating to a decision by the Victorian government to relocate the Coode Island chemicals complex to Point Lillias. As members may recall, in August 1991 a disastrous fire occurred at the Coode Island chemical storage facility, which prompted the then Victorian government to undertake an extensive review of alternative sites in Victoria for the construction of a facility to replace the Coode Island chemical waste facility.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Coode Island review panel nominated several sites as being the most appropriate ones for the transfer of the Coode Island facility, and one of those sites was West Point Wilson which was eventually determined to be the site of the east coast armaments complex to be relocated from New South Wales to Victoria. Interestingly enough, when the Coode Island review panel examined these issues, the site at Point Lillias was not one of the sites recommended in that review; yet the Kennett government has determined that the Coode Island facility will be relocated to Point Lillias.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That decision has certainly excited a great degree of local opposition. The Coode Island complex has had some improvements done to it after the fire, and it is now regarded as being safe. Many people in my community in Geelong are asking why, if it is so safe, the facility cannot be turned into a state&amp;hyphen;of&amp;hyphen;the&amp;hyphen;art facility where it is—located close to chemical industries in Victoria—and not moved to the Geelong area, where there are significant environmental, heritage, economic and transport concerns.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I would like to briefly go through some of those concerns. As far as the environment is concerned, the area around Point Lillias is a significant wetland area with saltpans and salt marshes. It is one of the remaining underdeveloped areas of Port Phillip Bay. As far as Corio Bay is concerned, it is a shallow bay and it has sluggish tidal movements that would worsen the effects of any unintentional spills from a complex at Point Lillias.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The wetland areas around Corio Bay and the Point Lillias area have international conservation status and are an important habitat for migratory wading birds, such as the double&amp;hyphen;banded plover. The area is protected under the Ramsar agreement, which is an
        <break page="1365" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         international convention with between 80 and 90 signatory nations. Of particular concern to the environmentalists is the threat to the orange&amp;hyphen;bellied parrot, which one of the rarest birds in the world with only 200 of them remaining in existence. The community is also concerned that the dredging and shoreline filling works will cause significant environmental damage. Keep in mind that the original Coode Island review panel did not even rate Point Lillias as one of the five major recommended sites for the relocation of the Coode Island complex.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are significant transport concerns with the Point Lillias site. The chemicals that are to be stored there would have to be transported from Melbourne and this would mean significant truck movements, estimated to be in the order of 100 to 200 a day, along the Princes Highway. That particular highway is estimated, at the turn of the century, to be a pretty clogged highway—if I can put it in those terms—and the additional truck movements on it will not only cause congestion problems but also pose a significant environmental threat in their own right.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As for the heritage concerns, they have been articulated by the Aboriginal community. There are significant Aboriginal sites in the Point Lillias area. Community groups are really angered by the state government's lack of consultation or interest in local concerns of Aboriginal and other groups.

        In an economic sense, the Point Lillias project is not a desirable development because it is located some three to four kilometres from Avalon airport, which is currently up for sale. There are some very interesting developments being proposed for Avalon airport that involve the creation of a clean&amp;hyphen;green production zone in the environs of the airport and the establishment of a dedicated airfreight facility there for the export of perishable foods directly into Asian markets. That particular concept involves the development of the Avalon area as a clean&amp;hyphen;green production zone for perishable foods and flowers. The big marketing angle for that development will be the clean&amp;hyphen;green image of the foods that are produced and exported through Avalon. The Point Lillias chemicals complex some five kilometres from the runway may stifle the potential economic benefits that could accrue to the region and, indeed, to Australia from the development of the Avalon complex.

        I think that here we have a contrast in the styles of the Commonwealth and state governments when it comes to these very significant matters. As far as the Commonwealth relocation of the Newington armaments depot to the Point Wilson site is concerned, we have seen an exhaustive process of consultation with the local community and evaluation of the appropriateness of that site. This contrasts with the Victorian government which has just plucked Point Lillias out of the air in ignorance of the recommendations of the Coode Island review panel that listed five potential sites and did not even rate Point Lillias on that list.

        I will now talk about the bill, the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1996. The Basel Convention on Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal was adopted on 22 March 1989. Australia acceded to it on 5 February 1992. This bill aims to end some discrepancies which have emerged during the operation of the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act, an act designed to give effect to the Basel convention in Australian law. One such discrepancy is the definition of what constitutes hazardous waste. These amendments will ensure that the definitions used
        <break page="1367" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         in Australian law meet those that the convention intended and that Australia is no longer out of line with international opinion on this subject.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        One of the problems of the previous definition of hazardous waste was that it was confined to material deemed to be worthless. This definition excluded wastes exported for recycling or for recovery. Because Australia does not require approval for these types of exports, follow&amp;hyphen;up inquiries are not undertaken about whether the waste is to be treated in an environmentally appropriate way in the destination and transit countries. This is in clear breach of the Basel convention. The convention specifically calls on signatory countries to prohibit exports when they are not going to be treated in an environmentally sound manner once they have left the exporting country. Amending the definition of hazardous waste to include recycling exports will make certain that these are subjected to the same level of scrutiny. Even if Australia's environmental legislation and monitoring programs were the best in the world, Australia would always, to a large extent, be dependent on the environmental actions of other nations. That is why it is in our best interests to see that international standards are adhered to in other countries as well.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In a global context, there does not seem to be much point to handling hazardous waste in an environmentally sensitive manner if the waste is then exported to a country where it leads to untold damage to the environment. Technical terminology is an important issue in the operation of any convention. It is especially important that definitions and standards are uniform so that the intent of the convention is not undermined.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Obviously the government acknowledges and accepts the importance of uniform definitions and standards enough to put this amendment bill up. I take this to mean that the government accepts that there is a role for the Commonwealth when it comes to establishing standards and definitions and, indeed, measuring outcomes against these criteria. With talk of handing powers back to the states on a whole host of issues, including the environment, sadly the government does not appear very committed to this concept.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        At the same time as the House debates a bill about world standards of the disposal of hazardous waste, talk continues about the Commonwealth devolving environmental responsibility to the states. Abolishing organisations like the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency, which has a vital role to play in monitoring standards across the nation, will only make achieving uniform standards that much more difficult.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        An argument is put that, so long as you have a national standard, it is really irrelevant whether the Commonwealth or the states do the monitoring and policing of that standard. This argument contends that, as long as a national standard is in place, the state environmental protection agencies can be responsible for the monitoring and the Commonwealth agency can be abolished. However, the experience in Victoria would suggest that there is a definite need for increased, rather than decreased, involvement of the Commonwealth in these matters.

         I was talking about the acts of the Victorian EPA. For example, about two years ago, a study of Melbourne's sewerage system was completed by the sewerage review project team of the environment group, Environment Victoria. It found that very little is actually known about the content of the hazardous waste that is being pumped into Melbourne's sewerage system. This was in part because the monitoring undertaken by the state authority, Melbourne Water, was claimed to be infrequent. Furthermore, the sewage was only tested to quite a limited range of traditional factors, like the pH level, and it neglected more harmful substances.

At a time when the government is attempting to berate the opposition by quite inappropriately and misleadingly linking the sale of one&amp;hyphen;third of Telstra to a commitment to the environment, there are currently some interesting reports appearing in the media.

         I note with interest and concern that funding for key programs dealing specifically with the area of hazardous wastes is set to run out at the end of the financial year. The programs affected include the national pollutant inventory, which would specifically force industry to give detailed information about types and amounts of hazardous waste that they create. As part of its `all things to all people' strategy before the last election, the coalition promised to maintain the existing environmental programs funded by the previous government. If these very substantial and worthwhile programs are allowed to be wound up because the government will not devote funds to them, that really exposes their true colours on environmental issues. Attempts to create some kind of false link between Telstra and the environment will not give the government any amount of credibility on environmental issues then.

My colleagues and I are part of that consensus. We had not agreed that this debate be continued past 1 p.m., and certainly not to 1.40 p.m. We had another speaker on this which would have meant we would run into question time. We have no intention, ever, of letting this continue close to question time because we have people who have other things that they have to do in the run&amp;hyphen;up to question time.
