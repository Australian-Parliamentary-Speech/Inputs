          —The report I table today follows the inquiry by the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts into the management of Australia's world heritage areas. The terms of reference for this inquiry focused the committee's attention on the management of existing world heritage areas. It did not require the committee to consider the relative merits of sites or the processes leading up to the nomination of new areas or cultural sites to the World Heritage List.

         Australia has 11 world heritage properties. They are scattered across Australia—only the ACT and Victoria have none. All of the properties were nominated for their outstanding natural values and some, such as Uluru and the Tasmanian Wilderness, were also nominated for their cultural values. In addition to being physically separated and diverse, the world heritage properties differ with respect to their management. Some of the properties, like the Northern Territory parks—Kakadu and Uluru—are managed by the Commonwealth. Others are the responsibility of the states, and yet others, like the Great Barrier Reef, have combined state and Commonwealth management systems.

        <para first-indent="16">
         While in many cases it is the states which manage the world heritage properties, it is the Commonwealth government that has the

The inquiry on which my committee is reporting today dealt with the extent of the Commonwealth's responsibilities for world heritage protection and also considered the adequacy of funding for the world heritage areas.

         Considerable controversy has been associated with the world heritage listing of many of Australia's world heritage areas. The Queensland and Tasmanian governments challenged the Commonwealth on listings in the High Court, and deep divisions have been created in many communities. It was therefore important for the committee to examine the effectiveness of the consultative arrangements that have been established for world heritage areas.

         All the witnesses to the inquiry were agreed that the World Heritage Convention confers on the Commonwealth responsibility for Australia's world heritage areas. There were, however, differences of opinion about the extent of the Commonwealth's responsibilities, as distinct from those of the states. The committee considered that it is the Commonwealth's prime responsibility to ensure that high standards of management are established and maintained in all world heritage areas. The committee identified a number of ways in which the Commonwealth should meet these responsibilities:

         In many of these areas, a good start has been made. However, it is important that the momentum so far achieved be maintained and new initiatives—like establishing systematic monitoring of all world heritage areas—be pursued.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The committee has also recommended that, in the future, issues such as the development of management plans and funding arrangements be determined before an area is nominated for the World Heritage List.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Funding is one of the critical issues for world heritage areas. Some sites, especially those administered by the Commonwealth, are reasonably well treated and some state managed areas receive sizeable additional funds from the Commonwealth. However, other state managed areas have received very little from the Commonwealth—for example, Fraser Island and Lord Howe Island. This is an inequitable situation which can only be resolved from the Commonwealth's viewpoint by distributing Commonwealth funds through a consistent approach based on the needs of the individual world heritage areas. It is important to stress, though, that the Commonwealth should not be regarded as a bottomless source of funds. The committee considered that the Commonwealth should only provide funds as a supplement to state funding, and state funding should continue at least at the level that existed before world heritage status was conferred.
        </para>
        <break page="6364" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         <para first-indent="16">
          In addition to Commonwealth funds being distributed inequitably, funding is insufficient to establish and maintain high standards of world heritage management. On the basis of the information available to the committee, it is estimated that an additional $20.6 million are needed immediately and then an additional $16 million per annum if world heritage areas are to be managed adequately. The Natural Heritage Trust is expected to make $12 million available to world heritage areas over four years; this is welcome but inadequate.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The committee noted that user charges, such as entry fees, have been introduced in many world heritage areas. It supported user charges as an appropriate way in which to supplement the funds available for world heritage management, provided that the revenue from such charges is returned as extra funding to the area from which it is collected and does not simply return to be added to consolidated revenue.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The committee considered that user charges should be more than a token amount and approved, in principle, the recent decision by the Commonwealth government to increase the environmental management charge on visitors to the Great Barrier Reef. The committee was very concerned, however, about the manner in which the recent increase in fees was introduced on an inequitable base, without consultation and without adequate lead time.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          The committee also noted the plethora of different charges applied by different levels of government in the Great Barrier Reef region, and recommended that the Commonwealth, with state cooperation, review these charges with a view to devising a more appropriate way of levying fees. With increasing pressures on world heritage areas and reduced funds with which to manage these pressures, there is a role for the private sector in providing works, services and infrastructure, though any private sector activity in world heritage areas will need to be very carefully controlled by government managing agencies.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          It is obviously preferable that the Commonwealth and state governments cooperate in protecting, conserving and presenting world
          <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
           heritage areas to the public, as the world heritage convention requires. However, if world heritage values are threatened and state governments fail to act to protect these values, the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act empowers the Commonwealth to intervene. While the use of this legislation has proved contentious, the committee considers that its retention is essential for the protection of world heritage values. The committee recommended that the legislation be strengthened, but did not agree with the suggestion that additional legislation should establish a general framework for world heritage management by the Commonwealth.
          </break>
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          There is other legislation that needs examination if we are to be sure that Australia is meeting its world heritage commitments—for example, the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. In addition, an overall review of the range of state and territory legislation would be useful to identify whether there are deficiencies. The committee also considered the legal aspects of administering the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, and in particular possible solutions to the problems that arise from the fact that the boundaries of the marine park and the world heritage area do not coincide.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Most of the recommendations in the report are of a general nature, referring to all world heritage areas. But there are a few recommendations which refer to specific areas—for example, the Great Barrier Reef, Fraser Island, the Riversleigh Fossil Mammal Site, Kakadu and Uluru. The committee was concerned about the ineffective community consultation on Fraser Island. It was also concerned by reports of poor relations between the then Australian Nature Conservation Agency and the Parks and Wildlife Commission of the Northern Territory, and recommended moves to improve the cooperation between the two agencies. I was pleased to note the very recent decision to have the Commonwealth's Director of National Parks and Wildlife and the Director of the Northern Territory's Parks and Wildlife Commission sit on one another's boards of management.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Overall, it appeared to the committee that much has been achieved through the listing of
          <break page="6365" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           Australia's world heritage areas. But it is also obvious that much remains to be done, some of it urgently. It is the committee's hope that the report I am tabling today will assist in the process of improving world heritage management.

          The report is the result of nearly two years of work by the present Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts and its predecessor in the last parliament. Most of the work of the inquiry was carried out by the previous committee under the chairmanship of Mr John Langmore, and it has fallen to the current committee to finish what was an almost completed task. I would like to acknowledge the work of Mr Langmore and all of the members of the committee, both past and present, who have contributed to this inquiry. I particularly would also thank the committee staff: Ian Dundas, Dr Sarah Hnatiuk, Susan Cardell, Marlene Lyons, and the many others who have assisted with this considerable work. This is a significant report and it certainly gives me very great pleasure, on behalf of the committee, to commend the report to the House.

          —Australia is privileged to have 11 of the world's 469 heritage sites. All of these sites are of such outstanding universal cultural or natural significance that, after a rigorous process of nomination and evaluation, they have been declared a world heritage area or monument. The inquiry, the report of which we are just tabling, found that Australia's management of world heritage sites has been uneven and often inadequate. Only three—Kakadu, Uluru-Kata Tjuta and the Tasmanian wilderness—could be described as well managed and just barely adequately funded; even in those, the rangers and attentive visitors would have no difficulty with suggesting improvements.

          In all the others there are some serious inadequacies in the structure or implementation of management and of funding. In all of them dedicated staff, with a sense of the significance of the task in which they are involved, are struggling to cope with insufficient political recognition, unresolved intergovernmental conflict, incomplete man agement structures, incomplete or poorly maintained infrastructure, inadequate funding and insufficient staff.

         These difficulties were readily apparent to the members of the environment committee. The seriousness of these inadequacies contributed to enabling the committee members to reach agreement about our report. I would like to express warm appreciation to the Chair, the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), and to other members for seeking and finding compromises which all members could support. Given the diversity of the membership of the committee, this is a significant achievement and must be recognised as adding weight to our recommendations and urgency to the importance of their implementation.

         Amongst the main recommendations are recognition of the urgency of complete management plans for those sites which do not yet have them and the crucial importance of building tourist infrastructure adequate to cope with all visitors and to give them a significant educative experience. This is both the best way of minimising damage and of ensuring that tourists' appreciation of the natural environment is enhanced by their visit.

          —The inquiry into the management arrangements of world heritage areas is  certainly very timely given the controversy of listing and general management problems associated with a number of world heritage listed areas. Because of the significant areas of world heritage listing in my electorate and their impact on the general community of Leichhardt, I was pleased to be able to play a small role in the formulation of this report.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Given that I have limited time to discuss the report, I will restrict my comments to what I see as some of the key recommendations. First of all, it was very evident that funding, with the exception of Uluru and Kakadu, was extremely inadequate. I was pleased to see we were able to recommend that significant funding be made available if we are going to maintain the integrity of these parks. We believe that the amount of $20.6 million should be provided and $16 million per annum thereafter. If we are going to set these areas aside as world heritage areas, then it is absolutely critical that funding be provided for them.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
          Another area in which I was pleased to see recommendations was community involvement. There were very strong recommendations to look at ensuring that local people are involved in the process right from the begin ning and all the way through. I think this is absolutely critical. We have seen incidences in my own electorate where the local community has been excluded from the process. As a consequence, there has been a tremendous amount of hostility and concern with regard to listings of world heritage areas and a lot of conflict within the community. With a little effort and significant involvement of the community you are going to suddenly have community ownership. I think that is very important.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We have also recognised the need for compensation for the loss of use of an area. I think this is another important recommendation given that once these areas are listed in some cases there are restrictions for the land-holders in what they can do. I think it is very important that we acknowledge the right for compensation for these people.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the previous speakers mentioned looking into a user pays system. I think it is absolutely critical given the controversy that we created through the increase in the environmental management charges with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park operators. I think we need to look at that sensibly to make sure that we are totally aware of the impact of that. Knowing that we have to move into a user pays system, it is absolutely critical we put this on the agenda and have a look at it over all the world heritage areas.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We also need to look very closely at defining the boundaries of world heritage areas. I think it is a mistake to have some form of agenda that we are going to take a quota of land. The land has to be determined on its world heritage values. When we are doing these assessments it may well be that there are additional amounts of land that can be taken. There may also be land that does not meet world heritage value and it should be excluded or removed from world heritage areas. These areas do cost a lot of money to maintain and it is important that money is spent in the right areas.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are a couple of recommendations though in which, while I support their general thrust, I believe we could have been much stronger. One of those is in regard to the Northern Territory government's involvement
         <break page="6367" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          in the world heritage areas of Kakadu and Uluru. I feel it is important they have a stronger involvement. I also believe that private enterprise, while it is great to see that we are looking to them to provide vital infrastructure, should also have a role in management. They have a lot of knowledge. We do have ANCA, which is the broader umbrella organisation—the watchdog so to speak—but I believe private enterprise could play a much greater role.

         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          governments—should provide an additional $20.6 million immediately and $16 million a year thereafter.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In that context, I would like to draw attention to the fact that, in this budget we have been debating in recent weeks, the world heritage budget in particular has been cut by 39 per cent. Some $16.3 million was previously allocated and that is down to $9.3 million. That is a very significant reduction in funding available for environmental protection of world heritage areas.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         When asked in the estimates committee how they thought the funding should be allocated for the various world heritage areas that are described in this report, the minister said that they needed to negotiate it with the states rather than look at some basis in need, as is indicated in recommendation 46, which says:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         That the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories, in consultation with world heritage area management authorities, identify and quantify specific additional funding needs in each of the world heritage areas as a basis for allocating the additional funds.
        </para>
        <para>
         While it is important to negotiate with the state governments, it is really also a question of identifying what needs to be done and how much funding needs to be spent in each area.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the difficulties when the Commonwealth government cuts funding, as it has in this budget, is that the states move very quickly to match those cuts. That has certainly happened in the case of the Queensland government. So you have a compounding effect of reductions in funding. For example, there were significant cuts to the Wet Tropics Management Authority budget, from $4.7 million to $2.8 million—a reduction which we understand will again be matched, unfortunately, by the Queensland government. So the funds available there, in a recently declared area, will make it extremely difficult to bring up to speed not only the conservation and protection of that area but also presentation to the public of that world heritage area. I think all members of the committee were very keen to ensure that it was not left to the privileged
         <break page="6368" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          few to have access to these areas but that it be managed carefully and appropriately funded.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I also draw attention to the fact that the government did make an explicit promise in their pre&amp;hyphen;election policy to provide, quite apart from the heritage trust, an additional $4 million to heritage management. Not only has that not been provided but, as I say, cuts have also been made. The Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, acknowledged in the estimates committee that managing world heritage areas is a major challenge—something that is clearly underlined by the committee report—and yet we have seen these reductions.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We have also seen some significant problems in relation to the approval of activities which may well diminish the world heritage values of very important areas. I draw attention in that respect to the committee's deliberations in recommendations 7 and 8 on the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. The committee recommends that the EP(IP) Act be amended to provide:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         a)
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          an environmental assessment be required where there is the possibility that a proposed action will damage the world heritage values of a listed world heritage area.
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para>
         I do not need to remind members of the controversy that has erupted over the approval for the Port Hinchinbrook resort. It has been against the advice of the government's world heritage unit and a raft of serious scientific concerns, yet there has been no provision for an assessment of the impact under the EP(IP) Act of this very significant development. Similarly, in relation to Kakadu we have very significant proposals yet to be properly fleshed out, both in relation to the environmental impact and the impact on the community.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
          Finally, something that I think the committee did not draw attention to was the fact that the government has changed its policy in relation to the listing of world heritage areas to require that in future they will proceed only with the agreement of the relevant state and territory governments. Given their reluctance to do that in the past, I think this means that the list we are dealing with at the mo ment may, in the foreseeable future, be the list and that we are not likely to see any further additions.

Indeed, I would like to acknowledge the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), who was the previous chairman of this committee. It is a shame that the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) is departing this chamber because there was bipartisan support to this inquiry. There was a lot of negotiation. Certainly the member for Fraser gave some very useful input, as did many of his colleagues. Regrettably, though, the member for Fremantle was not available for many of those dissertations.

         There are 11 world heritage parks, as was clearly mentioned by the previous speakers. We are very lucky in this country to have such a diversity both in cultural and physical attributes.

         The terms of reference of this inquiry were to look at the Commonwealth responsibility and its international and national obligations to look at the effectiveness of the consultative arrangements with relevant stakeholders and at the funding adequacy for management of those national parks.

        <para first-indent="16">
         There certainly has been a lot of controversy over the management of a number of these parks, but I am pleased to note that some of the recommendations in this report, I believe, will go to alleviating those concerns, particularly in relation to stakeholders, and encouraging the local community, particularly the indigenous people and the private sector, to have a role in the management plans. This was clearly demonstrated as a further need with some of the parks being managed in the Northern Territory. Certainly,
         <break page="6369" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         The other recommendations I would like to quickly brief the House on relate to the management plan and looking at a regular review—every five years—so that if there are changes in circumstances with land management and with the stakeholders they will be reviewed on a five&amp;hyphen;yearly basis, along with a redefinition of the plan. Other recommendations relate to looking at managing the impact, particularly from the tourism angle, looking at areas of sustainable usage and at encouraging further education, through persuasion and adequate addressing of permits, to allow a more flexible usage within those parks, for both the park proprietors and, of course, the public. That was also demonstrated as a need in Kakadu.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The role of the private sector was also looked at in the report. It is critical to have a greater interface between private enterprise, between those locals earning the income from or participating in those parks, and the role that the Commonwealth and states have with relevant agencies.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I noted that the member for Fremantle mentioned that funding was not an issue raised in our committee meetings. Indeed, there was much discussion, and that is why there was universal agreement that there needed to be an extra $16 million per annum going to the parks and also a one&amp;hyphen;off payment of $20 million. Obviously, a large section of this will come from our Natural Heritage Trust, which it is absolutely critical to get through this House, and part of it of course is going to maintaining, preserving and enhancing our world heritage parks.

         In conclusion, this report should be seen as a landmark report for the management of our world heritage parks—for better management and better structures and, obviously, to protect the very assets; and that is why they were listed by UNESCO. Obviously it is looking at areas in which to recover costs through user charges in a sensible way and to give ownership back to the local communities, particularly to the indigenous people.

         The Commonwealth government of course has the obligation under the various agreements that it has entered into, but, like much of our federal system, the success of our abilities to fulfil those obligations requires a great deal of cooperation between the federal government and the states and territories. Importantly, as other speakers on this report have said, doing the right thing by ensuring the preservation of world heritage listed areas not only requires the action of government but also requires the action of the community.

          of the controversy that we have seen in some of the areas would have been solved if, in fact, as we have recommended, management plans had been in place well before properties were nominated. The observation has been made that there must be not only a great deal of consultation with the communities concerned in the formulation of the management plans but that consultation must continue after the listing. If you look at the success of some of the arrangements to do with some of the properties, you will see that that success has been as a result of the continuing consultation with the various stakeholders that are involved.

         Other important recommendations go to funding.

That funding goes towards the requirement of important infrastructure—infrastructure required for visitors' amenities and infrastructure required for proper information through such things as signage and information centres—measures which will all protect the world heritage values themselves.

         The other aspect I should touch upon is that the Environment, Recreation and the Arts Committee of this House has had a tradition of producing documents on the basis of consensus. This is such a document. There were many areas in which listeners to this debate would have got the impression that there was a tinge of controversy. But, in the end, we have produced in a bipartisan way a report to which not only this government but also a new government—when there is a change of government, hopefully sooner rather than later—would be committed to on both sides of the chamber. That is a very important aspect of the way in which the environment committee has always operated.

But, in current circumstances, the committee has identified an immediate shortfall of $20.6 million next year and $16 million recurrent after that. We are also offering a solution through the increased use of private sector support and the increased use of user charges, where appropriate, for that funding shortfall.

         In successfully nominating areas for world heritage status, it is crucial that the Commonwealth and state governments work together, that the Commonwealth meet its financial obligations, that governments ensure that areas are managed and maintained in accordance with the needs of those areas and that management plans are both considered and thoughtful. Unfortunately, not all of these obligations have been met in the past. Amongst some of the findings, we have found

          that there are incomplete management plans for existing sites, at times there is poor monitoring of environmental risks, at times there are poor management structures and there is an underutilisation which seems to be consistent across the public sector of private sector support.

The report's recommendations, as stated in the summary, are `to build on the strengths and contribute to the establishment of better ways of managing world heritage'. As Australians, we must not take lightly our duties to shelter our natural environment.

This bill would place a legislative limit on the number of aircraft movements during any one&amp;hyphen;hour period at Kingsford Smith airport. This bill fulfils a promise I made during the election campaign—that is, to introduce it regardless of who formed a government.

        This bill sends a clear message to the people of Sydney: this parliament believes there is a limit to the capacity of Kingsford Smith airport. It also sends a clear message to those who oppose a second Sydney airport that this is not an option but a necessity. This clearly rebuffs those groups whose real agenda is to entrench Kingsford Smith airport as our only airport—an airport whose operations would destroy the lives of thousands of Sydney residents.

        Kingsford Smith airport is growing at a rate of over nine per cent per annum. For residents under the flight path this is alarming. At the moment, there are over 280,000 aircraft movements through KSA. Already the noise levels are intolerable for many. The decision to allow take&amp;hyphen;offs to the north from runway 34R without an EIS has significantly increased the capacity of the airport.

       <para first-indent="16">
        There are serious proposals to increase the number of flights to over 350,000 per annum as well as a proposal for a fourth runway. In addition, a bizarre coalition of the Greens, the No Aircraft Noise Party, the aviation industry and members of the Howard government, including the member for Hughes (Mrs Vale),

        He went on to say that the capacity would not be enough for the Olympics. Well, let the Olympic planners be put on notice. This bill would send a clear message to those who would excessively increase the capacity at KSA to the detriment of thousands of Sydney residents.

       <para first-indent="16">
        In addition to the increased aircraft noise, there is increased traffic from the airport through streets that were not designed to take it. There is also air pollution. Following sightings by a number of Marrickville residents, Airservices Australia have confirmed that, at 12.59 p.m. on 15 October this year, a US registered Evergreen Airlines aircraft dumped fuel over Marrickville. This occurs when tanks are overfilled or aircraft suddenly change altitude—and residents suffer. Mr Deputy Speaker, my point is quite simple: more aircraft movements equal more noise and more air pollution and a greater chance of a minor or major disaster over the most densely populated area of Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        However, it has to be said that there are many in the community who would have expected this measure to have been brought into legislation by now. The government took only 10 days to direct Airservices Australia to re&amp;hyphen;open the east&amp;hyphen;west runway. It seems bizarre that we are here eight months later waiting for them to legislate on one of their other key election promises—a cap on aircraft movements.

        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         commitment as a citizen of the Commonwealth of Australia into a pledge of loyalty to acknowledge the primacy of the interest of Australia and its people above all others. I am convinced that the present pledge of commitment given by all new citizens of Australia is now due for an overhaul. I think that Australia's existing citizens expect a firm promise by those who come here to join them as citizens of this great nation to be willing to give a clear and unambiguous commitment of loyalty where there can be no room for higher loyalties to other nations or people.

        Some people may ask, and there will no doubt be speakers today who will question, whether we need to change the pledge of commitment. Many people in this country do not even know what it says or who says it. It is a statement of commitment to be made at citizenship ceremonies and reads:

        This is a pretty piece of prose, but we should not forget its importance or what it symbolises. This is how people who are to become Australian citizens promise to uphold our laws and traditions. I think that we all should expect an unequivocal promise of loyalty and allegiance. The pledge as it now stands is not such a promise.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Let me tell you now that anything written as loosely as this pledge, more for its aesthetic appeal than anything else, can and will be interpreted differently by different people. Some individuals will take it to mean whatever they want. The pledge as it stands is a symbolic statement of motherhood principles and seems designed more to make us feel good than to make a real commitment. This is not a bad thing, but I believe that it is only a starting point.

        At any ceremony for granting of citizenship, you can see a number of migrants from a widely diverse background. They have decided to make Australia their home, and we have

         accepted them here. They will bring with them many fine things that will make Australia a better place, and I think that most will look back on this ceremony as one of the defining moments in their lives. To be asked to acknowledge the primacy of the interests of their new nation over all others should be no difficult task. I believe that most would expect it to be so. A strong pledge of loyalty and allegiance is also an important symbol to those who are already Australian citizens. At no stage should, or do I expect could, anyone fail to see the importance of the fact of changing one's nationality.

        I have been accused of wanting to prevent certain people from coming to this country as migrants. This accusation oversimplifies the situation and has allowed some to throw a neat label of `racist' at me. The simple fact is that the people of this nation have the right to choose who we want to join us—in fact, we have and will continue to do so as matters of government policy. Part of this choice involves making new citizens aware of what they are becoming.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It does, however, emphasise that what we have in our pledge must be clear and not open to interpretation in ways we do not intend. I believe that our pledge of commitment needs to become one of loyalty to Australia and its people above all others.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are at least two good reasons for this. Firstly, anyone coming into the country, being accepted as an Australian citizen, must take upon themselves a clear and unequivocal promise. There can be no misunderstanding, no room for error. They must accept their obligations without reservation or qualification. There can be no `core' or `non-core' promises here. Secondly, the people of Australia must see that new citizens are prepared to make that ultimate pledge. Exchanging allegiance from one's country of origin, with its history, values, laws and customs, to another is an important step. These people have chosen to do so and share our future. I have been accused of lacking detail or substance in what I have said on other occasions, so I will spell out my proposal here. I believe that the current pledge of commitment should

Loss or retention of former citizenship depends entirely on the laws of the person's former homeland. A Greek citizen remains a Greek citizen under Greek law and an American ceases to be an American citizen under American law when they become an Australian citizen, irrespective of what they say at our citizenship ceremonies. Countries like Canada, Cyprus, Egypt, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, New Zealand, Portugal, Switzerland, Turkey and the UK, to name but a few, allow dual citizenship. Others such as China, Malaysia and Vietnam do not. This must be of some relief to the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). But she should know that the Joint Standing Committee on Migration stated:

         —The member who has just spoken, the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), has quite clearly completely misunderstood the intent of this motion. This motion is to strengthen Australia's pledge of allegiance. I believe it is time that such a move is undertaken and this is made more important. I understand the government is to review the concept of citizenship. The irony of all this is that the majority of coalition members would support this motion if they were being consistent with their own policy document and discussions that have been held ad nauseam within the coalition's own backbench committees about the value of Australian citizenship.

        To be an Australian citizen is something to be valued. As a citizen who was not born here I can attest to that. It is no mistake that many hundreds of thousands of people want to come here every year. Those that are able to become Australian citizens guard their associated rights and privileges closely. The current pledge is one of commitment. The mover of the motion, the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), started to read it out. If we ask
        <break page="6376" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         ourselves what the origins of such pledges or oaths are, we find that allegiance comes from the old French `liege' meaning pure and absolute, with `liege homage' meaning unconditional.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This was developed in our culture from the English feudal system where unconditional allegiance was sworn to a sovereign. The four kinds of allegiance generally accepted are: natural allegiance, due from all people born in a domain; acquired allegiance, obtained by naturalisation; local allegiance, from aliens, so long as they remain in a domain; and legal allegiance, created by the oath of allegiance. I contend that these do not represent old and outdated concepts but, as a matter of security for the traditions, laws and institutions of a nation, the concept of allegiance remains just as valid in our society today.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Our society is in the midst of change and, generally, change for the good. We have a tolerant, liberal society that has grown in strength, value and diversity due to the contributions made not only by its own citizens but also by those new citizens who have come from all around the world to become Australians.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Anyone who comes to Australia with an expectation of becoming a citizen should be prepared to accept this country and its people, to the exclusion of all others if necessary. I believe that the Australian people would expect nothing less. As their representatives, we have an obligation to support their view. A step in this direction was taken in 1993 with the introduction of the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill, which introduced the previous oath with the current pledge and removed reference to a monarch. We know that at the time there was a great deal of debate over whether this was a precursor towards a republic. However, there is a view that this has generally been seen as a modern Australian approach.
       </para>

        The principal act—the Australian Citizenship Act 1948—requires anyone wanting to become a citizen to make an oath or affirmation of allegiance. This is a long&amp;hyphen;accepted and, I think, important condition that we have placed on all people wanting to become
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         citizens. If we are to continue to go to these lengths to pledge commitment to what Australia stands for and is, I think we are also bound by duty to ensure that the pledge actually means something real. The debate on citizenship cannot be undertaken separately from the debate on immigration and multiculturalism. In the previous government's own prescription of the bounds of multiculturalism, it noted:

I for one am extremely proud of my immigrant heritage. Since then the oath has changed on more than one occasion. It has undergone reviews and amendments. Despite these changes, members may be interested to know that entire sections of our immigrant community have not turned into racial, radical, anti-Australian revolutionaries simply because they used one formula of the oath rather than another. They have maintained their rock solid commitment to this country and the values we hold dear, while simultaneously maintaining a precious bond with a culture, a language and a religion of their past. This has been possible in Australia and we should all be proud of it.

        I am convinced that the motion put forward by the member for Oxley today is, above all, unnecessary. It pre&amp;hyphen;empts the work of the Australian Council on Citizenship, as announced by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) on 20 August. Our minister announced the process of reviewing comprehensively the issues of citizenship in Australia with a view to advising how best to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Australian citizenship on 26 January 1999. The council would deal with issues such as the meaning and value of citizenship; residency, language, age and other requirements; reviewing the current pledge; dual and multi&amp;hyphen;

         citizenship issues; and several other issues. The aim of the review will be to make citizenship more meaningful for all Australians, something which I fully support.

        With the centenary of Federation approaching fast, it is important that we openly examine the symbols and values which we as Australians see as important. There is always room for change and progress in this area, but it is just as important that these changes be undertaken in a mature and responsible way. The Australian Council on Citizenship will ensure that the concerns of all Australians, not some, are heard. This motion is just another example of opportunistic policy on the run.

        There is no political imperative to strengthen the oath of allegiance. To think otherwise is to imply that people simply swan into Australia, become citizens without even thinking about what they are doing and are somehow less committed than their Australian born counterparts. I point out that there are many countries in the Asian region—those countries which the member for Oxley believes are swamping us—which force its citizens to renounce their original citizenship once they become Australians. The member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) pointed out some of these countries, and I wish to repeat some of those. China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Brunei, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia and Nepal are some of the countries in this category. This would imply that people would not simply come to Australia and decide to become citizens lightly. They would do it because they believe it is the best thing for themselves, their family and their future, fully aware that there is no going back.

        I also reaffirm my belief that it is not the oath itself that makes us good Australians or this piece of paper which I am holding now, even though I am extremely proud of it, as most immigrants to this country would be.

         —I cannot do more than express my general agreement with the remarks of the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) and the member for Deakin (Mr Barresi). I think it is unfortunate that the member for Moore (Mr Filing) has associated himself with what I think was called in the newspaper this morning, and an accurate reflect of its motivation, `dog whistling'. That is saying something which has an ostensibly overt purpose but is intended to send subliminal tones to others that convey an entirely different message. That message is, as the member for Deakin has said, that some of our fellow citizens have not given a commitment to this country in a manner which we would expect when they become citizens of it.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Might I say that the Labor Party has no diffidence about defending the terms of the pledge of commitment as a citizen. In the term of our government we made an expressly Australian act of affirmation to become a citizen. We removed reference to a pledge of loyalty to Her Majesty. We made it clear that when somebody does become a citizen of this country they are pledging their commitment to this nation. I can do no better than refer to the words that former Senator Tate used when he was referring to its genesis through the words of Les Murray, with whom he consulted in developing this. He referred to it this way:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Then it says, `I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people'. This is the affirmative, positive act indicating a solemn commitment, an allegiance to Australia and its people. `Australia' is used there in a very simple expression but it has various levels of meaning. Obviously, there is the political entity, the Commonwealth of Australia. Loyalty is being expressed to that political entity, the name by which we are known amongst all the nations. But there is also a geographical and physical sense, which should not be totally discounted—the place. There is a commitment to Australia as the place where we are fortunate to be, the sunburnt country, the land abounding in nature's gifts of beauty rich and rare.
       </para>
       <para>
        He concluded by saying:
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para font-size="-=2">
         So the loyal commitment is meant to evoke obligations to Australian society, the political entity and the land itself, the place where we are.
        </para>
        <para>
         And it does that. No pledge can detail every particular of a citizen's ongoing obligations. But this demands of a person a commitment of loyalty to Australia and its people and a respect for Australia's democratic traditions. It says that those democratic traditions are to be shared, rights and liberties respected and laws obeyed and upheld.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         What could be more clear&amp;hyphen;cut? What could be more expressive of the obligations we expect of somebody joining the Australian community? What could be less properly characterised—as it has been this morning—as something which is merely a pretty piece of prose? This is something that is strongly Australian, but it is not jingoistic and it is not resentful of the fact that, when some amongst us come to Australia and take citizenship, they do not leave behind other of the sentiments that we would expect them to hold.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is true that to become a member of this place one must renounce all other citizenships. Perhaps that is appropriate for a member of the parliament but, notwithstanding that, there are members of this House, including the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), for example, who felt great unease in being placed in a position where he had to formally renounce his United Kingdom citizenship. There are many who have previously held dual citizenship and who feel that when they come to this place the constitutional obligation is one which places them in a situation which they ought not to be placed in.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is a matter which this House and the parliament will have to deal with in due course. But respecting the rights and entitlements of all of us who have made a commitment to this nation is a foundation stone for where we would wish to be. I do not believe that this House is in any way ready to accept the unspoken message of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson)—who was, I believe, unfortunately joined this morning by the member for Moore—that we do, in some sense, not demand of people coming to this nation a loyalty and commitment to Australia,

         —What sort of government would short&amp;hyphen;change pensioners in residential aged care? The Howard government would. What sort of government would be lousy enough to take $350 per annum from some of Australia's most needy and deserving citizens? The Howard government. When rental assistance was paid directly to age pensioners in residential care, they were able to retain 15 per cent of the assistance for cost&amp;hyphen;of&amp;hyphen;living expenses. Now the Howard government has ripped away this amount—approximately $7 each week—and bundled it into recurrent subsidies to cover the cost of administration in nursing homes and hostels.

        This is an appalling double standard and injustice. Why should other Australians, including age pensioners renting accommodation, receive rental assistance directly, while people in aged residential care are discriminated against? Four hundred residents in the Frank Whiddon Masonic Homes in my electorate are adversely affected by this change. I say to the government on their behalf, `Give them back their $7 a week for cost&amp;hyphen;of&amp;hyphen;living expenses, a very important amount for aged pensioners.'

Arrangements are already under way for the 1997 festival when it is planned to present a two&amp;hyphen;day festival incorporating a full military tattoo.

        It will provide additional income for charities and other needy bodies via donations from the proceeds of this function, as well as promoting a forum for commercial activities by Australian and British businessmen by incorporating a trade fair into Britfest. Further development of the Britfest concept will have great potential for business and employment growth in western Sydney as well as building on a successful Carnivale organised in August, so adding to the reputation of Blacktown as the multicultural capital of western Sydney.

         —For many years now the Shoalhaven has been sold short. All we seem to receive are promises in regard to the electrification of the railway lines through to Nowra. If it is really the intention of the state government that all share in the benefits of the Olympics, then the best way for the Shoalhaven to benefit in the short and long term is for this long&amp;hyphen;time commitment of rail electrification to be honoured. The benefits to the area both socially and economically could not be measured. With the expansion of HMAS

       <para first-indent="16">
        Having a modern rail service in the Shoalhaven can only prove to be an environmentally wise initiative by offsetting the road use on which this area depends. The transportation of goods and raw materials by road is often the only option for many Shoalhaven businesses and manufacturers. The opportunity to transport goods and raw materials by rail would be a very attractive alternative to negotiating some well&amp;hyphen;known road black spots.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As the second fastest growing area in New South Wales, an improved rail link would rapidly accelerate the tourism potential of what is already one of the major tourist destinations in Australia. Tourist attractions such as Jervis Bay, the Shoalhaven River, Kangaroo Valley and towns like Kiama, Gerringong, Nowra and, even further south, Ulladulla would have a much brighter economic and social future if an improved rail link to Nowra was realised.

       <para first-indent="16">
        For the residents of Shoalhaven, the electrification of the rail link to Nowra would mean that they would no longer be treated as second-class citizens. Direct access to the Olympics would be made simple and it would certainly be made easier for the elderly, the infirm and others to access specialist services.

        I had the opportunity a couple of months ago, accompanied by the Queensland Minister for Primary Industries and also by Mr Don McGauchie, the President of the National Farmers Federation, to visit one such area in outback Queensland near Winton.

        The problem is that, although many of these farms have now been out of drought declared areas since June of this year, the primary producers are not receiving any income. Their cash flow is absolutely negligible and under present arrangements it is quite unrealistic to contemplate that those people will lose the assistance they are now receiving come the early part of December. That is now only a little more than a month away. To take the assistance from those people, given what they experienced and what they continue to experience and the hardship they suffer, would be absolutely unreasonable.

        A couple of weeks ago I received a delegation led by the Queensland Premier, Mr Borbidge, which included representatives of industry. They put a case to me, which I found very compelling, for some change in the existing arrangements following the lifting of a drought declaration. As a result of those representations, the government has decided to extend, to a period of 12 months from the existing six months, the time within which the drought relief payments, currently restricted to only six months, can be paid. This is essentially a family support payment to help meet day&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;day living expenses.

         This is an entirely appropriate response to an ongoing area of very great need. The farmers of Australia over the last five years have suffered many things. They have been ravaged in many parts of our country by one of the worst droughts experienced for decades and this range of additional assistance measures is entirely appropriate. It is relevant. It is defensible. And I hope it is something that will draw the support of all members of the parliament.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The truth is that there are still many Australian farmers, although they have been out of drought now approaching a period of six months, who have no real prospect of a viable cash flow for some months into the future, and that is why the government has decided to double the period from six months to 12 months. It will not only apply to those people who have just come out of a drought declaration in June; it will apply in future to all people who have been in drought declared areas. Instead of having the assistance continue for a period of six months, that assistance will continue for a period of 12 months. It is estimated that these measures will cost over a full year an extra $81 million.

         —In answer to the honourable gentleman, can I say that one of the hallmarks of the coalition government will be an unswerving commitment to the role of small business in the Australian economy. It remains the case that, as we move towards the next century, more and more Australians will be employed by small business, fewer and fewer proportionately by large corporations and fewer and fewer by government instrumentalities. That is a trend that all Australians must understand and accept. It follows from that that all governments have an obligation—an absolute obligation—to create as welcoming a set of circumstances for small business as is consistent with the responsibility of governments to the employees of small business and to the consumers of the products and services of small business.

        That is the reason why I committed the coalition in the election campaign to the goal of reducing red tape by up to 50 per cent in our first term of office. To help achieve that goal, I appointed the Small Business Deregulation Task Force that was chaired by Mr Charlie Bell, managing director of McDonald's foods. On behalf of the government, I want to thank Mr Bell and the other members of his committee for delivering a first&amp;hyphen;class report, delivering it in a very readable, digestible form and delivering it well and truly on time. I can say in reply to the members of the task force that the government will give a comprehensive response to the recommendations of the task force by mid&amp;hyphen;February 1997.

        We have already implemented a large number of the commitments we made in the election campaign. We have reduced the provisional tax uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent. That is worth $160 million a year—let me say again: $160 million a year of extra cash flow injected into the

        In the Treasurer's budget we foreshadowed legislation that will come into effect on 1 July next year that will provide capital gains tax rollover relief to the tune of $200 million. This will fulfil an election undertaking made by the coalition. It will be of direct and very considerable benefit to the small business sector of Australia. We have legislated, and we await the passage of the legislation in the Senate.

        Now that an arrangement has been reached with the Australian Democrats, the Labor Party almost alone will remain opposed to freeing the small business sector of Australia from the unfair dismissal laws. I want to say that again: every time a small business man or woman complains about the unfair dismissal laws that actually discourage thousands of small businesses around Australia from taking on more staff, there is only one group of people they have to blame—and that is the men and women of the Australian Labor Party. It is the men and women of the Australian Labor Party who were responsible, without a mandate, without warning, without any electoral authority, for introducing the unfair dismissal law, a law described even by the sole remaining Labor Premier in Australia, Bob Carr, as a law that is destroying the job opportunities of young Australians. Nowhere is that happening more intentionally than in the small business sector of the Australian economy.

        The report of the Bell committee made a number of sweeping recommendations about the operation of the fringe benefits tax. The terms of reference of the committee were that consideration should take place on the basis of revenue neutrality so far as recommendations were concerned, but there is little doubt that the complexity of the fringe benefits tax is one of the main complaints of small business wherever you go in Australia.

        There is a recommendation that government agencies should develop a single registration form for small businesses, that the Australian Taxation Office develop a single registration form for all taxes, to allow employers to issue all group certificates at the end of the year unless required by an employee, to extend the voluntary payment system for provisional tax to ease the cash flow burden on small businesses. I have already taken action to place small business deregulation on the agenda for the meeting of the Council of Australian Governments to take place in November.

Affordability is at its highest since the Commonwealth Bank&amp;hyphen;Housing Industry Association index began in late 1984. That is the delivery to the Australian family of housing affordability at the best rate since they started taking this index in late 1984. There is no better benefit that can be delivered to the home buyers of Australia than lower interest rates, particularly to those families which struggled under the punitive interest rates of the failed Keating regime when the failed Keating regime took housing interest rates to 17 per cent and business rates to 21 and 22 per cent.

        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         increase in housing affordability in the September quarter. Housing affordability has been increasing over the last year and this is the biggest quarterly rise since March 1992 when interest rates fell by one percentage point to 12 per cent. All of the variables that affect affordability are working in the same direction.

        The loan repayment needed on a typical first home mortgage fell from 20.7 per cent of household income in the June quarter 1996 to 18.9 per cent in the September quarter. The level of housing affordability is one factor, together with the unwinding of stocks, which points to a recovery in the house building industry starting next year. These are direct benefits to the Australia home buyer.

        I would also take this opportunity to point out that margins—that is, the margin for banks between the interest paid to depositors and the interest rate charged to borrowers—have been traditionally high in Australia and there are opportunities for those margins to still fall further.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We saw earlier this year that the major banks were, as a result of aggressive competition in the home mortgage market and as a result of competitive pressures, able to reduce the variable home loan rate by 0.75 per cent in advance of a cut in official interest rates. That proves the benefits of competition, and the benefits of aggressive competition for mortgage originators, who have now taken their rates below eight per cent, also puts the pressure on banks to see if they can compress those margins further in relation to the variable mortgage rate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As far as the government is concerned, it is competition which will drive the compression of those margins. It is competition which will deliver those kinds of benefits to borrowers. It is sound economic policy which has made housing affordability so great for the average Australian family. This is the delivery of the program that the coalition holds dear—to families and to children in relation to mortgage rates. This is the way in which average Australian families will see the benefits of good economic policy.

Firstly, the Prime Minister and I received a very comprehensive report by the Small Business Deregulation Task Force, a report that contains 62 recommendations with regard to the red tape burden imposed on small business.

        In relation to credit card rates, it is important that competitive factors be unleashed in relation to them as well. Just as competitive factors have reduced bank margins, competitive factors will reduce credit card margins. Interest rates for credit cards of banks with no interest free period range from 12.75 per cent to 17.95 per cent. So there is obviously room for competition in there. Credit cards with an interest free period range from 15.5 per cent to 18.95 per cent, the majority having an annual fee ranging from $15 to $35. You will

Firstly, they are referred to the Private Health Insurance Advisory Council for its advice as to whether or not the premiums are required for statutory solvency levels. In some cases, my department has approached funds and asked for additional information, asked for figures to be reworked or, particularly, asked

          to clarify assumptions under which some of the calculations have been made.

        To date, no applications have been disallowed because all the premium increases have been justified on the basis of the funds' requirement to maintain solvency levels under the law. However, I am making it very clear to the funds that there is no more rubber stamping of premium increases. The public is not expecting that premium increases will never go up, but it does expect the health funds to act responsibly with full reference to the environment in which they operate. I am taking these expectations into account before considering premium increase proposals. I would also remind the honourable member that the previous government over a period of 13 years allowed 174 premium increases and knocked back none whatsoever, and that was about one premium increase per fund per year. So that rubber stamping has certainly stopped.

So the legislation is properly enabling as opposed to being proscriptive.

        It is worth noting that, contrary to the claims of some of the critics of the bill, the needs of women and young people and the role of the unions are also addressed. The principal object, amongst other things, includes ensuring freedom of association and democratic, accountable and effective trade unions and employer organisations.

         The one which I dubbed the Howard object is the object which encourages the parties at work to allow employees to better balance their work and family responsibilities. There has been such a big social change in our country in the last 20 or 30 years. It is a great shame that in the last 13 years those who have wanted to better balance those responsibilities have been denied that opportunity. The last and interesting point to make is that, whilst we put up what I think are very sen sible and practical objects to the proposed legislation, the Labor Party has been opposing them at absolutely every turn.

        Even that proposition was assented to by your current leader when he was minister for employment and the former Prime Minister when he was both Prime Minister and Treasurer and it has been assented to by leading political figures on both sides of politics over a long period of time. If you really want to destroy jobs in this country, you first destroy the country's creditworthiness, and that is what the former government was doing by running up such a large volume of debt. It was not until the new government came into office and we tackled the problem of both the national debt and, through it, the overseas debt that we put down a strategy which, in the medium to longer term, will be a strategy for dealing with that.

The fact is that you agreed with our strategy, and if we had adopted the strategy that is implicit in the question, if we had adopted the advice that is now so freely given to us, the outlook for unemployment in this country would be very, very bad indeed, because you cannot build employment on fiscal profligacy. You cannot build employment by allowing a budget to career out of control.

        Let me make a few comments about Aboriginal health. The first is that the budget, overall, is very positive for Aboriginal health. The Aboriginal health specific budget was not subject to any savings; in fact, the efficiency dividend is being ploughed back into new Aboriginal health services. There are 200 Aboriginal communities in Australia without any access to health whatsoever, even the
        <break page="6396" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         most basic nursing post. We will be able to address 35 of these communities' needs because of decisions in the budget.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We have also allowed Aboriginal medical services to have access to Medicare billing. Not all did. This provides an income stream that many of them did not have. We announced funding for the third national HIV-AIDS strategy. This will run from 1997 to the year 2000. Within that, Aboriginal sexual health will be taking a greater priority. I have had discussions with organisations interested in HIV-AIDS matters. They accept that it is time that Aboriginal people got a greater access to this funding.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There are a number of other initiatives that will specifically benefit Aboriginal people. The diabetes action plan that we promised before the election will be implemented. It will affect Aboriginal people because they have a particularly high rate of diabetes. We are trying to get GP and specialist services into rural and remote areas. We committed $215 million to that in the budget. That will help Aboriginal people. We have a joint initiative with the AMA, which is very well progressed, to try to get specialist services into rural and remote areas.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I would not want to see Aboriginal health just in terms of money, because we would be making the mistakes of the past if we thought that was all it was. One thing I have been working very hard on is framework agreements with state and territory governments. I was able to announce to the House a couple of months ago that we had signed the first one with South Australia. I have now signed five such agreements, with South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales, the ACT and Queensland, the last being on Friday with Victoria. I am confident that we will soon have every state and territory in the country signing these agreements. Of themselves they are not going to make a dramatic difference, but they are an important building block to make sure that two things happen. The first is that all tiers of government are trying to work in a coordinated manner. The second thing is that we bring Aboriginal medical services and ATSIC in around the table as part of the joint planning process so that never again do we
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         get the overlap and duplication that have bedevilled this area.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I would say to the honourable member that the task is still immense, that honourable members should reflect that in 1996 there are still 380 Aboriginal communities with no access to running water and there are still 200 Aboriginal communities with no access to a health service, no matter how rudimentary. The task is not an easy one. It has had many overblown hopes before. It is certainly not something I want to do. I would say to the honourable member for Dobell and to any other member of this House that if they have serious ideas as to how we can do more and how we can make a greater impact, I make the offer that I am very keen to hear from them. I would be happy to make my department available. In the end, this is something in which, if we can all work together in a slow, hard slog, we might make some improvement over time.

With the exception of the Northern Territory, and subject to final confirmation from one jurisdiction, all state and territory Attorneys-General endorsed a legislative scheme for the transfer of prisoners. This endorsement paves the way for participation in transfer of prisoner schemes with other countries. Such schemes have significant humanitarian, economic and social advantages.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Once enacted, the proposed legislation will allow Australians serving prison sentences overseas and foreign nationals serving prison sentences in Australian prisons to return to their home countries to complete their sentences. Before any prisoner transfers can take place, this legislation will have to pass through the federal parliament and through the relevant state and territory parliaments. A number of administrative steps will also need to be taken, and transfer agreements will have to be made with other countries. We will be working to have the scheme operating as quickly as possible, and to that end I intend to introduce the Commonwealth legislation in the near future. I expect the participating states and the ACT will enact complementary legislation promptly.

        The honourable member for Cook also asked about Thailand. The conclusion of a prisoner transfer agreement with Thailand has been a high priority because of the comparatively high number of Australian prisoners in Thai prisons. Thai and Australian officials conducted preliminary discussions on this matter in April this year. The endorsement of the legislative scheme at the recent SCAG meeting will enable the commencement of more substantive negotiations. Any agreement reached with Thailand will not be able to enter into force until Australia's legislation—that is, the Commonwealth, states and ACT

        I have also been advised that, if the windows were allowed to be opened, because of the design of the centralised airconditioning system in the building, this would lead to the discomfort of others in rooms adjacent to the room with the window open and substantially increase the energy costs for Parliament House. To provide more information on this matter, I have asked the Joint House Department to issue a circular to building occupants on the building's airconditioning system. If individuals still have concerns, the circular contains contact points where inquiries can be made and, if necessary, investigations ordered.

        —The Deputy Leader of the House (Mr McGauran) appeared to be under something of a misapprehension when he said this matter had been the subject of discussion and agreement with the opposition.

       In the circumstances, may I state shortly that our position is that we would be deeply unhappy at anything which curtailed question time taking its full, normal and natural course and that, while there may or may not be a case for stopping the parliament briefly while the rest of the country has stopped for the running of the race, our view would be that a half&amp;hyphen;hour adjournment was unnecessary, particularly if it were to cut into what would otherwise be the scope of question time and given the pressures allegedly upon the business of this House. We believe there is a need for some further discussion between the Leader of the House (Mr Reith), the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) and others, and we hope this can be the subject of further report back later this day.

        I am speaking again today on Badgerys Creek because I refuse to let the issue slip quietly away into the night.

         services and welfare. When we have time, we also worry about the spectre of an international airport operating at Badgerys Creek. The people of western Sydney are deeply concerned about Badgerys Creek, and similarly with Holsworthy. After the third runway debacle at Kingsford Smith, they view any talk of EISs with a thoroughly jaundiced eye.

        Government assurances of environmental safety, whether they be from a Labor or a coalition government, are seen as admissions from the powers that be that they know something is wrong. It is cynical, but true: this is the reality as I find it in western Sydney. When the decision was made to build Sydney's second airport at Badgerys Creek in 1985, a few people, like me, raised their voices seeking answers to what troubled us most about the development. That number has only grown larger over the years.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We were wary of what toll such an airport would take on our lifestyles and on our family's lifestyles. However, we were informed by the authorities that nothing would go wrong at Badgerys Creek and that all the relevant steps would be taken so that the airport's environmental and social impact on our communities would be kept to a minimum. The Kingsford Smith third runway debacle did nothing to alleviate our fears, nor did it instil in us any confidence in what the authorities were telling us. In western Sydney we felt from both sides of politics a genuine lack of understanding of the way people were feeling in Sydney's west about Badgerys Creek.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Over the same time it became apparent that Sydney's capacity for absorbing air and water pollution had reached its limit. Asthma rates were up in Sydney's west. Scientific models show how the air pollution of the entire city travels west each day, settling on our heads causing the health problems we know about and heaven knows what else we do not know about.

        The people of western Sydney know in their hearts that a fully&amp;hyphen;fledged international airport of the kind now being envisaged by the coalition—360,000&amp;hyphen;plus flight movements and 13 million passengers per year—can never operate on their doorstep without
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         devastating social and environmental effects. They felt the same way about an airport of the magnitude suggested by the Labor government when it was in power—270,000 flight movements per year. They know this to be the case whether the airport is situated at either Badgerys Creek or Holsworthy. The question now is: what can be done to make those in control of the decision making process sit up and take notice of our fears and concerns?

        The coalition came to power promising to listen to the people of Australia. They spent the entire campaign in Lindsay talking about how they were a government which listened to the people of western Sydney. Yet the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the member for Hume (Mr Sharp), is not listening to the people of my community and the people from the western Sydney area who are saying, `No, we don't want an international airport built next door to us. No, we don't want to have jumbo jets screaming over our homes 24 hours a day.'
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If he were listening, he would be acting. If the member for Hume and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) really wanted to listen to the people and if they really wanted to act in the best interests of the voters from the west, they would swallow their pride and take a serious look at what other opportunities there are in relation to Sydney's second airport.

        The idea of building an international airport at Goulburn seemed ludicrous in 1985. To put forward the notion of constructing Sydney's second airport close to two hours drive away with little or no transport infrastructure to support it would have been to invite ridicule but, over the last 11 years, the story has changed somewhat. Spiralling pollution levels in the Sydney basin combined with our burgeoning population should signal to any sane individual that the time for building an international airport within 50 kilometres of Sydney's city centre has passed. We missed the opportunity 10 years ago and there is no chance that we can reclaim it now.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The story has changed in that we now also have the prospect of the very fast train link going into operation between Sydney and Canberra some time in the near future, which
        <break page="6407" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         could be easily routed to run through Goulburn. That would negate the strongest argument against that town being chosen as the general site for Sydney's second airport. That argument at the time was its distance from Sydney.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Whichever fast train option is decided upon—be it Speedrail's TGV model or Transrapid's Maglev train—we are looking at a transport system which would cut down the travelling time between Sydney and Goulburn to 45 minutes. Forty&amp;hyphen;five minutes is the time it presently takes to travel from London's Heathrow Airport to that city's centre on the tube—a journey made by thousands of people every day, day in and day out, and hundreds of thousands a year without any hiccups whatsoever. Forty&amp;hyphen;five minutes is less time than it would take an individual to travel on City Rail from Badgerys Creek to the centre of Sydney—we have not got a line there at the moment. It takes more than 45 minutes for my constituents to travel from my electorate office in Fairfield to the Sydney CBD.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Distance and travelling time from an airport at Goulburn to Sydney is therefore no longer an issue with the operation of the very fast train. In the process, the argument against Goulburn being at least considered—and that is what I am asking for, consideration—as a site fades into the ether, and that is what we should be on about.

        That people can still continue to be so short-sighted and single-minded as to insist that either Badgerys Creek or Holsworthy are reasonable options for an international airport faced with what information we have is not only frustrating but downright dangerous.

        An airport at Goulburn would mean jobs, infrastructure and economic development for the people of the Southern Highlands, just as the very fast train would mean the same. If the government can consider Holsworthy, one of the least attractive options in the original 1985 EIS, when faced with the information we now have and faced with the population and pollution problems that besiege us now in Sydney, then surely it can show enough judgment to carry out another EIS into the Goulburn site—an EIS based on the premise that the very fast train service will be in operation by the time the airport is finally built.

         —The underlying intention of the motion moved by the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) is, without doubt, to limit Sydney to the one international airport—that is, KSA—which will soon be approaching maximum capacity. I am astonished that the honourable member for Prospect was able to get this motion through her caucus. At least I am assuming that she got the motion through caucus. If she has done it without caucus approval, then I expect all her Labor colleagues whose electorates are currently noise affected to publicly dissociate themselves from this motion. If not, then I will make sure that their constituents know of their acquiescence to this motion that is intended to limit Sydney to one international airport.

        If it is the case that the honourable member put this forward without caucus approval, I would expect the ALP members whose electorates are noise affected to rebuke their colleague the honourable member for Prospect as part of their contribution to this debate. No matter whether the former or the latter is the case, the fact is that the Labor members on the other side will definitely have to be into each other about this motion. It will be a very interesting half hour indeed.

        It is important that this parliament notes, once again, the fact that half a million Sydney residents, if not more, are being subjected to intolerable levels of aircraft noise and pollution because of the prevarication for more than 10 years by the former Labor government in getting on with the task of building a new international airport.

The land at Badgerys Creek has now been purchased and Badgerys Creek remains the government's preferred site subject to a satisfactory EIS. The land at Holsworthy is Commonwealth property and the government has actioned a parallel EIS for Holsworthy in the event that the EIS for Badgerys Creek proves to be unsatisfactory for whatever reason. Both EISs will be transparent and in keeping with the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise.

        The honourable member for Prospect seems to be claiming an expertise in the issue of picking a suitable airport site or, at the very least, she knew or she should have known that Goulburn was considered in 1985 with nine other sites but was quickly rejected as unsuitable for several reasons, not the least of which was its great distance from Sydney.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The honourable member mentions in a motion that a very fast train service will solve the distance problems to Sydney. What she does not say is that the cost of the VFT is in the vicinity of $2&amp;half; billion—that is $2,500 million. On top of all that, she says absolutely nothing of the cost involved for that return trip from Sydney to Goulburn—in the vicinity of $170 per person return. A family of three will have to pay more than $500 to see someone off and to come back to Sydney.

        Additionally, the honourable member knew or should have known the fact, as was stated when Goulburn was looked at as a possible site, that the Goulburn area is fogbound for 50 days of the year. In other words, if there is to be an international airport—which just will not happen in Goulburn—she will be restricting the use of Goulburn airport by one-seventh of the year because it is fogbound.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The fact is that, if Goulburn were picked, it would quickly fall into disuse. The airlines just will not go there, for all the reasons that I have mentioned. That will cause a tremendous pressure to fall on Sydney airport which has a cap now of 80 movements a hour. The pressure will be such that a government, no matter what government, will have to consider lifting the cap, otherwise Sydney airport will just close down. How many movements an hour at Sydney airport does the honourable member for Prospect want—80, 100, 120,

        The fact is that, if Goulburn were to be picked as the second international airport, the pressure of these delays on Sydney airport—if it were to be considered, after which no doubt it will be rejected—will force Sydney airport into being a 24&amp;hyphen;hour airport, otherwise we in Sydney will not be able to cope. That is just unacceptable to the residents of Sydney. The honourable member for Prospect has not thought through the implications of her motion. I am certain that members of both sides of the House will treat this motion with the disdain it deserves.

And the big losers are unquestionably the half a million people affected by aircraft noise in Sydney. We have had a number of instances where the ALP has sacrificed people in the Sydney basin for their greater factional battles. There has been no issue more significant—

         It is as logical to build an airport at Goulburn as it is to build an airport on Deimos—a moon that circumnavigates Mars.

That is a pipeline that goes from Kurnell to provide the avgas that is going to run the considerable number of planes that will be running out of a second international airport. Every jumbo requires 14 tankers of avgas. How are you going to do that? Put it on a very fast train?

        At this point I think it is appropriate to allude to Australia's involvement in the Gulf War. We committed Royal Australian Navy warships and supply vessels to the gulf in 1990. We openly condemned the invasion of Kuwait and the taking of hostages by the Iraqis. Following the liberation of Kuwait, Australian Defence Force personnel took part in mines disposal and Australian companies contributed to the postwar reconstruction of Kuwait.

Only this month—again, 5&amp;half; years after the Iraqis were forced to retreat from the sovereign nation of Kuwait—Iraq has told the UN that economic sanctions threaten its society with a horrendous disaster that may lead to its collapse and has accused the United States of attempting genocide. In a memorandum to UN Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Iraq claimed that the economic sanctions which ban the export of all and import of most goods except food, medicine and humanitarian items were part of a US plot to cripple Iraq. The memorandum states:

While we are on congratulations, I would also like to send congratulations to a very good friend of the association and a good friend of mine, Sheikh Salem, who, after the recent elections in Kuwait, has now taken up the high office of Deputy Prime Minister and defence minister in Kuwait. At the same time, he has retained his chairmanship of the Missing Persons Bureau, an appointment he has held since the end of the Kuwaiti war because of his interest and at the great expense, of course, of other important government positions. He has come back into the government again but retained his position as chairman. For those of you who might not know, he has devoted all of his time to travelling the world convincing people of the disaster that was Kuwait five or six years ago. He has discussed this subject in the UN and every other forum that he has been able to get access to.

        It may not seem a big thing when you say `just over 600 people'—I have pointed this out to the parliament before—but if you equate 600 people to a very small national population of just over half a million people, you would soon deduce that nearly every home in Kuwait has been affected by the atrocious behaviour of Saddam Hussein. We are talking about missing people. I know this subject is not about me, but I remember during the war when one of my uncles went missing. I always remember my old Irish grandmother was in a terrible state, and the fact that he was missing was more of a blow to her and caused more anguish in the family than the fact that nobody was aware of what became of him. It is the same with these people.

        Iraq is playing a silly war of nerves with Kuwait at the present time.

        The fact is that even as recently as 16 October 1996, at a meeting in Geneva regarding the missing people of the Kuwaiti war, the Iraqi delegation did not know anything. This is the stock answer that they keep giving. So it is confusion all round.

I took the opportunity to advise them on the up-to-date situation in Kuwait and pleaded with them, while they were in New York, to lobby anybody that was in easy reach of them and to inform them of Australia's point of view. I also asked them to point out to anybody who might lobby for Saddam Hussein Iraq's responsibilities in conforming to the UN resolutions that have been passed on him over the past four years.

I certainly commend them both for their action in this matter. Most of the world deplored the actions of the government in Baghdad for its 1990 act of aggression against Kuwait, and having visited Kuwait after its liberation I was still amazed at the wilful destruction that had taken place. It is a credit to the government of Kuwait that, in a short space of time, it has been able to restore most of the damage that was done and thus enable its citizens to continue their lives as they would wish, even allowing for the continuing threat of the regime in Iraq.

         As I said in December 1994 following a visit to Kuwait, it is important that Australia, as a middle order democracy, continues to join other nations of the world in seeking the release of those Kuwaiti detainees. While ever since their capture the Iraqis have denied the existence of those prisoners, there is a strong rumour that in talks between Iraq and Jordan comments have been made by the Iraqis that would indicate they admit to having Kuwaiti prisoners. How much information has been conveyed in these discussions is uncertain, but at least it gives some hope that the Iraqis are now prepared to talk about the existence of the prisoners. Possibly in the near future negotiations may be instigated, even if they are through a broker like the Jordanian government, to have them released at an early date.

        If I may, I will make an observation: not quite five years ago we were in this chamber for two days debating Australia's involvement in the Gulf War.

        Also, we were faced with the prospect that, for the first time in a major conflict, there could have been the use of chemical weapons. I am sure that played on the minds of a lot of members when they debated the matter at that time. Here we are five years or so later speaking on the same matter to all intents and purposes and still seeing the continued aggression against the people of Kuwait by Saddam Hussein and the government of Iraq.

        I particularly wish to condemn the flagrant violations of human rights by the government of Iraq, which is continuing to illegally hold hundreds of Kuwaiti citizens as prisoners of war since its abortive invasion in 1990. It has been over four years since the conclusion of the military operations in the land and air campaign in the Gulf War, and we do well to question what we have achieved.

        There are, however, some negative effects that arise and may grow so that they diminish all the positive elements achieved in the Gulf War unless they are addressed. The first thing is that Saddam Hussein continues to threaten his neighbours, including Kuwait, despite international condemnation and sanctions. This must constitute the greatest failure of the pre-war, war and post-war policies of not only the United States but also all the allies. The Iraqi nuclear, chemical and biological arsenal has not been destroyed and, by some accounts, continues to grow. It remains a significant threat, not just to the region but to all nations on this planet.

        Iraq continues to hold an estimated 625 prisoners of war, taken during its abortive invasion. Iraq does this despite international condemnation and sanctions. As has been indicated by the member for Fowler on other occasions, the number of prisoners is a substantial tragedy for Kuwait. On a per capita basis, it would be equivalent to 15,000 Australian, 50,000 British or 220,000 American citizens being held by Iraq. I cannot emphasise enough the enormity of this tragedy to a small nation like Kuwait.

        Australia played a very important role in the international efforts to reclaim Kuwait. It is a role of which we can be justifiably proud.

        We must recognise that, unless we are able to carry this issue with Kuwait and Iraq through to its proper conclusion, we will indirectly contribute to the ongoing tragedy.

The car industry is at the core of Australia's manufacturing activity. It is a driver for other key manufacturing industries, such as glass, chemicals, plastics and steel.

        The importance of the automotive industry to Geelong cannot be understated. Geelong's largest private employer, Ford, employs 2,800 people at its Geelong operation, and its suppliers employ a further 1,000. According to Ford's submission to the Productivity Commission, its work force generates $136.5 million in wages and salaries to the local economy, and the automotive sector accounts for 25 per cent of manufacturing employment in Geelong.

To put it simply, the closure of Ford would have a devastating effect on all private businesses in Geelong and would create an industrial wasteland that would stifle economic development of the region for the next two decades.

        When the federal government announced the Button plan in 1984, it set out several objectives for the industry. One major objective was to increase efficiency across the industry to enable it to compete with imports and in the international marketplace at lower levels of government assistance. Another was to provide better quality cars to consumers at lower prices. These objectives were to be achieved by a combination of gradual tariff reductions, better economies of scale through rationalisation, and productivity and quality improvements through massive investments in new technology and human resources. Today the overall success of the Button plan in achieving these objectives is not in dispute. However, that success has not come without considerable cost.

        The industry has registered significant increases in productivity. For example, by 1995 labour productivity in car manufacturing was 47 per cent higher than in 1988. The quality of Australian cars has improved dramatically, and efficiency gains have enabled Australian manufacturers to compete successfully in key car categories. Two important car manufacturers—Ford and GMH—have returned to profitability after several difficult years, with all four manufacturers committing investments of around $2 billion in new models and plant upgrades. In addition, exports from the car and components industry have increased from around $383 million in 1984 to over $1.7 billion today, with the most promising increases coming from the car components industry, reflecting price and quality improvements all the way down the supply chain.

        Despite these advances, there has been a significant drop in employment in the car and

This falling local output has been accompanied by increased import penetration of the Australian market, to the point where imported vehicles now make up 50 per cent of the passenger car market and nearly 100 per cent of the commercial vehicle market.

        Today the Australian car manufacturing industry faces a unique set of challenges, having come through a period of restructuring, and having cemented its place as an efficient producer of quality products in our extremely competitive global trading environment.

       <para first-indent="16">
        However, at this point in its manufacturing history, the industry finds that its future does not just lie in its own internal capacity to become more efficient and productive. Its future will be shaped by the further globalisation of the industry along with Australia's trade liberalisation commitments and by the car industry assistance arrangements that will be set in place for the industry beyond 2000 by the Australian government.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is these industry assistance arrangements that I wish to address in this House today. The Howard government must make a strong commitment to the preservation of a viable car and component manufacturing industry in Australia. Fortunately, the electoral defeat of the Liberal Party in the 1993 election forced upon the current government an abandonment of its near zero tariff policy and an acceptance of a base level of tariff assistance of 15 per cent by the year 2000.

Firstly, the globalisation of Australia's car industry means that critical investment decisions on its future are made by international car companies in a global context. They must be sent a clear signal by the Australian government that it wants a car and component manufacturing presence in Australia. Secondly, it is clear that the long-term survival of the industry is linked to the expanding of its export capacity, and that is inextricably linked to gaining access to new markets, particularly in Asia. The international trading environment of the Australian car industry will be increasingly hostile in the future.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Many of our Asian and APEC trading partners have both tariff and extensive non-tariff mechanisms in place to protect their automotive industries and to foster further industry development. For example, Malaysia imposes tariff levels of up to 200 per cent, Indonesia 100 per cent, South Africa 61 per cent and India 50 per cent, while Taiwan imposes a ban on vehicle imports from Australia. Our traditional trading partners in western Europe and the USA have voluntary trade restraint agreements with their major trading partner, Japan.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Indeed, if every other country in the world provides some degree of assistance to support their car industry as a core manufacturing industry, why should Australia be any different? To successfully retain a viable car industry presence in Australia, the government must provide an industry assistance regime that will stimulate market demand for locally produced cars in the short term and expand exports so that the production of Australian cars can return to historically viable levels.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It would be naive of me to suggest that a Liberal government, wedded still to Fightback and Thatcher experiments in industry policy, would alter the current phase&amp;hyphen;down of tariff levels to 15 per cent by the year 2000. But it should call a halt to any further tariff reductions at 15 per cent by 2000 and link any further tariff cuts to substantial actual reductions in tariff and non-tariff barriers by our

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        To create a viable domestic market, the government needs to lower current taxes and charges, such as sales tax, to effectively stimulate demand for Australian cars and to seek ways of overcoming the old age of the Australian car park. The government must also provide appropriate support for the industry's efforts to export and restore its incentives to invest and engage in research and development.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is clear that the industry's great success in recent years has been due to the massive skilling of its work force, the development of a new workplace culture and the application of advanced manufacturing technologies. The government must make sure that this process continues and that management is included in the skilling process. It must ensure that the current export facilitation scheme continues.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This industry's future does not lie in the zero tariff rhetoric of Fightback or in an obsessive preoccupation with micro&amp;hyphen;economic reform and labour market deregulation to guarantee its future. The great gains of this industry have been achieved by redefining the workplace culture and in extensive cooperation between management and progressive unions. Its future lies in a practical realistic framework of industry assistance that continues enterprise improvement, builds upon the great skills of the work force and provides a secure level of tariff protection which sends the signal to car companies that they are welcome in Australia's manufacturing environment.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If this industry were to close down, it would cause a loss of direct employment in the car and components industry of around 22,000 with devastating consequences for key manufacturing regions such as Geelong, and it would cause a massive blow-out of the automotive trade deficit to $11 billion at a time when the government is making great play of the necessity to reduce the nation's current account deficit.

         Geelong's car industry with a clear, unequivocal commitment to the preservation of car manufacturing in our city.

It is clear that if that policy had prevailed in 1993 Ford would not have made the $1 billion investment in its Australian operations in 1995 and Geelong would not have a car manufacturing facility. If he does not, all of Geelong will know that the spots on the Corangamite leopard have not changed since 1993.

         —My grievance today is with the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), who has unleashed in our nation a debate which is on the one hand laudable and on the other abominable. I will make clear the differentiation between the two in my remarks today. Of the many issues she has raised, I wish to address in my brief time, firstly, multicultural and Aboriginal affairs and, secondly, immigration. Let me say at the outset that I believe deeply and passionately in the philosophical concept of freedom of speech.

        Among those basic rights which I hold dear to the foundation of a democratic society are freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of assembly and freedom of religion. Foremost among those is freedom of speech, for if the state or others take from us our inherent right to express freely our views, our opinions, our thoughts and even our prejudices we become a society of oppression where the views of the many are dictated by the few. Woodrow Wilson once said:

        While I champion the right of free men and women to assemble, join and practise whatever religion they will and speak openly and freely, it is important to recognise that those freedoms come with a price, which is responsibility. If our speaking would hurt or harm others, then we must learn to moderate our speaking in support of a cohesive and tolerant society.

        I am told by a learned friend that witches can dance around raindrops. But rather than viewing that dance as a marvellous ability which they did not possess, men and women, through fear and ignorance, burned witches at the stake. While we now live in more enlightened times, it seems we still have need to guard against fear, ignorance and intolerance where such attitudes bring hurt to others.

        In reflecting on the community debate in Australia today following some overly publicised comments by the member for Oxley, I think we are having two debates. The first, which is about race, creed, culture and religion—in fact, difference—seems to me to be through lack of tolerance based on fear and lack of understanding. The second is, I think, a genuine intellectual debate about, firstly, how best to help those of us who from whatever circumstances cannot or will not without community help lift themselves from positions of deprivation and, secondly, the level, but not the composition of, immigration.

       <para>
        Our nation of Australia was, of course, conceived at a different time and in different circumstances, but we have never been any less committed to the democratic concept that all men, and indeed all women, are created equal. Lincoln's question was answered in the affirmative.

        The member for Oxley has said that a truly multicultural country can never be strong or united. She has also said:

        I believe we are in danger of being swamped by Asians.
       </para>

        I think the member for Oxley is just plain wrong. Our nation is a nation of immigrants, even including, tens of thousands of years ago, our Aboriginal citizens. I am an immigrant, as are many of my colleagues who are representatives of the people in this House of Representatives.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I believe that Australia has become one of the greatest melting pots, if not the greatest, of the world's humanity and that we have done it better than any other nation on earth. We have managed to bring together cultures, creeds and ethnicities from all points of the globe without the racial and religious intolerance and hatred leading to violence and physical acts of desecration which are so prevalent in so many other and older societies in both the developed and the developing world. Any debate which denies that fact is just plain wrong.

        I can understand that many in our community feel insecurity because of change to the largest extent forced on us by a rapidly changing world—change we can no more ignore than we could walk to the moon. Too high levels of unemployment help feed that insecurity. But immigration has built this nation and immigration has provided jobs, not taken them away. Fear of difference and fear by individuals of being unable to control events outside themselves always make it easy to blame others for our particular circumstances. But fearing people who look different, speak differently or dress differently is addressed by education and tolerance, not bigotry or racism. I have said before in this

        On the second of my major issues today, I think the member for Oxley has kicked along a debate we are starting to have, which I have described as an intellectual debate, on how best to help those in our society who today we term `disadvantaged'. It is a reasoned and rational debate which has surrounded modern concepts of the welfare state for a very long time. In recent years it has become all too frequently the habit of those who believe in an ever expanding safety net to denigrate those of differing views as heartless, unthinking, racist or lacking in sympathy and understanding. It is a political correctness argument. In my view it is intellectually sustainable to argue that increasing social welfare can lead to increasing dependence and that dependence breeds upon itself, locking those encompassed by it into a life void of happiness, ambition or fulfilment because of that dependence. The member for Oxley has said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The majority of Aboriginals do not want handouts because they realise welfare is killing them.
       </para>
       <para>
        I suspect that is not true. I believe that we have a compelling need to help our Aboriginal brothers and sisters lift themselves through effective education, urgent attention to demonstrably poor health outcomes and dramatically improving their access to an acceptable standard of housing. It is not only appropriate but also incumbent on us to do everything possible to help those in our society who are in need and to give them a chance to help themselves. How we go about this is a legitimate debate.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But to argue that Aboriginals, particularly those in regional and outback Australia, are not the most disadvantaged of our citizens is an absolute nonsense. The member for Oxley has said:

        At first glance, that sounds like the ultimate national motherhood statement, but if it is code that we must all be the same to meet that objective, then the honourable member misses the boat well and truly. We will never be all the same. Trying to put us into boxes defined by race, creed, colour, hairstyle or dress is both impractical and undesirable. It is our differences that make us learn, think, expand and grow—and that, my colleagues, is for the good of us all. Mark Twain said:

        We are increasingly aware of the internationalisation of economies, trade and values, and of the globalisation of companies and businesses. Almost daily the communication revolution ensures that we watch events live, whether it be elections or debates or whether it be major catastrophes like those in Zaire or in other parts of the world. In that process there has been a tendency for people to become more tribalised. This has been spoken about to some degree, but it is perhaps less understood. It has become more and more difficult for people to relate closely to each other in large numbers. We are seeing the breaking up of nations in the USSR and in Yugoslavia. We are seeing a move toward smaller units and smaller groups, to identification for self&amp;hyphen;awareness. That is understandable and it is human, but it carries with it a great

In that context it is quite predictable that people may seek to appeal to the simplistic and to the emotive. That is what we have been seeing in the last year or more. There has been an increasing appeal to prejudice.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Prejudice has always been around and it always will be. It is a part of human nature. It is based on fear, insecurity, paranoia, very often ignorance and, of course, the matter of self&amp;hyphen;doubt, particularly at national levels. Prejudice in my youth was about the then incoming waves of migrants, about religion, about where people lived and about what state you came from. We see it being expressed in football games in all ways and in all forms. We must not pretend that it is something new. It has been used by politicians and leaders of all kinds since man was man. The previous speaker, the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), spoke about the demagoguery of the Nazi regime and its appeal to prejudice.

        We understand that prejudice is there and we understand what it means. We also understood, or thought we did, that civilisation and social cohesion were predominantly about understanding our prejudices and recognising them for what they are, and about respecting the fact that one person's prejudice is another person's offence or insult. We understood that recognising and refraining from expressing our prejudices in the more extreme forms was a part of being civilised. It was a part of being educated. It was a part of recognising our individual acceptance of some sense of social norm, social mores and social cohesion.

That is a very limp excuse and a very limp explanation of a much more serious matter. The idea of labelling it with some new trendy label does not solve the problem and does not answer the question. I think the efforts of the Prime

         —I will tell you how if you also interject afterwards. For the Prime Minister to suggest that people should be free to speak and then, after they have spoken, to say, `There's an example or a demonstration of free speech,' effectively means that he is condoning the insulting of those who are insulted, the offending of those who are offended and the enraging of those who are enraged. That is what he has done, and he has done it very carefully and very precisely. That is why, in his opening remarks in that same article, Mr Robinson said:

        Throughout that article Mr Robinson points out that this is actually avoiding the issue. The idea that the answer is that somehow it will be forgotten is not the answer, because it needs to be challenged head&amp;hyphen;on, not in terms of censoring people and not in terms of saying people can't talk but in terms of saying that social cohesion and social responsibility mean that we accept and recognise our prejudices and that we recognise the harm they can do others.

       <para first-indent="16">
        What we are seeing is a licence to vilify, a licence to offend and a licence to insult under the guise of freedom of speech. Freedom of speech has never had such licences attached to it. It has always been there for those who want to do it. There has never been a legal restraint on those who want to act in that way, and nor should there be. But there always has been a social recognition that that causes other problems. Effectively, what we are talking about is social anarchy.

       <para first-indent="16">
        As a country we often hear about law and order. We do not often talk about the boundaries of black letter law or law in terms of social mores and social standards, which in many ways is the more important law, the more important judgment. What we are seeing now is an expression of anarchy by not just some parliamentarians but by the Prime

         Minister as well, in condoning that. There are those who think you can restrict expressions of prejudice simply to matters of race, religion or culture. No, you can't. We will be seeing similar expressions of prejudice to older people, to people with disabilities, to all kinds of people who are different in any way, because prejudice is basically about difference.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The condoning of this so&amp;hyphen;called freedom of speech and this so&amp;hyphen;called debate is actually an encouragement to those who will seek to express their prejudices as and when they wish—and to hell with the consequences. Those consequences are widespread and profound. The fact is that we have been hearing some examples, particularly in the first speech of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), about the supposed special help and special programs that some people get. I presume that also means special programs for pensioners, based on age. I suppose we also have special programs for people with diabetes, people who cannot read and write or people with particular medical problems. All those special programs should obviously go, because in the context of a program based on a special need—whether it be a disadvantage, language inability or age—where do you stop? Where do you draw the line? Once you start that approach—and that approach has already started—where do you stop? I suggest that what we are seeing is leading to a serious breakdown of our social standards.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This should and does concern all of us. We are seeing now that suddenly there is a concern because it may affect the economy. The fact is that that has always been there and we have always known that, if we insult people often enough, eventually, if they can, they will shift their business. More importantly, the trade between countries is undertaken by people of goodwill, between people who speak the languages and know the cultures. If they are the ones who are being insulted, then the people at the forefront of trade are the ones who are being wounded and damaged.

        The more important concerns should be the concerns about our society and its make&amp;hyphen;up—the questions of respect, recognition of each other's differences and the acceptance of the

         benefit of that. I had an example just the other day—I am sure we are all getting phone calls now—of a mother of Asian extraction whose son came home one day and said to her, `Mum, at school they asked me today why I don't go back to where I came from. What did they mean, Mum?'

         —I want to bring to the attention of the House the shameful situation that the coalition government inherited from Labor after 13 years of neglect of the rural and regional areas of Australia. In particular, I want to highlight a report, recently released by the Liberal Party's regional and rural committee, entitled
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Striking a Balance
         </emphasis>
         . This shows that over 13 years, from 1983 to 1996, Labor effectively completely left out of the policy process many parts of the services to regional and rural Australia. This report is the voice of the country. It is the voice of the anger of the people, not only in my electorate of Wannon but also right throughout regional Australia. I think it shows just why there was such a huge swing in so many parts of the country against the Labor Party on 2 March. It demonstrates that over 13 years the Labor Party really had very little interest in the concerns of people in the country.

       <para first-indent="16">
        In the time available, I want to quickly go through a number of areas which highlight just how serious this neglect really was by the Labor Party. We start by looking at unemployment. Many people are aware how serious the problems of unemployment have been in the country. Not only is there a limited variety of occupations available in the country but also, in many cases, there just simply weren't any jobs. In fact, while we are all well aware that unemployment, particularly amongst our young, exceeded one in four, higher than 25 per cent—in fact, in many cases as high as one in three could not find work—we find in some parts of Victoria that it went even higher. For example, in western Victoria it climbed to 36 per cent, while in the Mallee it climbed as high as a staggering 66 per cent of our young unable to find work, at one stage, under the Labor administration.
        <break page="6425" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         These are only the official figures. Often they hide an even more serious situation.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second area I would like to highlight today is health. Many people think the country is a nice, healthy place to live. In some ways, the lifestyle is very healthy. But, unfortunately, when you look at some of the statistics, we find a very different picture. For example, heart disease in the country is up to 18 per cent higher than it is in the city; strokes are up to 29 per cent more prevalent than they are in the city; pneumonia or influenza can be as high as 95 per cent higher than in the city; and the incidence of traffic accidents can be up to 61 per cent higher. I could go on.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Rural children are now far more prone to ailments than those in the city. The death rate for rural girls is 15 per cent higher than in the city, while rural youth suicide, which is one of the great tragedies that has crept up on us, is now the highest of any Western society. Despite this, one would have thought that the availability of services might at least have been shared, but in figures which I got from the former Labor minister for health we found that people in the country, on average each year, get between $100 and $200 less in Medicare rebates than those in the city. This could be up to 30 per cent lower. In other words, the availability of services in the country is such that people just do not have access like those in the city.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
         You might say, `What did Labor do about it?' I cannot say they did absolutely nothing. In the past four years we saw the national rural health conference, we saw the national rural health alliance and we saw the national rural heath strategy, and the Australian Rural Health Institution was set up to study the program—just form another committee. Despite all this, the Department of Human Services and Health had stated simply what the problem was, that is, that country Australia needs another 300 to 500 GPs. What you might say is that Labor might have been seen as the government of perpetual announcements and really, when it came to health, the government of perpetual inaction. We ought to contrast those examples with some of the work that is already being done by the coali tion government, when we see the work that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has already undertaken in the setting up of a number of private health initiatives.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The third area I want to touch on is education, something we all know is so important for our young in this current age. It gives them the means to get ahead. But if you look at what is happening in the country, the sad fact is that, as a percentage, fewer country students are completing secondary education and even fewer are going on to tertiary education. It is really very disturbing to find that rural retention rates for year 12 have seen country students fall behind their city cousins, with a rate of 52 per cent compared with 66 per cent. If you look at those going on to tertiary education, you find that the number of country students is actually falling, down from 25 per cent in 1989 to just 16 per cent last year. This means they are 60 per cent less likely than city students to undertake tertiary education.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Despite these chilling figures, despite what was so obvious, we saw a government that continued to refuse to even face up to what is basically one of the major causes of the problem and that is that it costs more to get education for country students than it does for city students. Yet they failed to address this in any meaningful way. The statistics show very clearly just how seriously they failed that test.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The fourth area I want to touch on is transport. To see what has led to the growing disparity between the city and the country, you only have to look at what Labor did to transport costs. What better example is there to show this than the change in fuel excise which increased a staggering fivefold under Labor. Yet at the same time the amount of money that the federal government was spending on roads under Labor fell from $850 million to $840 million over that period. At the same time the amount of fuel excise collected by the Commonwealth rose from $3,000 million to a staggering $10,000 million.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The fifth area I want to touch on is drought. Nothing shows more clearly the stark contrast
        <break page="6426" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         between the coalition government and Labor in the response, the understanding and the concern for people who suffer horrendous costs and losses and suffer personally as the result of drought. We saw an example in Victoria where in 1992 many farmers had their entire crops wiped out by flood only to find that just over a year later they faced drought. But, according to some little formula that Labor had concocted, they did not qualify for any drought assistance even though they had suffered such devastating losses. If you look at the criteria Labor was applying in the 1967&amp;hyphen;68 drought and in the 1982&amp;hyphen;1983 drought, nobody in Australia would have qualified for any drought assistance. I want to contrast that with the announcement the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) made today. He showed that the coalition government really does have an understanding of drought, not only while an area is drought declared but also in the subsequent period with the costs and the difficulties that people have in getting back on their feet.

       <para first-indent="16">
        There are a number of other areas that I would like to touch on but given the limited time available I would like to come back to the key point that I think 13 years of Labor neglect of the country has created a devastating situation and it has left rural Australia very much the poorer. Professor Lindsay Falvey from Melbourne University put it very eloquently when he said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The image of rural Australia and in particular agriculture and related industries in Australia has been neglected and in some cases denigrated amongst the city base where electoral power largely rests. It is a responsibility of Government that all Australians be made aware of the benefit of strong agricultural, food, horticultural, forest and related industries to the well being of all Australians in economic and lifestyle terms. Similarly, the image of agricultural and similar industries and those working in them needs to be updated significantly so that the diverse skills in terms of environmental and use of appropriate high technology are appreciated.
       </para>
       <para>
        Hear, hear, I say to Professor Falvey. And I think it was the  Labor Party more than anyone else that set about to downgrade that image of rural Australia. So the report that the Liberal Party's committee put together,
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Striking a Balance
        </emphasis>
        , not only outlines these
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         problems but also looks at some of the initial solutions that the coalition government has already put in place. But the coalition's commitment to rural Australia has again been reinforced by the release of our Budget document,
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Rebuilding regional Australia
         </emphasis>
         , which shows that clearly we are starting down that track. But the election itself highlights just how much the electorate woke up to what was happening in Labor and if you look at the regional and rural seats today Labor holds just five whereas the coalition parties hold 49. That shows clearly how disillusioned rural Australia was with Labor.

         —I rise to enter this grievance debate to grieve not merely as the member for Melbourne Ports, a genuinely multicultural community, but as a former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and a former Minister for Immigration. I rise to condemn the semi&amp;hyphen;illiterate, prejudiced and biased statements of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). I believe there has been a level of tolerance extended to that member which belies the kind of nonsense which she has perpetrated in this House and which I believe is doing great damage to the nature of our Australian community. There is no minister for immigration or ex&amp;hyphen;minister for immigration who will not tell the Australian people that it is always the last group of migrants getting off the boat that cop the flak. It has always been thus.

        One only has to look at the history of immigration immediately after the war to see the way in which the late Arthur Calwell, the founder of our immigration policies, was subject to abuse, vilification, turgid comments and cartoons. Why? Because he brought to Australia people of Jewish religion, many of whom were holocaust victims. That criticism of Calwell came not simply from the more conservative sections of Australian society but also from people who have had former associations with the Labor Party.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So there has always been this problem in Australian society. I thought we had overgrown it until I heard the member for Oxley condemning people because they have their own culture and religion. So what! Which

        She also says they form ghettos. If you visit any community in Melbourne, you will find areas where Italians, Greeks, Chinese and Vietnamese have settled. Why? Because, if you are arriving as an immigrant without much wealth, you will seek out cheap housing and, if you do not speak fluent English, a neighbourhood which is sympathetic and, hopefully, contains some of your fellow former countrymen. You will seek their views and their advice. You will seek to live near the place of your religion and hope that you will also find a place to educate your children.

       <para first-indent="16">
        That is the history of the major centres of Melbourne and it is a history which up until now has produced, I think, one of the most remarkable multicultural societies to be found anywhere in the world. I, for one, am not prepared to sit and listen to the kind of nonsense talked by the honourable member for Oxley, who is long on rhetoric and long on slander but short on detail and chooses to use what she describes as fact without any real basis at all.

       <para first-indent="16">
        She wants to abolish ATSIC. I have heard that argument before. She is the only member of this parliament or of any parliament—and I have been in two—who has said they will not represent people in their electorate on the basis of their ethnicity, and she is referring to our indigenous Australian people. I have always operated on the basis that, after an election, it does not matter how many votes you win or lose, as a member of this parliament, you represent all of your constituents. If the chairman of the local Liberal Party is having difficulty with his bureaucracy and he is one of my constituents, he has a basic right to have me argue for him and do my best for him. That is a view that I believe runs through this parliament as part of our tradition.

       <para first-indent="16">
        When I hear the member for Oxley read out a speech written for her—usually she cannot get through it without making all sorts of mistakes—and say that there is one section of people that she will not represent, I condemn her. She does not understand the workings of
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         our parliament. She does not understand the policy that has been formulated and administered by ministers for immigration over the years of different political complexion.

        There are plenty of things to argue about in immigration. All ministers have had to face the question of how you balance the immigration intake, how you deal with that in economic terms and how you deal with it in terms of regional capacities to absorb people. That has engendered many important debates in this place and so it will continue to do.

       <para first-indent="16">
        But there is no significant contribution to this debate coming from the member for Oxley—oh, no! She could have been here when a very important motion was passed by this House, but she chose to absent herself because she had business in Melbourne. If she feels as deeply as she obviously does and if she is wanting to express a view on a debate of that kind, one would have understood if she had absented herself from any previous engagement to be here to put her point of view. But that is not her methodology.

        She chooses carefully where she will make her statements and she does that under the privilege of parliament. She will not be interviewed by the ABC—no reason given—and she will only go to select audiences. Let me say quite frankly to this House: if you want to run a racist agenda and if you want to run an exercise in vilification of certain groups in this community, there are organised groups in Australia which will be only too happy to provide you with an audience. I find it no accident that she has now been adopted by the League of Rights. Why would she not be?

        She says all she wants is equality for all Australians. From the very birth of this nation, all Australians were not equal and they are not equal. No government can legislate to produce some kind of odd equality. What does she want? She has claimed John Howard, the leader of the political party that disendorsed her, as her leader. He will do her. I sympathise with the Prime Minister on that matter. There is not much he can do about it.

         If she says she still wants to debate this matter, then, I for one, as a former minister, will meet her anywhere in Australia at a time and place of her choosing—and I believe there will be other members of this House who will do the same—because you cannot let this argument run on.

        This is not just a question of damaging our economy.

But more important than the economic damage, let us get this right: it is a question of national morality; it is a question of how we see ourselves as a people; it is a question of saying, `The one thing we will not abandon'—and it has not been abandoned by any minister for immigration—`is that, irrespective of your colour, irrespective of your religious beliefs, irrespective of your background, you will face a test, which is a uniform test, for whatever class or category you choose to enter Australia. You will not be told that, because of the colour of your skin or your religious beliefs, you will not be accepted.'

        Mr Mann, due to a series of circumstances, brought proceedings in the High Court, London, against a former employee of his, Mr John Eccott; a journalist, Dianne Fernyhough; and a medical journal, called

        , for publishing a defamatory article. Mr Mann was successful in the case and, due to the defendants' apparent protraction of the argument, his costs were substantial—over £900,000 accumulating over a period of some 10 years or more.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The case came about because Mr Mann was made aware of the defamatory article in a London journal. In the process of seeking to defend himself, he pursued his opponent in the British courts. In order to gain information for the case being brought by the Medical Defence Union, who supported Dr Eccott's litigation, that union employed a solicitor, a Mr Rubinstein. Mr Rubinstein, solicitor for the union and other defendants, I believe, may have misused confidential information which he obtained through Commonwealth and state government departments.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        On a visit to Australia, Mr Rubinstein was able to gain access to the department of health in New South Wales and the departments of health and immigration and ethnic affairs in Australia. Over a period of time I have seen freedom of information copies of file notes and comments by departmental officers. From those, it is patently clear that there was an understanding in the public service that Mr Rubinstein was acting on a matter of highest principle and had the support of the then Solicitor-General in making his inquiries here in Australia. He was provided with a range of documents, files and statements from state and Commonwealth records—documents, files and statements
        <break page="6429" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         which were of a confidential nature and should never have been supplied to an outsider.

        Mr Rubinstein, after being supplied with this information, then proceeded to go back to Britain to prosecute Mr Christopher Mann using the documents that he had obtained here in Australia. These documents, when produced in court, were used by Mr Rubinstein to prove, or attempt to prove, to the court that Mr Mann had not conducted himself in the best manner and that he was regarded as a person of some doubt by Australian authorities. When asked in the London court to produce all of his documentation, Mr Mann was not able to produce the documents which had been obtained by Mr Rubinstein.

       <para first-indent="16">
        It seems strange to me that we have an instance where an Australian citizen, born and bred, is not able to obtain from the bureaucracy documentation about their own records and behaviour, but that a foreigner coming into Australia on a visit, by using officers and contacts, is able to gain complete files which he then takes overseas and uses to prosecute that Australian citizen. When these matters were first raised with me by Mr Mann, I did not believe that Australian government departments would be party to such a process. But I am absolutely certain that they have been and, whether inadvertently or by design, they have supplied documentation that allowed Mr Mann to be prosecuted to the extent that he has lost his own home, the home of his mother and that of his mother-in-law. He is now enjoying very poor health, due to the great physical strain he has had to undergo over the last 10 or so years.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For a normal individual to pursue these matters a lot of money is needed and the court costs are extreme. Mr Mann long ago ran out of the capacity to pay for QCs and barristers and has in fact been basically successful in pursuing this matter himself. He has become extremely well read in the law. He is an intelligent man and he is able to pursue these matters himself. He has had to do so if he is intent on restoring his good name.

        The former Attorney-General acknowledged these facts, as do the current office holders, but says that the case of Mr Mann was not affected by the Commonwealth's release of confidential information because that confidential information had already been made available by a similar process by public servants in New South Wales. So we have had two lots of public administrators saying that they were not to blame—the administration in New South Wales blaming the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth blaming New South Wales. In this process we have a man who has been done a grave injustice in my opinion.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Mr Mann, as I have said, has suffered greatly. It would not be such a serious matter if the London courts had not found Mr Mann right in all his claims and awarded him costs of £900,000. It would not be so serious if Mr Mann could not go through the taxing process of that £900,000 because he cannot afford to. It would not be so serious if there were other public servants, other than Commonwealth public servants, involved in this process.

         —I grieve for the double standards of the coalition parties. I grieve for the way in which they talk about most issues in code—that is, stating policy for the consumption of one audience but then adding a qualification to satisfy the prejudices of another audience. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is the best example of this code of doublespeak.

        The Prime Minister claims to be sympathetic to the cause of Aboriginal people but not by learning any of the lessons of their history. He claims to be sympathetic to cultural diversity in Australia, yet he talks the language of one monocultural Australia. He claims to have taken a stand in the race debate, yet perhaps he alone in our nation refuses to mention Pauline Hanson by name. He claims the priority for Australia's future in the Asia-Pacific, yet he declares our closest bonds to be with Britain. He claims to be a micro reformer, yet he is only interested in reforming the labour market, not product markets. He claims to be an economic reformer yet also a social conservative, as if the two come from different planets and can never collide.

       <para first-indent="16">
        None of this doublespeak makes for national leadership. It only makes for confusion and drift—the type of confusion many Australians now feel about the race debate and our national identity; the type of drift now being felt on employment policy, the nation's economic growth and our place in Asian markets. Confusion and drift—the hallmark of Howard leadership then and now. Confusion and drift—the defining features of the Howard government.

        It is not just the Prime Minister. The full extent of coalition doublespeak is revealed in the publication the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Australian candidate study
        </emphasis>
        released just last week. This was a survey of the views of candidates who stood at the last federal election conducted by academics from three universities. It is a reliable, candid and quite stunning insight into the world view of
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         the coalition's candidates, most of whom now sit in the House of Representatives. It reveals the full extent of the coalition's doublespeak—the conflict between its public policies and private prejudices.

        Let me run the House through the key findings of the study, which I shall also seek leave to incorporate in
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Hansard
        </emphasis>
        . I will provide six instances in this study of coalition doublespeak. The first instance of doublespeak relates to multiculturalism. The public policy of the coalition is support for cultural diversity and racial tolerance in Australia. The private prejudice revealed in this study is that 35 per cent of the 115 coalition candidates surveyed believed that Australia had gone too far in giving equal opportunities for migrants.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second instance of doublespeak relates to the rights of women. The public policy of the coalition—and their female members use this in the House quite frequently—is support for the rights of women and active female participation in our society. Yet in the anonymous survey distributed to each of the coalition candidates who stood at the last election 33 per cent of the 117 respondents believed that Australia had gone too far in providing equal opportunities for women.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Even worse, 40 per cent of the coalition's candidates, two&amp;hyphen;fifths of their membership, disagreed with the proposition that government should increase opportunities for women in business and industries. That is hardly a radical proposition; and hardly a statement of attitude which accords with a party which says that it believes in equal rights for women.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The third instance of doublespeak relates to Aboriginal Australians. The public policy of the coalition was that governments need to improve the living standards and opportunities of Aboriginal people in Australia. Yet the private prejudice revealed in this survey is that 54 per cent of coalition candidates believed that governments had gone too far in helping Aboriginal people. More than half of the candidates who stood for the coalition at the last election believed that governments had gone too far in trying to help Aboriginal people.
       </para>
       <break page="6431" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The fourth instance of doublespeak is on relations with Asia. The coalition's public policy, stated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) and the Prime Minister, is that the coalition gives priority to a relationship of trust and cooperation with our Asian neighbours. The private prejudice revealed in this study was a stunning finding: 61 per cent of coalition candidates believed that China is likely to pose a threat to Australia's security. Even more amazing, even more out of step with their public pronouncements, is that an even higher number, 76 per cent of coalition candidates, believed that Indonesia, Australia's closest neighbour, is likely to pose a security threat to our nation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The fifth instance of doublespeak is on trade policy. The public policy of the coalition was a belief in an open economy and a free trade agenda for the Asia Pacific. Just today, there was quite an excellent article by the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Australian Financial Review
         </emphasis>
         echoing that attachment to free trade. Yet the private prejudice of coalition members and candidates is that 49 per cent, almost half, of the 114 coalition candidates surveyed agreed with the proposition that `Australia should limit the import of foreign products in order to protect its national economy'. No wonder the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) is wincing. No wonder he is trying to hide from these quite stunning and revealing survey results telling us so much about the private prejudices of the coalition.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It gets even worse. The sixth instance of coalition doublespeak—indeed, the mother of all doublespeak—was on help for battlers. The public policy of the coalition was that they would spill blood to try and assist the so-called Howard battlers. Yet there was an interesting response to the question in the survey conducted just a few months ago: would candidates agree with the proposition that income and wealth should be redistributed towards ordinary working people?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One would have thought that a party, the coalition, that declares so much support for battlers would readily agree with the proposition that income and wealth in Australia should be redistributed towards ordinary
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          working people. Seventy&amp;hyphen;five per cent of the Australian Labor Party candidates agreed with that proposition. Three&amp;hyphen;quarters of Labor candidates surveyed agreed with that proposition. For the coalition? Sixteen per cent. So much for a party for battlers. So much for a party that states its support for ordinary working people. Only 16 per cent of their candidates at the last federal election thought that income and wealth should be redistributed towards those battlers.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This just goes to show that the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) may have left the coalition but her views linger on. They are revealed fully in the private prejudices of coalition members in this stunning survey. It is all there in black and white. It is all there in the survey results: the perceived threat from Asia, the economic isolationism, the strong suspicion about equal rights for migrants and women, the suspicion about helping Aboriginal Australians and, of course, not really doing anything positive for battlers—not wanting to do the positive thing of income and wealth redistribution to ordinary working families. Only 16 per cent of the coalition candidates believed in that element of redistribution in public policy.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I thought that, while I am on the subject of coalition cant and hypocrisy, I might say a few words and single out one member, the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson). During the adjournment debate on our last sitting day, the member for Bradfield, with all the elitism expected from a medical professional, spoke of mediocrity passing for debate in the House of Representatives. One of my little hobbies is to hold sanctimonious Tories to their own standards.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I ask, therefore: did the member for Bradfield mean by mediocrity someone who changes political parties the way most people change their underwear? Did he mean by mediocrity someone who presents himself as a saviour on all issues without advancing any new ideas? Did he mean by mediocrity someone who supports debating life and death issues in the non-controversial side chamber of the House? Or did the member for Bradfield mean by mediocrity the asking on notice of the following question to the head
         <break page="6432" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          of Australia's central bank and monetary authority:

        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Between 1972&amp;hyphen;1975 Australia had a fixed exchange rate. What in your assessment would be the effect on the value of the Australian dollar now if the budget outlays increased by equivalent proportions as they did in the early to mid 1970s and in particular, if the Government of the day announced a 14.6% increase in budget spending in one year, as the Whitlam Government did in the 1974-75 Budget?
        </para>
        <para>
         Of course, between 1972 and 1975 Australia did not have a fixed exchange rate, if by that the member for Bradfield meant that it could never move. What Australia had was an exchange rate determined by government rather than determined, as it is now, by the market with, from time to time, some intervention by the Reserve Bank of Australia. This was a government&amp;hyphen;determined exchange rate, but it could move, and it did move, over that three-year period.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Just for the edification of the member of the Bradfield, I point out that when the Whitlam government was first elected in December 1972 the Australian exchange rate was US119c. By the time of the coup in November 1975, the exchange rate was US127c. The Australian dollar had appreciated, in fact, by 8c against the American dollar. So there was an appreciation over time reflecting, of course, the mediocrity of the member for Bradfield. What a silly question to ask Australia's head of the Reserve Bank, especially when he didn't know the basis of his own proposition. The answer was to the credit of the Whitlam government.

         —I am going to introduce a slightly different thrust to this grievance debate because I am going to rejoice. I am going to rejoice on behalf of the Surfing Australia team which represented this country at the world titles at Huntington Beach, California, last month. They did extremely well indeed. There were 18 competitors consisting of men and women, juniors and seniors. Board riders competed in events for stand up, traditional long board, kneeboards and bodyboards. The team as a whole won the bronze medal from 680 competitors from 43 countries, so it is an absolutely outstanding result.

        Two people in particular I have to mention are from the electorate of Cowper. Nerida Falconer from Scotts Head won the gold medal for the open women's event, a fantastic result. Craig Ashdown, who also happens to be one of my staffers, and I am very proud of him, won the silver medal for kneeboarding. Of course other team members won the silver for the long board and the men's bodyboard. It is a tremendous result and one which the parliament should be advised of.

        Still on the issue of sport, I would like to raise the issue of the need for a bicycle velodrome at Macksville in the Nambucca Valley. The Nambucca Shire Council is prepared to donate a suitable piece of land—a natural amphitheatre—and this would be a regional facility managed by the local committee with support drawn throughout the whole of the mid&amp;hyphen;north coast, Australia's holiday coast. Although velodromes are not cheap to construct, once they are built they are very cheap to maintain. So the investment of funds into this will be very significant and a very long-term thing.

         It will be a focus for cycling in the region for road racing, recreational cycling as well as track racing. As we have found with the recent Olympic Games, cycling is becoming a more accepted sport. It is one that creates a lot of spectator interest. Having made representations to the Minister for Sport, Territor ies and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), I am taking this opportunity of reinforcing the need for some special funding to get this going. It is something which would benefit an enormous number of people. There is no velodrome between Newcastle and the Queensland border, and I believe that this would be a very sensible injection of funds from the federal government.

        I also need to bring to the attention of the parliament the fact of bananas being sold, somehow or other, illegally in Brisbane at a food fair held, I believe, about three months ago. Apparently, dried bananas from the Cook Islands were brought in and sold. They were wrapped in banana leaves, and of course the minister at the table, Mr Jull, will know that the spores of the disease black sigatoka are carried in the leaves.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The banana industry in Australia, both in Queensland and New South Wales, and to a lesser extent in Western Australia, is very significant. It is a family activity of horticulture and it ends up creating an enormous amount of employment and big contributions to the economies of the banana growing areas. In actual fact, the Australian Banana Growers Council has spent more than $1 million trying to keep black sigatoka out of Australia. I have seen it in the Torres Strait. It has come in from New Guinea. The last outbreak was at Weipa, on the western side of Cape York Peninsula, where every banana plant was infected. The authorities believed that the spores which infected the bananas at Weipa were either brought down in a cyclone or by people from Pascoe River, where there was an outbreak two years ago. I stress to the House that the quarantine regulations that are in place are essential. They are necessary and they are absolutely vital to protecting the Australian banana industry.

        Just to head back for a moment to another sporting area, on Saturday afternoon I had the very great pleasure of attending the opening of the Leon Adams Lawn at the Sawtell Croquet Club. I know the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), who is in the House, is one of those of us who acknowledges the pleasures of that game. It is very interesting

         to note that the Sawtell Croquet Club was founded in 1948. It was founded by wonderful people. One of those founding members, Islet Faichney, is 93 years old and she was there playing on Saturday.

         —Good for her indeed. I just wanted to bring this to the attention of the House because they opened their second lawn. They are only a small club—33 members. They had Rex Hardaker from the Coffs Harbour sporting group to do the official opening and name it the Leon Adams Lawn. Leon Adams is the club captain and has provided coaching. Probably the most outstanding year was 1992 when they had finalists in five state championships. So I thought it was appropriate to place on record the great success of the Sawtell Croquet Club.

        I am also concerned about a number of Vietnam veterans in my electorate who have approached me. They were under the impression that, with the funds being allocated by the Australian Vietnam War Veterans Trust, there may have been some discrimination against veterans who were also TPI pensioners. I wanted to make this issue clear, and I have been in touch with the trust. I will just refresh the minds of those members present. In an out of court settlement after the class action, a sum of $5.5 million was provided to the trust to allocate to those Vietnam veterans who had been affected by contact with agent orange. I must say, too, that when they received that $5.5 million they invested it. Until June this year, over $6 million had been handed out to veterans in need.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I must say too that I am aware the staff of the trust have been very severely overworked. I pay tribute to them for doing an excellent job. They assure me there is no policy of discrimination in the allocation of funds from the trust against veterans who are TPIs. All applications go before a committee of five, and that committee is made up of delegates from Vietnam veterans, Legacy, RSL and AVADS and one female. The distribution of the money is determined on the individual circumstances. There is no means test. Each case is looked at individually.

         —The Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) comprises two groups of measures. The first group of changes relates to limiting Medicare access for new medical practitioners. The second group of changes is a series of alterations to the medical benefits schedule. The majority of the budget changes to Medicare rebates took place with the issuing of the new schedule, which took effect last Friday. This bill contains a number of other changes which have to be made to the legislation itself.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I would like to turn, first of all, to the changes which the government is seeking to introduce in limiting access for new medical practitioners to Medicare provider numbers. The opposition has grave concerns about the effect of the government's proposed changes to Australia's medical work force. The Labor Party certainly understands the importance of seeking to manage the medical work force, in particular of managing access to Medicare to
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         ensure that the taxpayer and the Australian people get the best possible value for money.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Labor Party also understands the need to ensure that those practising medicine in Australia are of the highest possible standard and are appropriately trained. In recent years it was the former Labor government which took a number of decisions aimed at limiting the number of overseas trained doctors coming to Australia and it was the former Labor government which worked with the medical profession to improve the standing of general practice and to develop a system of postgraduate training for general practitioners.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        What the Labor Party did not do in government was to put in place a system which would retrospectively prevent existing Australian medical students and interns from having the opportunity to practise medicine. In our opinion, the government should have paid greater attention to reducing the medical school intakes and worked hard at restricting access for overseas trained doctors rather than simply attacking Australian trained medical students and interns who are currently halfway through their degrees. We do not believe it is right to disadvantage these students after they have put in years of study and training and after the taxpayer has invested in some cases more than $100,000 in their training.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I would like to turn to the element of this bill that seeks to retrospectively change the rules. Retrospectivity, as we all know, is a very blunt instrument in legislation. This legislation is highly retrospective. It significantly changes the career opportunities of a large number of young Australians after they have started their training—for some of them, seven years have passed since they made that career choice.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I imagine that most honourable members would be deeply disturbed by the fact that this legislation, if passed, will take effect from last Friday—that is, it will take effect from 1 November 1996. I would like to remind the House of some remarks which the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) made when discussing the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill in 1983. In the committee stage he made the following remark, and he is referring to the legislation:

         I think it is a matter of some substance because we are dealing with a fairly dangerous animal when we are talking about using retrospective legislation in any circumstances.
        </para>
        <para>
         So the Prime Minister certainly considers that any retrospective legislation is a dangerous animal. In fact, the current Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith), who in 1987 was the then opposition spokesman on legal matters, made some very impressive remarks about retrospective legislation. I would like to quote some comments he made at that time. The current Minister for Industrial Relations said:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         One of the common justifications for retrospective provisions is the claim that any criticisms are met by the fact that a prior ministerial statement has outlined the proposed law. This practice is very much a common feature of this Government.
        </para>
        <para>
         That was Mr Reith attacking the then Labor government. He went on:

        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         Ministerial edicts do not change the law—contrary to the belief of some. There is first the risk that the proposed alteration will not be made by Parliament and there is secondly the possibility, sometimes unfortunately realised, that the law, when enacted, will not correspond exactly with the antecedent announcement.
        </para>
        <para>
         Mr Reith goes on to make the statement:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         It is a practice which holds the Parliament, and thus the people, in contempt and it is wrong in principle in that it encourages retrospective legislative provisions.
        </para>
        <para>
         There we have some views of the former Chief Justice—at that time he was a judge on the High Court, I understand. We have the current Prime Minister and the current Minister for Industrial Relations making it clear they thought it was wrong for the former Labor government to use retrospective legislation to close tax loopholes to tighten up the tax act, yet this government announced in August changes which were to take effect on 1 November.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We have been unable to obtain the legislation until a few weeks before it takes effect.
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          In fact, the first opportunity that the opposition has to respond to the minister's second reading speech is three days after the legislation, if passed, takes effect. We all understand that it is quite possible that, with the current parliamentary backlog, it could be Easter next year before this legislation is debated and finally determined in the Senate.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The difficulty that the government faces is that when it was in opposition it altered the Senate standing orders. It did that in a deliberate way. In opposition, the Liberal and National parties argued that governments should only be entitled to introduce legislation in one session and have it determined by the Senate in the following session, unless the Senate gave agreement to a variation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We certainly are concerned that the government thinks that it can introduce legislation which will be retrospective and will have a serious effect on the careers of many young Australians, and expects to have it debated within a few weeks before the parliament rises by the end of the year. That might have other consequences for the government that I will go into in a few minutes. As I say, any government that uses retrospective legislation has to be very careful because it is a very blunt instrument.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I imagine that people understand that the provisions of this bill were always going to be highly controversial, and it is our view that they should have been introduced immediately after the budget. While the budget was handed down in the third week or so of August the government and the ERC obviously made this decision some weeks prior to the budget's being publicly released. In the past governments have usually followed their announcements on budget night with the introduction of a whole package, a whole raft, of budget measures. This is on the very night that the Treasurer delivers the budget speech.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         On this occasion, very little of the budget legislation is before the parliament. Quite a large number of proposals were announced on budget night, yet the parliament has not had a chance even to see the legislation or been able to have some idea as to the detail of the government's plans. I have to say that it is inexcusable that the minister was not able to
         <break page="6439" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          introduce a bill—certainly a bill of this importance—into the parliament until four sitting days before it took effect.

         The difficulty that the government faces is that if the Senate does not discuss or finally determine this legislation until next Easter, 1,200 young Australian doctors will be issued with provider numbers in January when they qualify to register. If the government is successful in having the legislation passed next year then some time, perhaps at Easter—if the legislation is passed—1,200 young Australian doctors, having received their provider numbers in January, will have their provider numbers taken off them when the legislation receives royal assent.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         That is no way to run a health system, and it is no way to determine the future of the careers of those 1,200 Australians. I have heard rumours that the government was considering gazetting regulations which would have prevented those 1,200 doctors being able to obtain provider numbers in the early new year. I am pleased to say that I received assurances from the department and the minister's office that there is no intention to attempt to withhold these provider numbers if the legislation is not passed until next year. I am grateful for that assurance from those concerned.

         Last week the minister made an announcement about his intention to introduce a 10&amp;hyphen;year moratorium on overseas trained doctors. I did welcome that on that day, but I have to say that I do not think it goes far enough. The reason why we believe that this is only a half measure is that Dr Wooldridge's amendments to his own legislation affect only overseas trained doctors who arrive in Australia after 1 January 1997. I understand that to mean that Dr Wooldridge's current proposal, the moratorium, will still allow those doctors—as many as perhaps 200 a year—to register as medical practitioners and to compete with graduates from Australian medicals schools for jobs in public hospitals.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The opposition believes that the minister has also been too generous in allowing overseas trained doctors who are already in Australia open access to Medicare and other medical jobs once they pass the registration

          exams. On current estimates, more than 500 of this group will pass these exams and compete with Australian graduates for places over the next five years. But the number will be higher if the Australian Medical Council does not accept the minister's request that they limit the doctors in this group to two exam attempts over five years.

         I would like to point out to the House that last Tuesday, when referring to overseas trained doctors who are already in Australia, the minister said, `They will have five years to have their skills assessed'—by the Australian Medical Council—`and they, too, will have two attempts to pass.' The minister gives the clear impression that this is going to affect the ability of overseas trained doctors to sit for the AMC exam.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It was only this morning that I learnt that it is actually only the minister's proposal to the Australian Medical Council. In fact, I got a clear impression, from the very strong words the minister gave to the House last Tuesday, of what the new rules would be for these overseas trained doctors. Yet we now learn that what the minister told the House would happen will occur only if the AMC agrees to the minister's suggestions. That is certainly a much weaker position. He went on to say:
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">

        </para>
        <para>
         If the minister feels so strongly, why is he taking only half measures? Why is he putting this 10&amp;hyphen;year ban on only overseas trained doctors who arrive after 1 January next year?
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In particular, if it is good enough for the minister to suggest to the Australian Medical Council that there should be new rules on how many occasions you can sit for the AMC exam, why will the minister not consider reimposing the limit on the number of overseas trained doctors who are allowed to proceed from the AMC's written exam to the AMC's clinical exam? I would like to spend a few minutes on that point.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The previous government imposed a quota on the AMC exams which effectively limited the number of overseas trained doctors who could work as doctors in Australia. This quota was challenged and overthrown by the Human
         <break page="6440" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission but, on appeal, the HREOC decision was reversed by the Federal Court. I am not a lawyer, but it now appears to me that there is, therefore, no legal barrier to the reimposition of a quota on the AMC exams at a level which will ensure that the students already in the system are not disadvantaged by these changes.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         If we look at what happens in other countries, such as the United States and Canada, we see that it is very difficult for Australian trained doctors to practise medicine in those countries. A number of people have pointed out that Australia allows many more overseas trained doctors to practise here than those countries allow. I offered the minister, in a private conversation, bipartisan support from the Labor Party if he was willing to impose tighter restrictions on the access of overseas trained doctors to the clinical exam which is set by the AMC—that is, the reimposition of a quota much lower than 200. Unfortunately, the minister has not agreed to pick up that suggestion. I think that is to be regretted.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         As a result of the minister allowing overseas trained doctors after 1 January to compete for places at public hospitals, and as a result of the minister's refusal to suggest to the AMC a tough new quota on the overseas trained doctors who are already in Australia, on my calculations that means as many as 1,500 overseas trained doctors will register and practise in Australia over the next five years in direct competition with the students in Australian medical schools and this year's interns—that is, they will be registering and practising in public hospitals as well as in general practice.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is a good example which can be used to point out why we think this is wrong. When the minister was copping some flak from the Australian medical students and interns about this decision, he broke his holidays and went on the John Laws program on 25 September. He claimed that 32 Sri Lankan doctors came into Australia via New Zealand—I think it was last year or the year before that. He was actually critical of the former government for allowing that to take place. As a result of the minister's decisions,
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          those 32 Sri Lankan doctors who came into Australia via New Zealand will be quite free to sit for the Australian Medical Council exams, whereas if the minister had taken up the opposition suggestion of a tough new quota we could have expected that it would have been more difficult for those 32 Sri Lankan doctors to be competing with the Australian trained medical students.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The main difficulty we have with this bill is that it is unfair to Australian medical students and interns. When the debate began the figures on which the savings were based assumed that about 200 Australian students and interns per year would miss out on provider numbers. Shortly after this, Dr Wooldridge, in that John Laws interview, said that very few Australian graduates would miss out on Medicare provider numbers. He claimed that the number would be fewer than 50 a year. More recently, I have noticed that Dr Wooldridge has become even more optimistic. In his press release last week he said that all Australian doctors and all Australian medical students and interns could expect to find a training place.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         These figures have been very rubbery. On 25 September, Dr Wooldridge claimed that there would be 430 overseas trained doctors coming to Australia. Last week he told the House that late amendments to his late legislation would result in 600 overseas trained doctors being stopped. In a similar way, Dr Wooldridge told the House on 12 September that there would be up to 600 specialty training places available and by 15 October, again in this House, this number had miraculously risen to 760 places.

        <para first-indent="16">
         If the Minister for Health and Family Services believes his latest set of figures and if he really does believe that no Australian medical student or intern will miss out on a training place, and, therefore, a Medicare provider number, I simply ask: why has the minister refused to give those students and interns a guarantee that that will be the case? The reason why the minister is refusing to do this is that we know he does not have enough faith in his own rubbery figures to give this guarantee. If the Minister for Health and Family Services does not have enough faith
         <break page="6441" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

         The Labor Party remains concerned that the proposal will also have an adverse effect on the provision of medical services in rural areas and on the options available to young doctors, particularly women medical students, who may not wish to proceed immediately after registration to full-time training.

         The women doctors, in particular, that I have spoken to make the point that, while the minister might be right in claiming that many of the colleges now allow women to take time off if they wish to have children or allow women to carry out some of their postgraduate training in a part-time way, many of the colleges continue to treat women unfairly in allocating places. If women do ask for some time off or ask to do their postgraduate training part time, they seem to be the ones who are less likely to gain a training place.

The date of effect of this element of the bill is, surprisingly, 1 November 1997, which means that those TRDs who are already here will be able to finish their contracts under the same conditions as when they signed them. This is appropriate and fair, but it also highlights that the government is prepared not to act retrospectively against certain groups of overseas trained doctors, but will not extend this same principle to students in Australian medical schools.

          I turn first to diagnostic imaging. Two of the Medicare related measures in this year's budget which the opposition believes do have merit are the reforms to pathology and diagnostic imaging. The government has recognised, as did the former government, that the very high growth rates in benefits for these services require action. In some ways they have built upon the model used by the former government in seeking to limit the cost of providing pathology services. I commend the government for its negotiations with the various elements of the profession in seeking to limit the levels of growth to more reasonable levels.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The multiple services rule for diagnostic imaging is part of an agreed package with the relevant part of the profession and is similar to agreements in place for multiple surgical services and multiple pathology tests. The opposition's concern is to ensure that these changes do not achieve these savings by cutting the fees for doctors, who then pass these directly on to patients. As I have explained, the opposition supports the principle and the approach of these reforms but we think the government and the HIC should continue to monitor billing practices in this area very closely to ensure that the agreed reforms do not mean that patients end up paying substantially more.

          I turn now to the maximum patient payment. The coalition promised before the election that `Medicare would be retained in its entirety'. The minister for health wrote to his own constituents, in that famous letter to the residents of Box Hill, specifically promising that Medicare rebates would not be changed. This measure, which would increase the patient's maximum payment—that is, the 15 per cent difference between the Medicare

          This measure is not small beans. It will raise nearly $60 million over four years. This money will be raised from those people who are seriously ill and require medical services with a schedule fee in excess of $200. It is hard to imagine how anyone could believe that this was a fair or reasonable measure. Even the minister does not seem to think so because neither the second reading speech nor the explanatory memorandum gives any reasons why it is appropriate to place an extra $60 million tax on those who are seriously ill. The minister is obviously not trying to defend the indefensible. This is also shown by his refusal to debate the atrocious decision to abolish the Commonwealth's dental health program last week. It is another example of a broken promise in health and it is a measure which simply ultimately ends up being a tax on the sick, and will be opposed by the opposition.

          I turn now to the removal of the MBAC's power to award higher fees for unusually long or complex services. This measure is an example of the new government's arbitrary approach to cutting Medicare. The government plans to save around $5 million in a full year by removing doctors' rights to claim for unusual items. The MBS lists thousands of items which are designed to cover all medical services, but occasionally unusual things occur which have not been foreseen. The reason that the MBAC was given the power to determine these fees was to cover this possibility.

          Perhaps I could give the House an example of why it is important that this committee continues to retain this power. Imagine if a rural general practitioner is called to an emergency on a remote property. She drives for more than an hour to reach the property and then finds that the patient has had an
          <break page="6443" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           accident with a piece of farm machinery and has sustained a serious injury. The GP treats the injuries as well as possible, treats the patient for shock, assists the family and then accompanies the patient to hospital. The whole episode could take four hours. There is no item which properly covers this afternoon's work by the GP, so under the current arrangements this GP would write to MBAC and explain the circumstances of the case and the committee would then determine a fair fee.

          If the same GP had instead done 16 quarter&amp;hyphen;hour consultations in their surgery, Medicare would have paid them around $300. Under the minister for health's current proposal, these new arrangements mean that the maximum a GP could claim for this four hours of work is $70.30, the rebate for a long home visit consultation. This is not a reasonable fee in these circumstances, and the doctor is left with the unenviable choice of accepting this inadequate fee or asking the patient to make up the difference of up to several hundred dollars.

          We also have some serious doubts about the way in which this particular measure was presented and the savings which are claimed for it. I understand that the amount paid out last year for unusually long or complex items was less than $&amp;half; million. So I am a little confused about how he can save $5 million a year from this. Looking through more of the budget material, I did find reference to the abolition of previous principles and precedents set by MBAC. If the savings from this part of the measure are up to 10 times that of the part we are being told about, then that is something that is more than a little misleading. I would be grateful if the minister could clarify that matter in his second reading reply.

           In summing up, in this budget we have seen a number of changes that begin the undermin ing of Medicare. Poor old Medicare—it is like that salami on the delicatessen's slicer. We have had reductions in rebates for women on the IVF program, we have had limits placed on rebates for people receiving psychiatric treatment and we have had reductions in rebates for knee and eye surgery. You may not now be reimbursed through Medicare for surgeons who assist in operations. Australians who seek to be trained as doctors are retrospectively having their careers affected by this legislation. We think many of these measures are ill thought out. In the detail stage, the opposition will be moving a number of amendments which will seek to express our concerns in some regard on these measures.

          Labor put private health insurance on the slippery slide. We now have incentives for those who take out private health insurance or who remain in it.

The Labor government got nowhere with COAG and would not even place health on the policy agenda.

The runs are going on the board, but there is much more to be done.

The large number of overseas doctors accessing the Medicare system was recognised as a problem by Labor, but they failed to grasp the matter and do something about it. Another testament to  Labor's inactivity in this area was its inability and unwillingness to manage the problem of having an oversupply of doctors in some areas and an undersupply in others. This problem should have been addressed years ago. Labor's neglect caused this mess with a lack of ability to address the labour force issues.

        A government can be expected to get work force issues and planning right when it spends $20 billion of taxpayers' money on health care. If it cannot, as is the case with the previous administration, costs blow out and the quality of care can be diminished. We need to get the balance right in various areas: hospitals, public health programs, general practice, various specialities and rural medicine. Labor got all this wrong. A healthy labour work force can never be entirely run on open market principles, and that is why good planning is required.

        In the past, the provision of Medicare provider numbers has been demand driven. This government is seeking to return to a more balanced situation. One of the major cost pressures on the health system in Australia is the chronic oversupply of doctors, already estimated by the Australian Institute of Health at 4,500 nationally, and simultaneously a dangerous shortage of 500 general practitioners in rural areas such as the Murray

        This legislation seeks to tackle both of these realities with four key strategies: reducing medical school intakes, reducing the numbers of overseas trained doctors migrating, reducing the need to bring in temporary overseas doctors to staff hospitals and, finally, getting a better distribution of doctors between rural and urban regions. The city of Adelaide, for instance, has one of the highest concentrations of doctors in Australia, with 194 practitioners for every 100,000 residents.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The slight reduction of intake levels at medical schools will be complemented by efforts to reallocate resources to the postgraduate level away from the undergraduate level. Given the timelag of six years for these measures to take full effect and the immediate crisis caused by the oversupply of doctors, however, the government must also reduce incentives for overseas trained doctors to migrate to Australia. The reality of the situation is that Australia has overly generous provisions for overseas trained doctors to enter Australia relative to other comparable countries. We have a situation where a large number of doctors are coming to Australia via New Zealand after only two years residency in that country. From 1 November 1997, temporary resident doctors will not be able to be deemed as medical practitioners for Medicare purposes unless they have the relevant overseas postgraduate qualifications.

        The need for this legislation has been encouraged by the shortage of doctors willing to work in the public hospital system here in Australia. In the past, it has been just too easy for medical graduates to hang up a shingle and bill under Medicare whilst the states have been bringing in temporary overseas doctors. There were 606 such doctors brought into this country last year. It would be a dereliction of the Commonwealth's responsibility for this absurd situation to continue and a sad reflection on the mismanagement of former Labor health ministers that this situation exists for the government now to have to address.

Other opportunities exist within the Commonwealth government and various agencies.

Any new doctor who wants to practise medicine will be able to do so. No doctor willing to work will be unemployed as a result of these measures. It is their right to unfettered private practice at

        New doctors will still be better off than virtually any other profession where significant numbers of graduates are in the unfortunate position of not being able to find any employment in their chosen fields. These measures to give provider numbers only to suitably trained doctors will, in fact, enhance the perception in the community of the role that doctors play in society. Given the relative explosion in medical research, new techniques and alternative treatments, general practice must now be considered a specialty in itself. It should not simply be accessed by practitioners who cannot or will not obtain specialty training in other areas.

Multiple services rules recognise that there is an over-remuneration in the components of the fees where more than one service is rendered to a patient. These measures are sensible, are not random and are designed to keep pace with changes that have taken place in medical and surgical practice.

         I commend the minister, who has undertaken extensive consultation in areas such as pathology to work out ways that these costs can be checked but at the same time ensuring that patients in no way suffer or have to pay more for it.

But if Medicare is to be sustained and the system not collapse, then these changes are necessary. I commend this bill to the House.

We consider that such an action would cause serious suffering, including a severe disadvantage to women and rural communities and medical research.

        This petition is particularly relevant coming from a place like Newcastle whose medical faculty has pioneered a community base for medicine which has seen a major shift in all the medical faculties towards a different set of criteria both for accepting students and, more importantly, as to how doctors and medicine are seen. Newcastle graduates are now quite famous for being more concerned about their patients and about wellbeing than necessarily about money.

        This issue is a difficult one. It is one that I do not profess to have all the wisdom on.

I say that because I find it difficult to link up how they can evaluate the savings that are projected. I find it difficult to understand the shifting ground in terms of overseas doctors, registrations, quotas and the like. We keep seeing a constant shifting of numbers and conclusions as to what effects it will have. On the one hand the minister is saying to the students that it will not affect them very much yet at the same time he is talking about substantial budget savings.

The previous speaker, the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), talked about the bill improving Medicare, but that petition from doctors says that this is an attack on Medicare. That is the fact. It is an attack on Medicare; it is not a defence of Medicare, as the government keeps on pretending.

This has been emphasised very clearly by a petition presented to the House today on behalf of 1,500 people in the Newcastle area. Amongst other things, the petitioners point out that the amendments are an attack on Medicare. I think those in the medical profession in Newcastle who drafted the petition would be more accurate in understanding the impact of these amendments than the government itself.

         This is a new form of social engineering that the government is proposing. It tells people to go to university and to spend seven years training and, after that, it rearranges the rules and decides whether or not they can work. It is social engineering: nothing more; nothing less. It is interference in the rights of individuals who have made their choice to follow a particular career.

         This has a number of consequences. The previous government had been successful in training young Aboriginals to become doctors. That program was started at Newcastle University in the mid&amp;hyphen;1980s and has been successful. We now have doctors working in Australia of Aboriginal background, providing good medicine and good service to the community. They are also wonderful role models. They have shown that education was available and accessible. Young Aboriginals at school looking to their future as doctors see them as valid role models.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This new system means that those young people will have to find another way to become recognised in their communities because this impediment that is now being proposed will disrupt substantially what would have been their normal pathway. Young Aboriginals currently in medical faculties with the expectation of becoming doctors and servicing their communities will have to think again because of these changes. They are going to have to pass another hurdle to be accepted by the college. What that means, God only knows! None of us know and I am sure that the students do not know.

         The point has been made very fluently by many doctors of the effect this will have on women. Many young women doctors do not

         Young medical graduates undertaking research will be in a similar situation. We have relied very much on these people. They work part time as locums, while working in research. If there is no part&amp;hyphen;time work, the capacity to be researchers will be taken away. We all know it is there. We have used that system very successfully, and it has been good for all of us. It has been good for them because it has meant that some of our best and brightest could go into the research field and not have to be paid up to the full scale because they could work part time and augment their income. In effect, they were not only doing research on the cheap but also getting experience in medicine and keeping up their skills. That will clearly change.

         These are all the things that the government should have talked about. It is not unreasonable for a government to propose changes to the system. That is what governments are there for. This was not a proposed change. This change was announced as a fait accompli. I did not hear any members opposite discussing this over the last six months, during the campaign or before the budget. I did not hear it being canvassed or it being suggested that this was the outcome of a series of public discussions or debates of any kind. It was announced on budget night as a fait accompli not to improve the health system but to achieve a certain revenue objective.

         I said earlier that one wonders about and questions the validity of the numbers and the extrapolations. We, on this side, accept that there may be some validity. If you recall, in the previous parliament we looked at reducing the numbers of students going into medicine—not by restricting those who were coming out from being able to practise but by curtailing entrance into training programs, which would have an effect. It would be foolish of us to say that there may be no linkage. Certainly, in that discussion a couple of years ago a lot of people suggested that our

         If we had heard those opposite canvassing this view with the community, with the medical fraternity, with their own backbench in some public way, then what would have come forward would have been the result of a process. What we have had is not a process at all; it has been a railroading. Those doing it are not doing it for the good of doctors, patients or the health system; they are doing it because of some mythical notion that they have on what can be spent on health vis&amp;hyphen;a&amp;hyphen;vis which part of health. The whole notion of how to apportion public expenditure is valid.

         We have heard previous speakers talking about the effect of government spending and how the last government did dreadful things, and so on. The fact is that, during the time of the last government, the amount of public spending went down as a proportion of the country's wealth and capacity and the spending on health was maintained at a very regular level, and in world terms it was at a very respectable level. There has been no massive blow&amp;hyphen;out in health costs. There has been no unacceptable surge or disproportionate spending on health vis&amp;hyphen;a&amp;hyphen;vis other issues.

         The idea that this is somehow essential to save Medicare or to save the nation is just a nonsense. If the government had proposed this as a course of action for discussion, then we would have been happy to have discussed it. It would have been an interesting and perhaps useful discussion. If this was done, I do not doubt that at the end of the day the conclusion would have been quite different from what has been put forward now. If this had been discussed openly, it would have been found to be very unfair and very discriminatory.

         There is no reason why those young people who are currently embarked on a medical career of seven years duration or one year's duration should suddenly find the whole world changed without having had the chance to comment.

          The fact is that these amendments will not get through the parliament in this calendar year. They will sit in the Senate for months to come. That will be non-productive, anyhow. The fact is that these amendments were only brought in last week. They came in at the end of October, after being announced in August, and it is now November. That is appalling. That delay and that lateness by the government indicates that they consider this legislation to be of low priority—measures that came into force, supposedly, last Friday. The legislation came into the parliament last week, four days before it was to take effect. What a disgraceful performance. What an insult to these people.

          Rather than having these amendments sitting in the Senate doing nothing, the idea of them going to a committee allows for there to be some public input.

          Clearly, the government has not thought about these amendments very much at all. To watch what has come forward and to watch the government attacking the messenger, if you like—and I notice that the remarks of the minister have been increasingly hostile—indicates that very little thought went into this. No cogent argument has been put forward in their support. There simply has been this mantra that `this is to save Medicare' somehow.

Those young people, I can assure the government, are extremely angry—and not just angry, but well informed. They see this for the charade that it is and are offended at the way with which it has been dealt. They are offended that they were not given a chance to talk about it or even canvass it in any form whatsoever.

They may be able to call themselves doctors, but they will not be able to charge for their services because they will have to go through a whole stack of hurdles and hoops. If this legislation is passed, we will all expect—and with some justification, I think—the hurdles to become more and more complicated.

A very small amount of money per year has been involved in that, but it did give a capacity for very special cases to be dealt with. That being wiped out is quite stupid, particularly for those of you with rural electorates where doctors may be toiling for many hours on what may end up being a very minor case but on which, because of isolation, complexity and access to transport, they could in fact spend a long time.

         —I will address some of the issues raised by the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) when I finish what I have prepared to say. The Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996 is a piece of legislation that will not only secure the longer term viability of Medicare, contrary to what we have just heard, but with it the professional and financial base of general practice. It will do so through changes to the availability of Medicare provider numbers and measures to contain growth in two areas which have been of major concern to the previous government and also this one and that is in pathology and radiology.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The bill introduces changes in three important areas, the first of which is Medicare provider numbers. From 1 November 1996 only those who have either trained, whether it be in specialist or general medical practice, or those who are in the process of training in a supervised training program will be issued with a Medicare provider number. A provider number, for those who do not know, is necessary before a service provided by a medical practitioner will attract a Medicare benefit. The estimated savings over the four years of the forward estimates are in the vicinity of $570 million. But I do accept the concerns of those who wonder how we may have arrived at that figure. Who knows? It may be higher. Let us hope it is not lower.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second major area of change is Medicare benefit restructuring, most notably in pathology where benefits will increase by six per cent in the next financial year but with a cap on the total funds available for pathology triggering a reduction in fees should the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         amount of money being spent go over budget in the pathology area. This form of agreement is historic.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As someone who has represented the medical profession in my former life I believe that people should not underestimate the importance of the arrangement at which the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has arrived with the Royal College of Pathologists of Australia, the Australian Association of Pathology Practices and also the Royal Australasian College of Radiologists in radiology restructuring.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For the first time we have an agreement in a fee for service system which will cap the total amount of money which the Commonwealth will commit to a particular program. There is provision for renegotiation of the agreement to take into account significant changes in the emergence of significant new tests and diseases. The savings there are not insignificant—$344 million are anticipated over the four years of the forward estimates.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In a similar fashion, radiology restructuring, including nuclear medicine, which will be implemented progressively from 1 November 1996, has been developed in cooperation with the Royal Australasian College of Radiologists and the Australian and New Zealand Association of Physicians in Nuclear Medicine. The measures will promote more appropriate, quality, cost-effective diagnostic imaging practice by introducing multiple service rules—similar rules apply in surgery—so that, if a radiology provider provides one service and then in conjunction with that a second one is provided, that second service and subsequent services may attract a lower benefit.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Similarly, there are targeted changes to fee relativities, item restructuring and a move toward capital sensitive items, which has to be in the interests of everyone, particularly radiologists who are spending an enormous amount of money on capital and also patients who rely on the services being provided. The benefit needs to relate in some way to the capital intensive nature of the service being provided.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other important thing for which the minister has not been given specific credit—
        <break page="6452" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         and I include the medical profession in that—is a review of the ultrasound arrangements in light of the forthcoming report by the Australian Health Technology Advisory Committee. Over the next two years an accreditation system will be developed in consultation with both professional bodies. I think that reflects a growing maturity at least in the pathology and radiology areas of the medical profession. Again, $241 million over the four years of the forward estimates is a significant contribution to turning the government's deficit into surplus.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        However, the most contentious aspect of the bill is the decision to restrict Medicare provider number eligibility to medical graduates who have either successfully completed postgraduate training or who are in the process of undertaking such training. Given the complexity of modern general practice and the reasonable demands of community expectation, it is not unreasonable to expect someone who has completed an undergraduate degree to specifically train for family medicine. A six-year degree does not, even though it is long and arduous, prepare you for family medicine.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I remember when I left the teaching hospital environment I spent six months working in a neonatal intensive care unit. When I went into general practice I could resuscitate a baby; in fact, I could do almost anything with a seriously ill baby, but the problems people bring their children to you for in general practice are quite different. These days, despite what some students may feel, it does require formal postgraduate training. As such, I think this measure is to be applauded.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Such training can only raise the professional esteem of general practice and, ultimately, secure the financial base of a discipline that will require a total of 10 years of rigorous training. When those on the other side, as they most certainly have done in the past and I am sure will continue to do, criticise the incomes of doctors, just remember that they have to get in the top one per cent to get in there in the first place. They will then have to take 10 years of extremely rigorous training. They will have to go through all kinds of hoops. We are now introducing the last of
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         them:  having completed their degrees, only a limited number will be able to get into postgraduate training. People ought to hose themselves down a bit when they criticise the incomes of these people once they finally get there.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        From the government's perspective, there is also the pressing economic need for such a decision as there is a clear relationship between the number of doctors there are and the expenditure on the medical services. For example, in metropolitan Sydney the number of pathology services provided per head of population is seven times higher than in rural New South Wales. This year the Commonwealth will spend about $19.4 billion on health. In 1995-96 the Labor government allocated $18.4 billion. Of the $7.3 billion allocated for the Medicare benefit schedule about $6.1 billion is budgeted this year to flow directly to doctors who are billing services reimbursed under Medicare.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Outlays on Medicare services grew at 9&amp;half; per cent a year between 1985 and 1994, mainly because of the increase in per capita number of services provided annually to patients. The member for Newcastle, who understandably is concerned about the sustainability of Medicare, ought to reflect on the fact that 9&amp;half; per cent growth per annum over a decade and 5&amp;half; per cent real growth per annum over the last three years is hardly a recipe for sustainability. Any responsible government, if it is committed to Medicare, has to do something substantial to address that.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Over the past three years—it is worth focusing on that for a moment—there has been 5&amp;half; per cent real growth per annum. Those in business, I am sure, would love to see growth of those proportions, but in a government expenditure program you simply cannot sustain that. Particularly, it is unsustainable in an economy with an underlying growth rate of between two per cent and three per cent.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The number of providers—that is, the number of doctors—increased from 27,807 in 1984 to 39,812 in 1994-95. Over the same period of time, the Australian population increased 14.6 per cent. So there was a
        <break page="6453" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         disproportionately large growth in the number of providers when contrasted with the general growth in population.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In an environment where, by the very nature of medical practice, the consumer or patient is unable to know whether they really do need the service and providers have an obvious interest in providing it, the process is further skewed by the absence of a price signal to the consumer in over 70 per cent of cases, which of course refers to bulkbilling. It is little wonder, then, that doctors have at times powerful incentives to drive service provision to a level that meets income expectations. That is why we find that doctors working in overdoctored areas, particularly in inner Sydney and Melbourne, are able to sustain an income where one might reasonably question whether there is sufficient demand for the services they are providing.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Although I appreciate that this is a contestable statement, the recent Australian medical work force benchmark study, prepared by the Australian Medical Work Force Advisory Committee, estimated that on the basis of a reasonable patient workload there is a 19 per cent oversupply of equivalent full-time general practitioners in Australia, most of whom are in capital cities—930 in Sydney and 414 in Melbourne.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The provision of services seems to reflect doctor presence as well as patient need. In order to give members an understanding of that, looking at the Medicare benefits paid per capita in a number of electorates will illustrate the point. For the year 1993-94 for example in Kalgoorlie, Medicare spent $137 per head of population. In the New South Wales electorate of Parkes, $229 was spent per man, woman and child. In Wentworth in Sydney, $461 was spent per man, woman and child. In Melbourne Ports, $413 was spent.

        Morbidity and mortality figures are worse in rural areas, yet the per capita Medicare expenditure is lower. Every extra general practitioner practising full time generates 7,000 services annually and costs about $200,000 in Medicare outlays. At the moment, the net number of doctors billing under Medicare is growing by just over two per cent a year, or around a thousand a year. If these
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

        The real contributor to growth in the net number of active doctors, those who are actually using their provider numbers—the member for Newcastle, with this nonsense he is on about, ought to remember that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) is not practising at the moment; he is putting 200 per cent of his time into trying to turn around the mess we were left by the previous government—for billing under Medicare, which, as I said, reached 39,812 in 1994-95, was overseas trained doctors. In fact, the overseas share of growth each year for the last decade has averaged about 25 per cent each year. In 1994-95, for  example, 758 local graduates became active using Medicare provider numbers, whereas 303 overseas trained doctors commenced the use of provider numbers. In other words, the number of local contributors to Medicare utilisation was double that of those coming from overseas.

        Given the announcements by the government of new arrangements for overseas trained doctors, I hope that the government may be able, as we go along—this is a personal perspective—to reconsider a short program, perhaps over a period of a few years, to constantly keep under review the number of training positions which are available in general practice. If there is, as I hope will appear, a significant reduction in the number of overseas doctors taking up provider numbers, then perhaps if things are not working out for our current crop of medical students and interns we may still be able to come in well underneath the forward estimates in the budget, maintain the integrity of the budget and make sure that those who wish to have access to general practice training. I am confident that the minister will be keeping the situation under review.

        If you examine the issue of overseas trained doctors, you see that there has been a sharp increase in the number of New Zealand doctors. For example, in 1994-95 there was a net increase—that is, those coming in less those going out—of 182 from New Zealand.
        <break page="6454" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         Most of those went to Queensland and New South Wales; however, when you look more closely, you see that many of the New Zealand registered doctors were actually born in third country locations. For example in 1994-95, 232 New Zealand citizen doctors arrived. Ninety-six were not New Zealand born. Of those, 39 were from Sri Lanka, 23 were from the UK and 10 were from India.

        At the moment there are up to 2,000—this is another major problem—migrant doctors living in Australia who are yet to begin the accreditation process. Of these, according to the census data I could see, there are 857 Chinese born. These are persons who claim medical qualifications at degree level living in Australia as at 1991, yet only 37 are actually practising as doctors.

        The other issue this bill will be addressing is temporary visa doctors. The bill requires equivalence of qualification but, with the agreement of the minister, labour work force agreements will enable continued use where it is essential. I think that is a point worth making for those in regional seats and those who are, understandably, concerned about doctors getting into rural areas. Temporary visa doctors will still be able to come. The minister will be required to make sure they meet a standard which is acceptable here in Australia. But, importantly, the minister will be able to use discretion in making decisions.

        In 1995-96, about 600 of the total 870 visas issued were to newly sponsored doctors entering from overseas, the great majority of whom arrived in the past year. They need to be sponsored by an employer, of which Queensland is the dominant source. Four hundred and eighty-one sponsors were approved in 1994-95 and 383 were approved last year, despite a labour market agreement of 65, hence the value, if you like, of labour market agreements for the medical work force.

         The implications of this high dependence on temporary visa doctors is rather serious. Because visas can be renewed and a temporary visa doctor can stay in Australia potentially for up to four years, there may be as many as 2,000 temporary visa doctors in Australia. Although many of them are sala ried, many actually work, particularly in Queensland, as medical superintendents, with limited rights at private practice and therein access to Medicare provider numbers, and also as locums. These people are obviously adding significantly to the provider induced growth in Medicare outlays.

        People need to understand—this gets to the heart of where the concern is—that young doctors and interns are not opposed to the idea of postgraduate training. What they are concerned about is the fact that there is a limit to the number of training positions that are available. For example, this year there were about 550 applicants for the 400 positions available for the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners training program. But as someone who knows these people inside out and back to front, I can also tell you that within that 550 will be a group who do not really know what they want to do. Their cut&amp;hyphen;off date for application was in July. They do not really know what they want to do but, just to cover bases, they will apply for a training program, in this case general practice training.

         A summary of the picture that we now face is that we have 1,200 Australian graduates a year. That is down from around 1,500 in the mid&amp;hyphen;1980s. In Australia we decided that we had a need to reduce the number of doctors, so we started planning to do that. At the same time we had an exponential growth in the number of doctors wishing to come here from overseas. The overseas trained doctors now, pre&amp;hyphen;January 1997, will be able to sit the Australian Medical Council exam twice. I understand there may be a very small quota on those who will be able to then get access to the College of General Practitioners training program. After January 1997 there will be no limit, but they will not be able to get a provider number for 10 years. That is emi nently reasonable to say the least.

We have provided $1 million a year to assist in employing locums in rural areas and $26 million over four years to establish university departments of general practice.

They resent the fact that Australians love  Medicare and they resent the fact that, as a consequence, they have been forced to put aside their ideologically driven feelings on Medicare—put those on the backburner—and at least appear to, at this stage, be supporting Medicare.

A further reduction in the service of GPs may very well represent the final nail in the coffin of many rural towns. We have seen so many attacks on regional and rural Australia since this government was elected only seven months ago—the abolition of the division of regional development and the revocation of drought assistance in many areas of my electorate. Things like the sale of Telstra, cuts to labour market programs and cuts to skillshare impact disproportionately upon towns in rural Australia. This shortage of GPs represents another whack indeed.

The councillor could see what a devastating impact the loss of that doctor could have on that town.

         —I am pleased that the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) has raised this issue of the problem about rural doctors because that is precisely the reason why I support the measures in this Health Insurance Amendment Bill. He quoted figures from his electorate. I note that my electorate is mentioned in the same document. It has the worst figures in the state of Victoria in its proportion of rural doctors—70.7 per 100,000. So no-one is more conscious of the difficulty that rural hospitals and rural practices have in attracting Australian doctors than I am.

         Given the member for Hunter's comments, the problem is that he does not really understand how this particular measure in this bill fits into a suite of policy measures being addressed by the government. The govern ment has recognised the serious nature with regard to the supply of rural doctors. I am pleased to have the support—finally, after three years—of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) and the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson). This is not something that has been decided in a hurry. We have spent quite an amount of time developing policy over the last three years. I am very pleased that some of my concerns are finally being addressed.

        Let me take a little time to explain why I am comfortable that this measure, coupled with many of the other announcements the government is making, is going to address my problem. There are a total of 24 hospitals in my electorate. In the three years that I have been the member for Mallee, I have been involved in the process of attracting doctors to 12 of them. Of those 12 doctors placed so far, only two have been Australians. The hospitals went through an immensely difficult time advertising locally, within the state, across the nation and then, finally, they had to resort to advertising internationally.

        This is not something that a hospital or a medical practice chooses to do lightly. It takes 18 months. After the hospital has secured a suitable applicant who is keen, the applicant then has to satisfy the medical board on qualifications and then satisfy the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs on all of those issues. It is a prolonged, tortuous process. As I have said, along with all the other measures being announced, I am comfortable that this decision, coupled with the announcement made by the minister in regard to overseas doctors, will finally address a desperate problem in my electorate, although it may be some time before these measures will have an effect.

        I note that the bill specifically relates to the requirement for medical graduates to complete postgraduate education prior to gaining access to the Medicare schedule and to allow regulations to be made to reduce the Medicare benefit payable when multiple services are rendered. The member for Bradfield has covered those broader initiatives quite well, so I will not take time addressing those.

         All of these arrangements are somewhat complicated to explain. I certainly have had a number of young graduates and their parents from my electorate approach me. After I have explained the broad objectives and vision that we have, they become comfortable. It is not about restricting the career path of doctors: there are so many other options available to them.

         Hospitals often complain to me that it is difficult to attract and keep doctors in the public hospital system because it is so readily easy for them to gain access to a provider number and move across into private practice. What this part of the bill does is to limit the sort of expected unfettered right to be underwritten at taxpayers' expense through the Medicare system, which has other flow-on benefits. I am quite confident that after a period the direction we plan these measures to take will have effect.

         The bill results from the 1996 budget decision to restrict access to the Medicare system and is often referred to as a decision to restrict the number of Medicare provider numbers—which must be held for a doctor to assess Medicare benefits. The scheme focuses on what is an important aspect of this whole issue of rural doctors—that is, education—rather than on an ad hoc or arbitrary system of ballot for the availability of provider numbers.

         All of this is strongly linked to the supply of doctors. It continues to amaze me that I have regular requests from medical clinics and hospitals across my electorate, so frustrated by the fact that no Australian doctor has applied for an advertised position. Other speakers have mentioned—and it is recorded in the Australian Institute of Health estimates—that apparently there is an oversupply of 4,500 general practitioners, mostly located in metropolitan areas, whilst electorates like Mallee and Hunter suffer a shortage—a shortage in total across the nation of 500 general practitioners.

         Let me describe some of the experiences that I have had. Currently the city of Mildura, which has a huge base hospital servicing a metropolitan city population of 22,000 people and a regional population of about 45,000 people, is currently desperately short of nine practitioners. They have been advertising and doing all the right things to try to attract Australian doctors, but desperate measures drive people to desperation. They sent their executive officer overseas on a recruitment drive.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         You can imagine the impact that the absence of nine practitioners has on the economics of a hospital. So far, only two of the nine positions have been applied for by Australian doctors. It is not just a problem for small hospitals out in isolated areas. Sunraysia and the city of Mildura are part of a very strong population centre with tremendous lifestyle and education advantages, yet it is still difficult to attract doctors.

         The provincial city of Horsham down in the Wimmera, which has a city population of about 13,500 people and a regional population of about 25,000, is trying to attract two specialists—an anaesthetist and a gynaecologist. So it is not just the small hospitals that are having difficulties; it is the large provincial centres as well. The fact that doctors have such ready access to their provider numbers makes it far too easy for them to stay in a metropolitan centre and not be attracted to rural areas.

         Two modifications to the government's policy relating to the attraction of doctors in rural areas was announced in question time here on 15 October. The minister has made an even stronger statement about overseas doctors since that time. I received a phone call from one of my very small hospitals as a result of that announcement. It was from a community with a population of 300 people. Two and a half years ago their hospital was in desperate strife. It is a very small hospital. In the six months following my election to the seat of Mallee in 1993 their hospital

         An overseas doctor finally indicated an interest, after 18 months. He was British trained and at that stage was practising in Saudi Arabia. From the time he indicated his interest to the time he finally arrived in Manangatang another eight months had passed. Had it not been for his arrival, there would be no hospital in Manangatang. It has been very pleasant to see the hospital rise from its demise since that time. Two Sundays ago I went to their annual general meeting where an announcement was made that the hospital made a profit of about $144,000. That was the impact that having a good doctor committed to the small rural community had on that hospital. They were so inspired that they invited an additional doctor to the community at Manangatang. He arrived last Sunday. But he is a foreign doctor from Afghanistan.

         Those members from the other side who stand up and champion the cause of rural Australia had a long opportunity to address these important issues. Their approach was to fiddle with the supply of GPs. Most notable was the attempt to restrict the number of people entering medical courses. That attempt involved a planned reduction of approximately 200 students per year, but it failed when the Vice-Chancellors Committee could not identify more than 20 places that could be removed in the long term. I think they were a little insincere, although I would not accuse the member for Hunter of that. I know him better. I think it is probably more that he does not quite understand completely and seems a little nonplussed why those of us who represent rural areas are so eagerly supporting this legislation.

But I could tell by the tone in his voice that he was expressing some lack of confidence in my capacity to finally win the argument. I simply said to him, `Dr Nik, they will send you back to Croatia over my dead body. I can offer you a consultancy if you need it.' His visa was finally stamped on 2 September this year.

         After a period of probably 12 months of complicated wrangling with the department of immigration and satisfying the medical board, the ultimate indicator of just how complex we have let this system become in respect of those overseas doctors who want to make a commitment to rural areas was a request to supply to the department of immigration a letter from the Commonwealth Employment Service saying that no Australian doctor had applied for the position. I ask you, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, from your knowledge of the medical profession, how many doctors would actually apply for positions through the CES. But we supplied that letter in compliance. It is just a delight to have a committed doctor such as Dr Nik Kosanovic in the Charlton community making a contribution and ensuring the longevity of that hospital in that vital and very important rural area.

        Under these amendments, all overseas trained doctors who have not registered to practise in a state or territory or commence the Australian Medical Council assessment process by 1 January 1997 will not be eligible to receive a Medicare provider number for billing under Medicare for at least 10 years. New Zealand trained doctors and overseas students who are graduated from an Australian medical school are included in this measure.

        This move is long overdue. Australia graduates 1,200 medical students a year. Australia has immigrating to it approximately 600 further doctors a year. It is absolutely ludicrous that we take another 50 per cent over and on top of our graduation by way of overseas trained doctors. No other country allows this. We have found that, as other countries have progressively tightened their immigration requirements for doctors, we have become a target for many countries overseas.

        It is necessary to bring New Zealand into this measure because otherwise New Zealand would have become a staging post for doctors wishing to enter Australia. Indeed, there is some evidence that this is happening already. On the best information that I can get, 32 doctors from one country entered Australia last year: having been born and trained overseas and having moved to New Zealand and taken up citizenship, they used this to have right of entry and practice into Australia. Similarly, with 11 per cent of medical graduates now full fee paying overseas students, we simply cannot control our medical supply numbers if these people have the opportunity

        There are two elements here. The first is that these people have come from overseas countries, usually our neighbours and friends, with the express intention of returning overseas at the end of their training. It is unfair to those countries from where they came, when those countries have sponsored them, for them to lose some of their best and brightest young people. Should they marry and decide to stay, we are not saying they cannot work as a doctor. There are many opportunities open to them. What we are saying is, `You cannot add to our oversupply of medical practitioners in private practice. You cannot circumvent the immigration requirements for Australia. You have an opportunity to apply for one of the 400 vacancies in public hospitals around Australia. You have an opportunity to apply for one of the 50 vacancies in the armed services or one of the vacancies that currently exist in my department. You can work in academia, you can work in industry. But you cannot get a Medicare provider number.' So, should someone decide to stay, there will be enormous opportunities open to them, but there will not be the opportunity to add to our oversupply.

        The Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996 also deals substantially with the issue of who can and cannot access Medicare provider numbers. It has been interesting to listen to the debate. I would suggest that this is a debate that will be looked upon in the future because there is no doubt that what we are debating here tonight is a turning point for Medicare. The choice is very simple. You can have a Medicare that is unsustainable and that is doomed to failure—and that is what we have at the moment—or you can have a Medicare that has some prospect of being sustainable over the long term.

        The reason is simple. Health has a demand curve that is relatively inelastic. People will demand much of it, regardless of the price.

If we wish to have an open&amp;hyphen;ended fee for service system, which we do, and if we wish to keep that affordable,

        Brian Howe, former Labor Deputy Prime Minister and health minister, understood that when he said that the unrestricted access to general practice was a time bomb that would destroy Medicare. Graham Richardson, a former Labor health minister, understood that when he told the AMA in 1993 that the system whereby provider numbers were given as a right of graduation could not be expected to continue indefinitely. Indeed, the AMA understood it when, in 1992, they passed a motion saying that doctors entering medical school could not expect training as a matter of right and course.

        The choice here is very simple. You either have a health system that is sustainable, you either have a Medicare that we can hope to finance in the long term, or you have something that will collapse. Over the last decade Medicare has increased six per cent per annum real compound and, in the end, has a budget of over $6.2 billion, larger than the budget of the entire state of Western Australia. That is not something that can go on forever.

        It is absurd to suggest that you cannot make changes in medical career opportunities after someone enters medical school. If you wait another six years, there will be another 7,000 doctors in Australia adding to the oversupply already of GPs, just in urban areas, of 4,500. Nobody can expect that career opportunities will not change over six or seven years—and why should doctors be any different? Medicine is a very rapidly developing field. Some areas, such as laparoscopic surgery, barely existed seven years ago. With this sort of rapid development in opportunities, our health system must change to follow medical practice. To suggest otherwise is, quite frankly, breathtaking in its hypocrisy.

Nobody could claim that people going into medical school, and young doctors affected by this legislation, have not been aware of the possibilities. As I said, two previous Labor health ministers have made it utterly clear. The AMA itself, in 1992, made it utterly clear. And that just shows the intellectual bankruptcy of the arguments against it.

I do not want to see well-trained young people delivering the mail as young doctors are in Italy or Belgium. Quite frankly, unless we bite the bullet and do what should have been done years ago, and do what was inevitable after the 1989 changes introduced by the previous government, that will happen. In the meantime, the uncontrolled increase of medical student numbers, of general practice numbers, will continue unabated and will mean the Medicare benefits schedule will continue to go out of control. That will mean to the overall health budget that I am severely restrained from doing anything in public health, in preventative medicine, in Aboriginal health and in medical research, because the whole budget is geared towards controlling an insatiable supply side driven increase in the Medicare benefits schedule.

        There are about 1,200 doctors registered with the AMC. On past experience, we can expect 400 or slightly more to pass eventually. Of those who have already commenced the exams—the clinical exams are under way at this very moment—we can expect about 280 to pass. It would be unreasonable and unfair to put a quota on those who are in the middle of the exam process now. The only effect of putting a quota on now would be to put a quota on the difference between those who pass this time and those who are likely to pass eventually, which is the difference between 280 and 400, which is 120. Given the quota that is being proposed generally—previously it was 200 and it has been suggested it might be 150—the fact is there are probably only another 120 to get through anyway. So a quota would be not only pointless and ineffective but unfair and discriminatory against a large number of Australian citizens.

Some came here at a time when we were actively recruiting doctors from overseas. I think it is only reasonable that we give them a chance to have their skills assessed. If their skills are up to standard, they will have a chance to work; if they are not up to standard, they will face the same choices that an Australian medical student faces, that is, to try to find a university which will take them in to get further training or to choose another career.

         Those who do pass the AMC exam will be subject to the same requirements as other doctors. They will need additional postgradu ate training, and that is not before time. The effect of successive changes over several decades in health, to be fair, have meant that general practice is the dumping ground for medicine. That has left a bunch of general practitioners who are deskilled and of whom, according to Bob Douglas from the ANU survey last year, one&amp;hyphen;third would leave tomorrow if there were something else they could do. Given that general practice is the primary health care network in Australia, I think that is a tragedy. General practice is a specialty area that deserves special recognition and that requires special skills. Two years of training in brain surgery or cardiology equip you not at all to go into general practice. It is about time we were prepared to give general practice the recognition it deserved.

        This does not mean that doctors will be on the scrap heap. As best we can determine, there are about 1,300 advanced training positions available in Australia this year and there are 1,200 doctors graduating. The 280 or so doctors who pass the AMC exam will not all come on stream at once. They will filter through the system over several years because of the requirement to do residency years. The fact is that there will be training for everyone who wants it. There will be the capacity to train somewhere, and it might actually mean that we get some trainees going to psychiatry, rehabilitation or occupational medicine—something that should have happened years ago. I feel no obligation to give every 25&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old, second&amp;hyphen;year doctor a guaranteed income for life so that they can go and bulkbill their head off in Medicare clinics up and down the Pacific Highway and earn $100,000 a year.

I regret that the opposition has not grasped this basic fact.

         —It is certainly a pleasure to participate in the debate this evening on the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. This bill will give legislative effect to 1996 government budget decisions that discontinue the payment of an untargeted operational subsidy to community based long day care centres from 1 July 1997; apply a reduced rate of entitlement to the child-care cash rebate for families on higher incomes, while retaining the current rate for families on lower incomes, this change to take effect from 1 April 1997; and introduce amendments aimed at clarifying eligibility issues and compliance requirements consistent with the intentions of the Commonwealth child-care cash rebate scheme.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The nature of the operational subsidy that had been applied to community based long day care centres had its origins back in 1972, and then was changed in 1985. So from 1972 to 1985 the operational subsidy provided to community based long day care centres equalled 75 per cent of the salaries of approved qualified staff based on attendance of children on a particular representative day. The funding formula was based on one nurse for each 20 children over the age of three; one teacher for every 15 children over the age of three; and one nurse for every 10 children under three years of age. Then in November 1985 the funding formula was changed and the amount of subsidy paid per child, based on approved places and utilisation rates, reduced the amount of operational subsidy on average by approximately 50 per cent.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I have a bit of experience with community based long day care centres in my electorate. We have a number of them, although they cater for the smaller percentage of children who attend long day care centres in the electorate. In fact, in my electorate of Lyne there are 43 centres servicing the requirements of families with long day care. In the community based long day care centres, there are 251 children; in the family day care section, there are 205 children; and in the private long day care centres there are 602 children. So

        I probably have had more experience with the community based long day care centres than the private providers. It was in 1985 as an alderman on the Greater Taree City Council—and we were known as aldermen in those days, not councillors—

         —Yes, it is a much nicer expression. I agree with the honourable member for Shortland. So in 1985 an opportunity was presented to us, there not being much provision of long day care centres in the community, particularly in regional Australia. There were preschools but not long day care centres. The Commonwealth government of the day was providing assistance, along with state and local government, through capital funding, to construct long day care centres.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The council decided at the time to provide the land and build two long day centres, one in Taree and one in Wingham. Interestingly enough, the Taree community based long day care centre was called Snugglepot and the Wingham community based long day care centre was called Cuddlepie. My second child, Prudence, at a very early age attended the community based long day care centre in Wingham. I was on the council steering committee that was managing both centres. Then we handed the management of those long day care centres over to a community based committee. There was still administrative support exercised by council, but the centres were managed by a community based committee.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        With that sea change, as it seemed, people in the community thought, `Shock, horror, we'll never manage this.' The income streams were the same. The support, as far as the attendance of children, was the same. But there went that safety blanket of having the local government body responsible for it—and, of course, from day one the council recognised that at some stage in the future the operational subsidy may not be there.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         So those long day care centres needed to be able to get themselves fairly commercially viable in the marketplace, as it were, establish a good reputation and get themselves through the accreditation process. But I make the point that, in changing from a management structure where a committee of the council was managing those two centres to a community based committee at arm's length from the local government body, just as many concerns were expressed then as are being expressed today about this current move the government is making with regard to community based long day care centres.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In the lead-up to the budget—we were assisted in heightening awareness of some of the possible changes by members of the opposition front bench—I received a lot of representations from people in the community about the operational subsidies. What were the majority of those representations about? They were about the operational subsidies for family day care.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I acknowledge that family day care with operational subsidies removed would collapse. Family day care provides a real alternative in the community for working families, single parents, who need those services. Without doubt the majority of representation I received prior to the budget about any changes to subsidies to child&amp;hyphen;care arrangements were with regard to the operational subsidy of family day care. We know that the government maintained the level of operational subsidy for family day care.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Community based long day care centres have moved on since 1985. Eleven years later they are operating on 50 per cent of the subsidy they used to and have gone through that process and managed very well. I have complete confidence in the management of the community based long day care centres I know about in my electorate that they will be able to manage this change.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         You will note in this package of legislation there is also $8.3 million being provided to assist community long day care centres to overcome the loss of the untargeted operational subsidy. When these centres were set up, from memory there was never any process gone through to target socioeconomically
         <break page="6468" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          disadvantaged sections of the community or sections within the community that provided that service.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is like so many other things that the government gets involved in in Australia. To kick something off, the government needs to be involved in it. We are such a large, diverse, remote country geographically with a small population and a small economy in relative terms. So in many instances the government has to start these institutions so we can get those services up and going, get a system in place, to the point where it can and should be able to stand on its own two feet.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The child&amp;hyphen;care cash rebate is still available to families in that income bracket who most need it, but the operational subsidy that was provided or is still provided to community based long day care centres was not targeted at any particular group. My daughter went to a long day care centre in my community. I was obviously not eligible to receive any child&amp;hyphen;care cash rebate but the subsidy the government provides partly subsidised that position.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is debatable as to whether the partial subsidy is $20 a week or $4 a week. There are all sorts of figures floating about. I am probably more inclined to accept the lower figure, but I am sure opposition members would run with the higher figure. But it was untargeted. The government is trying to make all assistance that is provided to the community generally more equitable and better targeted to the groups in the community who do need support. That is what this bill is all about.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Community long day care centres will no longer receive the untargeted operational subsidy. In order to manage this change a number of special measures will be introduced to improve access for families with additional needs and to assist the long-term restructuring of these services.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Government funding over the next four years for the child&amp;hyphen;care sector will include $526 million to retain operational subsidies for family day care, occasional care and outside school hours care; $31 million to support children with high levels of additional
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          need, particularly those with a disability; $12.5 million to ensure families in severely disadvantaged areas do not lose access to child care; $10.9 million to provide capital funding for new places under the targeted new growth strategy; and, as I mentioned earlier, $8.3 million to assist community long day care centres to overcome the loss of untargeted operational subsidy and to assist in that transition to restructure their financial management practices to accommodate these changes.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Bear in mind that community based long day care centres are not dealing with any overheads or servicing any loans to operate. Those facilities have been bought and paid for either by the Commonwealth or the state or, in our case, the local government body in the area. It will provide a more equitable service. I know there are detractors in here and out in the community who take issue with that being the case.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Interestingly enough, currently 200,000 or 70 per cent of children in child care are catered for by private operators, leaving the remaining 30 per cent subsidised by the government at an average of $20, although it would appear that generally only $4 of that figure has been passed on to the parents in fee relief. Bear in mind that child&amp;hyphen;care cash rebate for families earning below the threshold for the family tax initiative cut&amp;hyphen;offs will still be receiving that child&amp;hyphen;care cash rebate.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There will be a change for those above that level. The arrangements under the child&amp;hyphen;care cash rebate scheme will mean families with a taxable income lower than the family income cut&amp;hyphen;offs outlined in the family tax initiative, which is $70,000 for one&amp;hyphen;child families plus $3,000 for each additional dependent child, will have their benefit maintained at 30 per cent of their claimable child&amp;hyphen;care costs, while families with a taxable income greater than the family tax initiative cut&amp;hyphen;offs will be entitled to a rate of benefit of 20 per cent. I believe that is a fair measure.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         One other issue I wanted to raise, seeing as we are debating the provision of child&amp;hyphen;care services at the moment, is the issue of accreditation and the process of licensing. Although these measures that are being
         <break page="6469" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          introduced by the government address the untargeted nature of some of the subsidies, I believe there is still a need to address the licensing procedures that are in place. There are no linkages, to my knowledge, between the Commonwealth, who funds the places through fee relief, and the states, who actually license the building of new child&amp;hyphen;care centres.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There does not seem to be any research done in a community to establish need. The local government body in my area, the Greater Taree City Council, through their community development officer, Mrs Mave Richardson, undertook a study of the number of places available in that particular council area, the number of children attending child&amp;hyphen;care centres and the prospective number of children that are going to attend in the near future. They did that to get some sort of a handle on the need for new centres.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There was a fairly strong and sometimes bitter debate in the media over the approval of licensing and a building and development application approval for a new privately operated long day care centre in the area—obviously from other operators, both community based and private establishments as this was another private establishment.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Department of Community Services in New South Wales is only interested in the criteria it has laid out to establish a licence for a long day care centre; that is, the required qualifications of the staff per number of children there from nought through to five years. It will go ahead and issue a licence with no relativity to the need in the area and no relativity to the impact on the Commonwealth with the provision of fee relief. It probably makes the point that there needs to be a bit more research done in that area as well as stronger communication between the Commonwealth and the states in providing what is a much needed service in all parts of Australia. Otherwise, the industry can keep growing like Topsy.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The other issue I will quickly touch on is that of accreditation. There seems to be a lack of consistency across the board with some of the representatives of the department who undertake the accreditation inspections in my home state of New South Wales. Certainly, it
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          is a matter the minister may pay some attention to in that process to try to ensure that there is consistency across the board in the accreditation process for all child&amp;hyphen;care centres, be they private or community based. I just put that on the record as something that is very important. The previous government did implement an accreditation system, which I understand is still in place. It is certainly necessary, as far as the Commonwealth is concerned, to ensure that the child&amp;hyphen;care places the Commonwealth provides fee relief for are of a quality standard.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is interesting to note the history of the provision of the operational subsidy for community based long day care centres from 1972 right through until 1996. They have come from that position through to where we are today. As I said, when we changed the management structure of our two centres in the Manning in 1985-86, there were a lot of concerns. I took a very positive attitude at the time that the people who were going to be charged with the responsibility of managing those centres under the new structure then were quite capable of continuing to provide a good service under the system that was going to be implemented.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         For a couple of years I actually chaired the community based management committee that had the oversight of those two centres. Today I have confidence in the people that run those centres to adapt themselves to the changes we have before us this evening and to provide those services in those facilities to people in the community who do need that particular level of care. These measures are going to be better targeted to those groups in the community who need the support of the Commonwealth and the taxpayers of Australia rather than to some people who have had access to support from the Commonwealth but who we believe are at a level of income which takes them out of that category of those who deserve a level of support from the Commonwealth. I commend the bill to the House.

        Although community based child&amp;hyphen;care centres are located in urban and rural Australia, they make up by far the largest number of centres in rural and remote areas. Why? Because commercial operators do not see long day care centres in these areas as viable, and they are not. The operating subsidy received by community based centres is used to offset the greater expense of operating a long day care centre in these rural and remote areas.

        I am not as optimistic as the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile). The government's rationale is that the marketplace will deliver, that the playing field must be levelled to offer the same opportunities to private providers that are available for community centres. The level playing field has now reached the playground and again it is not level.

        Let me give the example of the Blinky Bill Portland Child Care Centre. Let me paint a pen picture of Portland, the town the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said gave him his first indication of the overwhelming win in the March election. This is an indication that remains a bit of a mystery to me since the town of Portland, hit by the closure of cement works, downsizing and privatisation of the electricity industry and the nearby Lithgow ADI factory, limited job opportunities and only the coal mines offering a valuable income, turned against both Labor and coalition in March and returned an Independent to this parliament because it felt that this local member understood the difficulties and heartache economic rationalism would bring to towns like Portland, whichever party took office. So a coalition member would certainly not be standing here tonight detailing the bleak outlook for Blinky Bill Portland Child Care Centre.

It believes the cuts will mean a funding shortfall of $40,000. It believes an increased fee of $25 a child per week will be necessary.

        Other amendments in this bill propose a partial means test on the child&amp;hyphen;care cash rebate.

In fact, the hardship provisions of this bill will not apply until the estimated income is below $15,646 per annum for a one&amp;hyphen;child family.

But, as I pointed out at the beginning of this speech, the loss of operational subsidies for council and community operated long day care centres is likely to have a dramatic impact on families at a time they can least afford it—that is, when there is no alternative child care available or likely to become available in rural and regional centres where the marketplace has failed to deliver and will not deliver. When you lose other services such as Tax offices and banks, the slow downward economic spiral is well under way. The only problem with child care, though, is that you cannot access it on a 1&amp;hyphen;800 line.

        The bulk of this bill I can accept, but I urge the government to revisit the amendments affecting long day care operational subsidies. The loss of these subsidies could not only spell the end of community child-care centres in some rural areas, including mine, but also exclude from child care some families who could well withdraw from the work force and become a further burden on the taxpayer or, worse still, withdraw their family from the town, so increasing that inexorable flow of population from small to larger centres.

         —The Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1996, which is before us, proposes the implementation of the following budget related measures. It proposes to discontinue the operational subsidy to community based long day care centres, to take effect from 1 July next year. Let me reiterate that long day care centres are centres that are open for at least eight hours a day during normal working days—that is, from Monday to Friday—and operate for at least 48 weeks of the year. The next measure is to reduce the child-care cash rebate from 30 per cent to 20 per cent for families with a taxable income in the current year lower than the family income cut-offs for part A of the family tax initiative, and that is currently $70,000 per annum for a family with one child.

        Community based long day care centres are the non-profit centres, as other speakers have said earlier in this debate. They are usually operated by a local government authority, a

        This method has benefits for the children, the community and the parents. The centres, I believe, are more responsive to the needs of the children and parents, with the parents being able to experience and observe the effects of any decisions they make or participate in. Again, it provides the opportunity for greater input by parents into decisions that can create a better level of satisfaction with the results of those decisions.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I turn now to the budget cuts and the changes in the budget. This budget cuts a total of $504 million from child care over the next four years. It will add between $14 and $20 a week to a parent's child-care costs in community based centres. That will take time to work through. This is a very clever budget. The cuts and the damage in the budget are cleverly staged but, nevertheless, they will hit. It is simply a matter of time as they work through.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The cuts take a variety of forms and include cuts to operating subsidies of $118.4 million over three years, benefits paid to families limited to 50 hours per week and reduced for second and subsequent children and, finally, a freeze being placed on the upper limit of benefits for the next two years. Community child care has carried a greater share of the more expensive areas of child care—that is, the care of the under two&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;olds, the disabled and the at&amp;hyphen;risk children. That is a fact that is readily acknowledged by everybody who is in any way involved with the child-care industry.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The removal of the operating subsidies to community child care attacks its future viability. Many community based organisations will not consider it feasible to continue operating a long day care centre without an operational subsidy. Remember, these are community based organisations and I have outlined the kinds of organisations that sponsor the formation of these centres.

         In my own electorate, it took quite some time for the councils, particularly the Lake Macquarie City Council, to become involved, to devote resources and to set aside a share of their annual fiscal resources to the operation of these centres. But, having done that, now the goalposts are being changed. The dilemma facing the councils will be how much of their resources they are prepared to devote to this area of activity, to this area of care.

        <para first-indent="16">
         The centres themselves are sometimes the only option for people living in regional or remote areas who need child care. We have heard that fact from the two previous speakers—one an Independent and the other a member of the government. The decline in the competitive role of community child care within the sector also means there is a greater chance of unchecked fee increases. One can argue very easily, as is apparent to many people, that removing the operational subsidy and thus forcing up the revenue that has to be raised by the centre itself indirectly forces them to increase their fees. It also indirectly makes it easier for the privately operated centres to compete with the community based centres regardless of the quality of service they are providing or of the segment of the market they are catering to.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Operational subsidies for community based long day care centres subsidise the cost of care for children who are expensive to care for, especially babies and children with special needs. The abolition of operational subsidies to these centres means that centres will have to charge higher fees—the fact I have just referred to—as much as $21 a week for a child under the age of three and $14 a week for a child aged three and over.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is all very well for government speakers and the minister to come back and produce some itemised amounts and present some hypothetical circumstances—they may or they may not—but inevitably the costs to parents who currently use these centres will rise if they are able to afford to keep their children there. That will happen, but it will also depend on whether the centre wants to continue caring for those children and babies with special needs.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The Howard government has said that it will provide a certain amount of money to help centres remain open in severely disadvantaged areas. But operators say that it will not be enough and that they will have to pass the cost on to parents. I come back to that point again: what this is about is pushing up the costs for parents who currently use those community based child-care centres.

         <para first-indent="16">
          The child-care cash rebate has been means tested. If you do not qualify for the family tax initiative, the rebate will be cut from 30 per cent to 20 per cent. So the rebate has been cut by some $34.7 million. The introduction of the child-care cash rebate by the Labor government recognised child-care costs as a work related expense. It recognised that child-care costs can be a significant disincentive for women thinking about taking up employment. Like other tax concessions for work related expenses, the rebate was not means tested.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          So, despite their promise not to means test the child-care cash rebate, the Howard government is in the process of imposing a means test on it. We are almost seeing a continuing cycle of broken promises. In each item that comes before the parliament, we are dealing with what this government promised in opposition and the alternative—what it is doing now in breaking those promises.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          Changes to the income test for child-care assistance mean that all parents will pay more for child care. The Howard government's so-called family budget cuts $282 million from child-care assistance. When we look at this in more detail, we see that 27,000 families will not get access to child-care assistance for more than 50 hours per week per child; 198,000 families will lose child-care assistance from tightening the definition of income for assessing eligibility; 30,000 families lose from the reduction in the income cut-offs for families with two or more children in care; and 650 families will get less help because of the inclusion of additional fringe benefits in the income test.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          So the budget freezes the child-care assistance and child-care cash rebate ceilings for two years, while allowing the minimum fee to continue to rise. The combined effect of this set of measures is that some 330,000 families
          <break page="6474" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
           expected to qualify for child-care assistance in 1996-97 will have higher out-of-pocket child-care expenses averaging about $4.25 per week. So, far from maintaining the level of child-care assistance, what is happening is that 330,000 families in this current year are going to be worse off to varying degrees.

But, because of this budget, long day care places planned to be built between now and the year 2000 will not go ahead, making it even more difficult to get quality, affordable care.

         —Labor in government had a long history of achievement in child care: the introduction of child-care assistance, the child-care cash rebate and operational subsidies for community based child-care centres. So many new places were provided during our period in government that child care became the highest employment growth category over the past five years. As a result, child care was much more affordable and available. When we came to office back in 1983 there were a miserable, paltry 46,000 child&amp;hyphen;care places. When we left office this year, that had grown to 270,000—a complete, stunning transformation.

       <para first-indent="16">
        When I was a councillor with the City of Coburg during the 1980s, one of our proudest achievements was being part of that transformation in making child care accessible within our own community. I personally had the honour of opening the Pascoe Vale Derby St Children's Centre—two or three doors from where I grew up and where my parents still live. We were also associated with the opening of the Barry Beckett Child Care Centre in Coburg East, the doubling of the capacity of the Shirley Robertson Child Care Centre in Coburg and many others. All along, we were making child care more accessible and more affordable and making it easier for women and sole parents to participate in the workplace.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Labor paid something of a political price for that. If we had had the participation rate in the work force of a generation ago, we would have had much less unemployment. Nevertheless, we were committed to giving women opportunities to work and to giving families options about how they arrange their affairs by making child care affordable and accessible.

         So you have to laugh when you hear the Liberal Party talk about families and how keen they are to help families when you look at the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill before the House tonight. This might be an old-fashioned view—and I know there has been quite a lot of debate about what constitutes a family—but from where I sit families mean children. Any government which is fair dinkum in the slightest about helping families would be saying, `We are going to help parents in ensuring that their children are properly cared for if they need to work for a living.' Let us face it, most of us do need to work for a living. We are talking about the battlers here, ordinary parents.

         I wish to draw to the attention of the House correspondence from the City of Moreland to the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) pointing out how this bill will impact on the City of Moreland and child-care funding within it. The letter makes the following point:

         Currently there are 27 long day child care centres and one Family Day Care Scheme operating within Moreland, providing a total of 1,473 effective full-time (EFT) places. Of these, fifteen are community managed services providing 644 EFT places.

        <para>
         With the changes provided for in this bill, all of that is in jeopardy. The council has urged the federal government to rethink its legislation. The response from the Minister for Family Services that they do not expect any child-care centres to be forced to close and that `there is no need for fees to rise at all if the inefficiencies in the community centres are eradicated' is both wrong and offensive to those involved in the management of those centres.

          It has already been reported that the Moreland Child Care Co&amp;hyphen;op, which has 25 places and which will lose between $25,000 and $30,000 a year in federal funding through this bill, and the Brunswick Child Care Co&amp;hyphen;op, which stands to lose some $37,000 per year, are involved in discussions about amalgama tion.

         But right throughout there is great concern amongst these child&amp;hyphen;care centres about the impact this bill will have on them.

Ms McCrow, a director of that agency, has indicated that it is going to hit low income families very hard; in other words, the battlers—precisely the point I made earlier.

         As for the Derby St Children's Centre, the centre director, Mandy Canham, has pointed out that it costs $150 a week for full-time child care and that 78 per cent of the centre's 54 families receive fee assistance. A parent who sends her child to that centre, Carol Knight, said:

         —One of the many destructive decisions in the budget was to reduce funds allocated to the parliamentary departments by $10 million a year from a total in 1995-96 of $142 million. One way in which this huge reduction has been accommodated is by combining the staff of committees of the House of Representatives and those of joint committees staffed through the House of Representatives so that one committee secretariat and staff service two committees. The total number of committee staff has been reduced from an already inadequate 76 to 68. The effectiveness of committees of the House is being further constrained.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The inadequacy of staffing has been exacerbated by the establishment of two substantial
        <break page="6477" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         new committees—Primary Industries, Resources and Rural and Regional Affairs and Treaties—though the impact of this has been significantly offset by the abolition of two standing committees on televising the House and on long&amp;hyphen;term strategies. Also, the standard committee membership has been increased from 12 to 14, which increases the complexity of arranging mutually convenient meeting and hearing times. The committees only began operating in June, so it is too early for all the consequences to be apparent, but some of the effects are already clear. The most important is simply that committee secretaries, and to some extent staff, have become schizophrenic, their attention being divided between the demands of two committees. Meeting and hearing times are restricted by those of the other committee.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The staff amalgamation will reduce the capacities of secretaries to be readily available for consultations with chairs and committees. Other cuts to the number of parliamentary support staff intensify the stress. The number of Hansard and printing staff has been reduced, increasing the amount of support work required of committee staff. Most importantly, all this will cause great pressure of work, particularly towards the end of inquiries, which occur simultaneously towards the end of parliamentary sessions. The heavy workload and stress at these times may well cause injuries such as RSI and the breakdown of health of some staff, as it has in other parts of the Public Service, despite attempts by management to prevent personal damage.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It will be necessary for committees to strictly limit the number of inquiries undertaken. It is quite likely that fewer public hearings will be held and probable that inquiries will have to be less comprehensive and reports less well researched. The funding cuts will also reduce the capacity of committees to employ consultants for technical aspects of inquiries. So the work of parliamentarians in committees is likely to be less effective.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The establishment of a comprehensive committee structure in 1987 was one of the significant achievements of the Labor government, undertaken following a caucus resolution and committee report which I moved and
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         chaired. However, the new committees have always been relatively poorly staffed. A relevant comparison is with another inquiry organisation, the Industry Commission. In June 1995 that commission had a budget of $25 million and a staff of 247 compared with the House committee funding of $4.3 million and a staff of 76. Yet in that year the IC produced 17 reports, on a generous definition of a completed report, and the House and joint committees for which the House is responsible for funding tabled 48 reports. There is a case for privatising the Industry Commission, which is now the Productivity Commission, so that it would contest the conduct of inquiries with other research bodies. This would significantly increase the diversity of advice available to government.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Department of the House of Representatives has commissioned KPMG to make an evaluation of the effects of the committee staffing changes beginning early next year. This will allow more time for the effects to become clearer. In the meantime, committee staff will continue to overwork, there will be some inconvenience and it is possible that the health of staff and the quality of work may suffer. So one of the best means of maintaining an effective communication between parliament and the community will be weakened and democracy will be undermined. This is damaging the effectiveness of the House.

         —Mr Speaker, as you are aware, I am fortunate enough to represent much of the beautiful Sunshine Coast area of Queensland. We have a long and very beautiful coastline on the Sunshine Coast. Our nation has one of the longest coastlines of any country in the world and also one of the largest exclusive economic zones of any nation. In fact, our coastline covers 36,700 kilometres and supports 86 per cent of Australia's population and much of our nation's commercial and industrial activity. In addition, the  exclusive economic zone represents some 11 million square kilometres of marine waters and their resources double the size of our land mass. The value of Australia's marine resources, according to
         <break page="6478" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">

        The executive summary of the state of the environment report released on 27 June this year highlighted the critical state of our environment and, irrefutably, the need for extra work to be done on the environment and the impact created by more than 200 years of European settlement. This report was prepared by over 200 independent experts and identifies major problems facing our environment, such as the soil erosion of agricultural land, degradation of waterways and loss of biodiversity. These problems must be addressed in an integrated and systematic way and will be as a result of the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill, which we passed through the House recently.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Specifically, the report does confirm that our coastline has suffered as a result of increasing urbanisation and population growth. Growth along the coastal areas is continuing at an unprecedented rate. In 1993 the coastal zone supported about 80 per cent of the Australian population, although around 70 per cent of Australia's coastline remains sparsely inhabited, which means that there are great pressures placed on local marine ecosystems.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The report also showed that the population of the non-metropolitan coastal zone is growing at an unprecedented rate—2.1 million to 4.1 million between 1971 and 1991. The Australian population in that period grew by only 32 per cent. The Sunshine Coast has shown a major growth. It grows at approximately six per cent per year. Over the next few years the population on the Sunshine Coast will grow to in excess of 300,000 people. That means that we have increasing pressures on our local environment. We need to address the major problem of urban dune encroachment and substandard effluent treatment.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The report I mentioned did indicate one area of particular concern and that is that coastal urbanisation has already destroyed much of the local ecosystem. Between 1974 and 1989, 33 per cent of the coastal bushland along the south&amp;hyphen;east Queensland coast was lost. From the coasts and clean seas initiative
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

        The electorate of Fisher is fortunate to have a number of national parks, two of them being the Bribie Island&amp;hyphen;Pumicestone Passage National Park and the Glasshouse Mountains National Park. Pumicestone Passage water quality, though, is not all it should be. Tree clearance in the catchment areas of the passage in the Glasshouse Mountains is the worst in the state. Along with the destruction of wetlands, it has resulted in environmental damage. We have a situation where something needs to be done. The Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Bill 1996 has passed through the House, and I would like to call upon the Senate to accept that we have a mandate to implement our policy and to pass that bill as well. We need to ensure that the environment that we pass on to future generations is better than the environment which we inherited. After more than 200 years as a nation we have nothing to be proud of. We inherited a continent with a pristine environment and, over 200 years, through successive governments, we have found that our environment has continued to deteriorate.

        The coalition government elected on 2 March is the only government to bring forward a detailed environmental package which will redress the 200 years of ignorance and neglect.

It is about time that they accepted that we have 76 Liberals and 18 Nationals, a total of 94 coalition members. There are only 49 Labor, of course, and they are going to seek through the Senate to reject our mandate. It is totally unacceptable. I would like to call on the Senate to pass this bill urgently.

On Friday night I had the great privilege of attending the Apprentice and Trainee of the Year awards arranged by the Newcastle Vocational Training Committee for apprentices and trainees throughout the Hunter Valley. I want to pay my tributes to the organisers of the function, to all those who took part, including the sponsors and the businesses involved, and particularly to all the prize winners. They were a very impressive group of people. My particular appreciation goes to Joanne O'Malley, who is the Trainee of the Year for the whole area. That is an impressive achievement, and Joanne is a very impressive young woman.

        The Apprentice of the Year award went to George Saloum, a 32&amp;hyphen;year&amp;hyphen;old motor mechanic from Macksville. Some years ago George was injured when he was hit by a tree. He was injured to such an extent that he was offered a disability pension. He fought against that and spent three years recovering. Through Nambucca Valley Skillshare, one of the great success stories of the skillshare scheme, he happened to meet Bob Lindsay of Big Bob's Car Care at Macksville. He eventually became an apprentice. He is 32 years old, has three children and he is the Apprentice of the Year. That is a terrific story. It certainly was an impressive night. I extend my best wishes to all the young people who took part, particularly the winners of the overall awards.

        The second matter I wanted to mention relates to an incident that occurred on 6 May 1986 when a young woman was pushing a cart of coins up a ramp at a branch of the Commonwealth Bank. She slipped and was pinned to the wall by the cart. It was a minor incident in an otherwise happy and successful life, but that incident was to lead to a 10&amp;hyphen;year nightmare. The nightmare ended on 23 August when that young woman and I appeared before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to appeal against a decision by Comcare, which claimed that the injury that had plagued her since that time was not work caused.

         doing and what its responsibilities are. In this particular case, the tribunal did such things as send the woman to a doctor without producing the report. Despite the fact that the report was about the woman's medical situation, Comcare chose to keep it secret. This is not a private organisation; this a publicly funded body with a duty of care to people. In this particular case they failed their duty most dismally. In the Administrative Appeals Tribunal they refused mediation. They produced a doctor, a solicitor and a barrister against a young woman who could not afford any of those.

        The hearing before Senior Member Allen was a difficult one because neither the young woman nor I had ever been to a hearing there before, nor were we used to the processes that are involved, which are extremely intimidating. At the end of the day Senior Member Allen found in the woman's favour and upheld her appeal. In other words, an individual has been taken through the process by a government agency which spent a vast amount of money to try to deny her what was eventually judged to be her right. Senior Member Allen was both courteous and understanding of the situation, unlike Comcare, which was not.

        Mr Speaker, as a result of that incident and that experience, I am in the process of seeking assistance from your staff to draft a private member's bill proposing that legislation affecting Comcare be changed to allow people to appeal to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal as a first appeal level. The fact that when the organisation makes a decision the only appeal available is to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal through an extensive and complex legal process is inappropriate and unreasonable. The private member's bill will seek to amend legislation so that the first level of appeal will be the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. It is a much more human and more personal service, and I am sure it will give a much better result.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This action would not have been necessary if Comcare had adopted a process of mediation and other processes that were fairer and more reasonable. They chose not to do that, therefore the act must be changed to make

No thanks are due to Comcare for the fact that her appeal was upheld, and no thanks are due to Comcare for their duty of care, which was noticeably absent in this particular case. I trust that when my private member's bill comes forward the House will support this proposal.

         —On Sunday, 27 October I attended the annual picnic day in Broken Hill. It was an event of great success due to the 500 volunteers who took part, the 80 community groups, the 60 business houses and, not least, the 8,000 or 9,000 citizens who participated. But I want to bring to the attention of the House this evening the memorial service that was held there to honour those 704 miners who have lost their lives on the Line of Lode, that famous ore body that has given Australia and the world immense wealth since it was first mined in 1883. I remind the House that another 1,500 have died outside the accident rate on that mine from other ailments such as dust on the lung.

        Seven hundred and four people over the course of a little over a century is an average of nearly six or seven a year who were dying for the benefit of this country.

I am pleased to bring this to the attention of the parliament.

        What words can we use to describe such an immense loss of life? We are not talking about five people, 10 people, 20 people, 50 or 100, but 704 people. In per capita terms, it is equivalent to a loss of life in excess of 80,000 in Sydney, and that is not even including the 1,500 who died outside the accidents on the mine.

        Today the population of Broken Hill has shrunk from 33,000 at its peak to about 24,000 today and the mining community is down to 800. The life of the mine will probably be 10, 12, 15 years, depending on metal prices, exchange rates, industrial arrangements and so on. This town has given us immense wealth over the last century in exports, royalties and better mining methods. It has founded the most famous company we have in Australia today—BHP—and it has given us a resilient spirit which has contributed to the essential Australian character. It is sad that Aboriginal claims around the town are hindering a full exploration effort to keep mining going in that town. It was great indeed to be able to attend the miners' memorial service, and I pay tribute to all those who have lost their lives on the mine over the last century.

         —I rise to add some further comments to the grievance debate speech I gave on 28 October about the decision announced in the Australian Taxation Office Business 2000 statement that the Bankstown Taxation Office will close in the period after 30 June 1998. The final decision completely overturned the draft report recommendations for the Bankstown Taxation Office to be retained and for its staffing to be increased from 644 to 800. This decision crushes the very real expectations of the individual taxpayers and small business people of Bankstown that the ATO presence in Bankstown would be enhanced.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This decision means that the local small businesses in Bankstown, dependent upon ATO staff spending their money in their stores to keep up their profitability, will be put under even further financial pressure. This decision means that the ATO's policy of regionalisation and decentralisation of its offices and services is directly threatened not just in Bankstown but elsewhere.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This decision means that all the ATO's clients in Bankstown will be disadvantaged in terms of their access to the full range of services which was so readily and efficiently provided in Bankstown by the Bankstown Taxation Office. This decision means the contraction of ATO services in Bankstown and the contraction of the local economy. This decision means that Bankstown's individual taxpayers will be put to considerable expense and to a considerable waste of time because they will have to go to ATO offices at Parramatta or Hurstville to deal directly with ATO staff on matters relating to their tax affairs.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The coalition government wants to abandon direct service provision by the Commonwealth Public Service and to drive towards those functions being provided by the private sector through outsourcing. The tremors of this drive are already evident in the ATO Business 2000 document. The overview of accommodation argues that:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The difference between current best practice of around 15 square metres and our existing holdings is the equivalent of 1,200 staff.

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Put another way, if we were to accommodate our existing staff at 15 square metres, we would need an average 8 fewer buildings than we currently have.
       </para>
       <para>
        And, ominously, the document argues that:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Into the new century our major leases expire and, with the benefit of our new experience over the coming years, we will be freer to develop new directions.
       </para>
       <para>
        That can mean only more job losses and more taxation offices closing: a centralisation, concentration and contraction rather than decentralisation and regionalisation, where a full taxation office service is provided at the community level.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The Australian Taxation Office envisages that, after the year 2000, it will have more flexible accommodation management arrangements. It will use external expertise in strategic management of accommodation holdings and its accommodation standards will be consistent with comparative industries. In all, the ATO sees accommodation as a major business expense. The implications of this viewpoint are that the ATO will decrease both its staffing levels and its regional accommodation after 2000. More jobs will be lost and more government services moved away from the individual taxpayers and industries it is meant to serve.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        After the year 2000 we can expect greater contraction of ATO services, greater job losses and a rapid move away from the decentralisation and regionalisation of the past decade. This will be at a greater direct cost to individuals dealing with the tax office, which, having caught the gist of the National Commission of Audit and this coalition government's drive to make the people pay, expects that `the user&amp;hyphen;pays concept is common practice in the Australian Public Service for non-core activities'.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This drive towards a contraction of services and to the outsourcing of services from the Australian Taxation Office directly links in with what it perceives to be the drive of this Commonwealth government under the coalition towards putting pressure on the Australian Taxation Office to cut its staff numbers, to cut its accommodation and to cut its direct services to the public. It states specifically
        <break page="6482" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         that it expects that the government is contemplating a smaller, more competitive Public Service, that the government has made an in&amp;hyphen;principle decision about outsourcing IT—

         —A matter of grave concern to the people of my electorate was raised in this House today. I am gladdened by the discussion in which the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) agreed with me and my constituents in Hughes on the importance of exploring a further possible site, particularly Goulburn, as Sydney's second airport.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        My colleagues on this side of the House will recall that on 21 May this year I requested that an EIS be undertaken at Goulburn at the same time as the EIS is undertaken at Holsworthy in my electorate. I attend many public rallies on this issue. An airport at Holsworthy is the consuming concern of my constituents and I am often asked: why Holsworthy when it was ninth on the list of airport sites back in 1985? Why are we not looking at other sites? Why are we not looking at Goulburn?
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        With the topic of very fast trains in the media over recent weeks, the prospect of Goulburn presents a very real possibility to my constituents. Not only have the people of Goulburn reportedly expressed a desire to have an international airport located within their vicinity, but the development of very fast transport does lend a good deal of sense to a proper investigation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I have heard arguments that Goulburn gets fog bound, but so too does Holsworthy. I have heard that the cost and difficulty of delivering the necessary Avgas to Goulburn is great. Yet since 1976 we have had a natural gas pipeline from South Australia which delivers gas to the people of the city of Sydney. With modern technology it is anticipated that as early as 2009 natural gas will be piped from Western Australia to the eastern states. So already in Australia the technology exists to transport gas over very large distances.

         I am totally and utterly opposed to any idea that a 24-hour international airport might be located at Holsworthy and so are my constituents. My position on this issue is all the more difficult because in taking such a stand one is against those on my side of this House for whom I have respect, high regard and even warm affection.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Perhaps my position may not be conducive to a successful career in this parliament. But I did not come here for my career; I came here to do a job. I am mindful that I am here and that my colleagues now sit on this side of the House because of the faith of all the people all over Australia. But the people of Hughes also had faith for the first time since 1969, when the present boundaries for the seat of Hughes were created. The people voted for this government.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There is a heavy sense of betrayal, heavy enough to be tangible, angry enough to be expressed in unrelenting protest and it exists in my suburbs in Hughes. After all, we did make certain promises to all Australians before the last election. `For all of us,' we said. `For families,' we said. But my constituents are families too. These are substantially residential suburbs where mums and dads and young couples have invested their lives and their financial security in their homes and in their communities.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         We promised for all of us. Yet my constituents are the only people in all of New South Wales who are bearing the burden of the prospect of an international airport. The bushland, environment and green spaces of these suburbs will be detrimentally affected if an international airport is located in their backyard. It is grossly unfair and it is obscenely unfair. There may never be an airport at Holsworthy, but the hardworking families in the suburbs of the west of Hughes already have lost at least $20,000 from the value of their family home, which in the majority of cases is the only asset that they possess.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Ten years ago a decision to investigate Holsworthy would have made good sense, but today there has been significant and substantial extension of residential development in
         <break page="6483" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          the area. Over 500,000 people now have their homes here. It is also a fair observation that, had the Labor Party shown any political will and clout and completed Badgerys Creek years ago, none of us would be faced with this dilemma today. For today, the air quality and the water quality of the Sydney basin is shown to be under the increasing stress of the intensification of human habitation and activity.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It is bad planning, bad policy and even bad politics to place an international airport in the midst of one of the fastest growing residential areas of Sydney. This may be an exercise in hard&amp;hyphen;core economic reality, but it leaves little room for people in its ultimate outcome. Such a proposal is an abomination to family life. It would be a shattering experience to the families in my electorate, and I totally reject it.

        <para first-indent="16">
         I fully understand that the airport at Sydney is also a shattering daily experience for the people of Sydney, but is it a solution if, in trying to correct one unbearable situation for one group of people, life is made unbearable for others? The people of my electorate see merit in many of the matters raised by the member for Prospect and, with respect, I believe such matters ought properly be explored.

       (1)(a) and (b) The Department of Treasury and Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Productivity Commission have been involved in work on the subject of competition policy in international fora. Treasury and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been involved in discussions of these issues in the OECD and APEC fora. Discussions in the WTO context are at a very preliminary stage. The interrelation between trade and competition policy encompasses such issues as considering how ineffective competition policies hinder market access, the effect of divergent competition laws on global business transactions,, the impact of trade remedies on competition, and the importance of competition law enforcement assistance. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has begun consultations with industry to ascertain its views on the potential  trade and economic benefits to Australia and, in particular, on the issues requiring further work. In 1995, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade published a paper on these issues
       <break page="6486" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        entitled, `Trade and Competition Policy: A Survey of the Issues'. The Productivity Commission has undertaken analysis of the implications for Australia of the completion of the Uruguay Round, and of the commitment to free trade required under APEC. In September 1996, the Productivity Commission published a paper entitled `International Cooperation on Competition policy: An Australian Perspective'. It noted that a greater commitment to competition principles (including removal of tariffs) by APEC economies could raise Australian real income by over 6 per cent in the long run.

       (2) The Government is participating in discussions on competition policy in the WTO and APEC fora. It is in Australia's interest to support continued work in the trade/competition policy field. Australia has a `world class' competition policy, and efforts to improve competition policies and laws of other countries are likely to benefit Australia through increased access to overseas markets. The Government strongly supports the exposure of regional markets to greater competition, including through implementation of competition policy principles.

        (1) Neither the financial nor the economic viability of the Inland Marketing Corporation's (IMC) Parkes freight airport proposal have been established. At my request the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform is currently conducting an Air Freight Review Inquiry which includes consideration of opportunities to improve the efficiency of Australian exports, particularly perishables, through enhancing Australia's air freight services. The Inquiry is specifically investigating the need for, and viability of, additional international aviation infrastructure to cater for regional needs. Opportunities for improved coordination and linkages in the export air freight chain are also being considered. The IMC has made a number of submissions to the Inquiry and the Committee is aiming to finalise its work and report to Parliament by the end of 1996.

       Yes. The level of a provisional tax uplift factor for a year of income after the 1996&amp;hyphen;97 year of income, depends on the degree of positive change of a later calender year gross domestic product (GDP) over an earlier calender year GDP. These are the main factors in the formula in subsection 221YAAA(3).
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">
       Where the percentage degree of change of the relevant years' GDP is less than six per cent the formula provides for the provisional tax uplift factor also to be less than six per cent. Under section 221YAAA, the only time the figures produced by the formula will not be used is where the figure is negative. In this situation, the provisional tax uplift factor is zero per cent.
