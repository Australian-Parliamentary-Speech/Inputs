He learnt from his mistakes but it was too late. Last year in May he went back to the court and ask for permission to do his licences and the judge granted him and said to him Australia needs people like you who works hard. He was getting his license and 1 week later the Border force enters our house and took him to Villawood Detention Centre until now. Life has been hard since we lost our son and for him been away from us for over a year is heart breaking especially with the kids as they grow up without their dad.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The current definition of 'dependent' in the 1958 Migration Act does not account for the practical realities faced by young adults, particularly those on student visas. Once a child turns 18, the regulations disregard the ongoing dependency on parents for housing, food, and other support, even though the actual level of dependency remains unchanged. This inconsistency is particularly evident when compared to other visa types, where dependency considerations are more flexible. This disparity creates unfair hardships for young adults who continue to rely on parental support while pursuing their education.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's parent visa system is significantly more costly and time-consuming compared to other OECD countries, creating unnecessary barriers to family reunification. The Contributory Parent Visa costs AUD 48,895 with a 14-year processing time, while the non-contributory Parent Visa takes up to 31 years. This is in stark contrast to the US, where similar visas cost USD 535 and take 12-24 months to process, and Canada's Parent and Grandparent Super Visa, which costs CAD 1,080 with a processing time of 20-24 months. The UK processes parent visas in 12 months for GBP 1,523. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This highlights the immense financial and emotional burden on Australian families. The prohibitive costs and lengthy waits deny families the need of being together, forcing them to miss out on milestones or be absent for parents at times of urgency. Reducing these barriers will demonstrate the Australian government's commitment to humanitarian values and support for families. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">From an economic perspective, having parents nearby can significantly reduce childcare costs for both families and the government and allow families to better balance work and life. This enables skilled migrants to contribute effectively to the workforce, improving productivity and participation rate.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A more humanitarian parent visa policy, aligning with international standards, will foster a stronger community and enhance Australia's competitiveness in attracting global talent as skilled migrants are more likely to settle in countries supporting their family needs.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">A bill would allow Australia to implement deverse streams of supply of important derivatives that are in high demand such as gelita from animal waste , this would reduce the demand on producers of livestock and help reform slaughter houses which are constantly unable to cope with high production rates and demand. New technologies already within Australia are being used in the production of human supplements through the technique of isolation from plants and synthesis. A bill could supplement farmer's incomes and create the ability for cropping in area's currently not suitable for certain crop's enabling land owners or those interested in Agriculture to invest in supplementry or renewable Agricultural crops. Cropping in coastal regions for example ware water quality requires water purification techniques or natural osmosis aiding land owners too meet specific targets for example subsidizing crop gell from flaxseed if fewer animals were produced in times of drought or disease. Infitting with renewable energy water purification from wells that may not be fit for livestock but suitable for growing cropps for example. Also when land fails to meet husbandry standards for livestock it can be regenerated through understanding new technologies introduced through the bill such as isolation and synthesis through crop rotation.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">We petition the House of Representatives to address the growing threat of online radicalisation and anti-semitism. In an era marked by the proliferation of misinformation and disinformation, it is imperative that we take action to protect our society from the dangers of radicalisation and anti-semitism. The internet, while a powerful tool for information and connection, has become a breeding ground for extremist ideologies. Individuals, particularly vulnerable youths, are being lured into radical beliefs through sophisticated online propaganda. This not only threatens our national security but also tears at the fabric of our multicultural and inclusive society. We call upon the House of Representatives to implement comprehensive de-radicalisation strategies, which should include:—Education and Awareness: Develop educational programs that promote critical thinking and digital literacy, helping individuals to discern reliable information from harmful propaganda.—Community Engagement: Strengthen community programs that foster inclusion and provide support networks for those at risk of radicalisation.—Collaboration with Tech Companies: Partner with social media platforms and tech companies to monitor and remove extremist content swiftly and effectively—Research and Development: Invest in research to understand the root causes of radicalisation and develop innovative approaches to counter it. By taking these actions, we can safeguard our citizens, uphold our values of tolerance and respect, and ensure that Australia remains a beacon of democracy and peace.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small"> we, the undersigned, are deeply concerned about the ongoing high interest rates that are making life increasingly difficult for everyday citizens. The struggling to make ends meet, with many resorting to working two or even three jobs just to cover basic living expenses. High interest rates have placed a significant burden on individuals, families, and businesses alike. The consequences are far-reaching and include: </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">*Unaffordable Housing and Loan: the cost of borrowing has skyrocketed, and making it nearly impossible for people to afford home, cars , or even education. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">*Struggling Small Businesses: Local businesses the backbone of our economy, are finding it increasingly difficult to operate, expand, or hire due to the cost of credit. This turn, leads to higher prices for consumers, perpetuating the cycle of economic hardship</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As interest rates is high or continue to rise, the economic divide widen, The middle class is shrinking, and the working class is slipping deeper into poverty. The current economic policies are unsustainable and unfair, leaving ordinary people to bear the burnt of decisions made without their well- being in mind.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The scammers act with a sense of urgency and also keep the victim in the phone so they family members can not intervene until it is too late. </span>

Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is on the list on the NDIS, of usually accepted conditions, yet PsA is the same pathology as RA, except PsA is asymmetric and effects the long bone joints eg knees,, and RA is easier to diagnose, symmetric and effects the small bone joints, eg fingers and PsA can cause many more complications than RA for example erosion of new bone formation, Enthesitis, and Axial involvement (sacrcilac joint, spine). This shows that if RA is accepted 'by the nature of the condition', then surely the same condition but worse should be accepted as well. The 'management and treatment ' is even the exact same for both, even though PSA is more rare than RA. The fact that funding is limited is not our responsibility either, we Australians will this terrible condition deserve the help we need. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">With increasing prices almost everyday from both suppliers and supermarkets it has become impossible to maintain a cafe business. There is no gst applicable to 95% of purchases from supermarkets yet everything we sell we have to pay gst on. With wages, rents and electricity going up there has been no concessions for small cafe businesses. We are in an industry where fast and efficient service is necessary as most purchases are made by patrons on the way to somewhere else. In order to provide that service we must have adequate staffing and in order to keep staff we need to offer them adequate hours. It has become simply impossible to navigate and many owners work 7 days/week. If we don't keep costs down we lose customers as the cost of living is already a burden on the everyday family. Throw in theft, repairs and replacement of equipment and there is simply nothing left at the end of the day. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Nicaraguan president Daniel Ortega took power in 1979 to 1990, and again since 2006 after overthrowing the Somoza regime. The rule of Ortega and the Sandinista National Liberation Front has been plagued by corruption and human rights abuses, as democracy has continued to decline. A notable facet of this regime has been the suppression of academic freedom, characterised by the closures and control over universities, and imprisonment of scholars and academics. One case of particular concern is that of Freddy Quezada, former professor, who was imprisoned after expressing dissent for Ortega and his government.</span>

We urge Penny Wong to publicly advocate for the reinstatement and funding of forcibly closed Nicaraguan universities, and to push for Ortega and his Government to legislate on the protections of academic freedom. We ask the House to impose trade restrictions on Nicaragua until a commitment to academic freedom is made—and demonstrated—by the Nicaraguan Government. </span>

There are other extreme fetishes such as Feederism where an online or in person feeder likes to be in the control of a human becoming morbidly obese or many at the same time which also can lead to the control of ones finances which can be a form of domestic violence on its own.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Many aged care and disability support workers use a Meal Entertainment Card credit card in their salary packaging arrangements. The ATO says this increases their take-home wages by decreasing the tax they pay as it increases their tax free threshold. Those cards can only be used to pay for meals at cafes and restaurants. The salary packaging amount allowed to go on those cards was almost unlimited in the past, but now it is limited to just $2,650 per FBT year. To help boost customers at cafes and restaurants, and to effectively help boost the wages of aged care and disability support workers, please double their Meal Entertainment Card salary packaging maximum limit to $5,300 per FBT year. Calculated per week, if they choose that new higher limit, that would equate to four meals per week they can buy for their families using that Meal Entertainment Card credit card in their local communities. This benefit will quickly increase the number of customers visiting cafes and restaurants, while also increasing the money-multiplier effect directly within those local communities. To increase the financial benefits within Australian communities, the Meal Entertainment Card credit card should also be geocoded limited to use within Australia only.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The proposed Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2024 poses a serious threat to the freedom of speech of Australians, and the stability of Australian democracy. 40 years after the famous book 1984 is set, this Bill wishes to commemorate the anniversary by implementing a real-life Ministry of Truth. This Bill empowers the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) to fine and penalise companies that operate digital and social media platforms. The power to decide what is 'true or false' should not be in the hands of the ACMA. Such powers could also, in effect, infringe upon the implied freedom of political communication within The Australian Constitution. Penalising digital and social media platforms for content posted by Australians is an indirect way of restricting Australians' freedom of speech. For the flourishing of Australian democracy, Australians must not be restrained by broad and overbearing legislation which this Bill intends to do. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">In April 2022 our daughter Katrina (48) was driving home to Sydney on the NSW Snowy Mountains Highway. The driver of an oncoming empty, double stacked, B-double logging semi-trailer hit a pothole/trench measuring 1.7 metres x 0.8 metres. His speed was 99kms (not illegal). He was speaking on a citizen band (CB) radio, holding it in his right hand near his face (not illegal). His in-cab video shows him dropping the CB when he hit the pothole, completely losing control of his semi-trailer. Too late, he then placed both hands on the wheel. His vehicle crossed over into Katrina's path. His trailers jackknifed, pushing her vehicle 145 metres violently backward and eventually into the elevated roadside embankment. She was killed on impact. Her legs were trapped inside her vehicle and her body was flung out onto the road as her vehicle's seat belt mechanism and chassis were completely destroyed. Hand-held mobiles are rightly prohibited. Inexplicably hand-held CB radios are a legally permitted driver distraction. Mandating usage of hands-free CB radio legislation Australia-wide, could reduce life changing injuries and deaths on Australian roads. Drivers using CB radios travel Australia-wide. Legislation governing all drivers using CBs within Australia is required. We implore the Commonwealth Government to influence States and Territories to amend legislation to allow only hands-free CB operation. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Firstly, inflation and rising vehicle prices have rendered the current thresholds outdated. Higher production costs due to global supply chain disruptions also contribute to increased vehicle prices, making the existing thresholds of $76,950 and $89,332 insufficient.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A new threshold would promote environmental sustainability by making fuel-efficient vehicles more accessible. Vehicles with advanced technologies, which are more expensive, would become affordable without excessive taxation. This would also align with international standards where countries provide tax relief for eco-friendly vehicles.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Raising the threshold would also ensure fairness across vehicle types Larger family and rural vehicles, essential for specific needs, would no longer be unfairly taxed. Moreover, modern safety features and technological innovations in cars are now standard, not luxury, so the tax needs to reflect that shift.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Increased thresholds will help stimulate consumer spending ,benefiting the automotive industry while also reducing the tax burden on middle-income earners who are disproportionately affected by the current LCT.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, updating the definition of luxury to reflect actual market realities will ensure that vehicles classified as "luxury" are truly high-end, rather than just practical or environmentally friendly cars that exceed outdated limits.</span>

But most of these cases are against other men and not women. in recent weeks and months there has been quite a few cases where Females have been the perpetrator, yet there has been not ONE single mention of the term DV when reporting in the media, WHY? We need to stop this type of labeling as it is my belief it contributes to hate and anger something we seem to be getting good at in this country.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Organ trafficking is a broad international problem encompassing many countries around the world where those in vulnerable positions have their organs unlawfully and unethically removed for transplantation. This is most prominent in China where the millions of prisoners of conscience incarcerated are murdered-on-demand for organ transplantations. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">We believe that the Migration Amendment (Overseas Organ Transplant Disclosure and Other Measures) Bill 2023 is an important first step in preventing and eradicating organ trafficking as it requires those entering into Australia to declare if they have had an organ transplant overseas in the last 5 years, and if so in which country, state and medical facility.

Their homes and businesses have been looted, vandalized, and set ablaze. Nine lives were lost, and 69 places of worship were attacked, desecrated, and burned. Currently 20 million religious and ethnic minorities are living in fear, with limited options: emigrate, convert, or face death.

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Kings highway the Murray River is becoming worse every year for navigation . This should be the Governments responsibility to maintain a navigable channel as per the original agreements made between the states in 1915 where there are locks on the river from goolwa through to Mildura. Tourism is suffering and vessels no longer able to go between a lot of the towns on the river. Vessels from SA could not get to Wentworth for a steam festival so much needed revenue for the upkeep of our heritage vessels is lost. Emergency services are being called out to rescue stranded vessels and it is only a matter of time before some one gets injured or worse with several call outs a month happening. This is during our normal river levels with pool levels at the locks in a normal height. It is no longer adequate just to advise of shallow sections and look away. There are literally only a dozen or so spots that need timber groins reinstated and some dredging done .We the undersigned demand action on this matter urgently. Captain Michael A J Polson</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 6 August 2024, on behalf of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Petitions, concerning Petition EN4501 on the strengthening of data protection laws.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government acknowledges the impact that data breaches can have on individuals, and the importance of the protection of personal information. It is vital that Australia's privacy laws properly protect our personal information, and that they keep pace and align with global standards.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Strong privacy laws are essential to Australians' trust and confidence in the digital economy and digital services provided by governments and industry. Australians have a right to have their privacy respected, and when they are asked to hand over their personal data they have a right to expect it will be protected. On 12 September 2024, I introduced into Parliament the Privacy and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2024. This Bill would legislate a first tranche of reforms to bring Australia's privacy protection framework into the digital age, and includes stronger enforcement powers for the Australian Information Commissioner.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill builds on the Government's <span style="font-style:italic;">Privacy Legislation Amendment (Enforcement and Other Measures) Act 2022, </span>which commenced on 13 December 2022 and was introduced in response to the large-scale data breaches of 2022. This Act significantly increased the maximum penalties available under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Privacy Act 1988 </span>(Cth) for serious breaches of privacy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will continue to advance proposals on a second tranche of privacy refo1ms, to ensure the Privacy Act strikes the right balance between protecting people's personal information, and allowing it to be used and shared in ways that benefit individuals, society and the economy. The Government will undertake targeted consultation with stakeholders most affected by these proposals.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information is of assistance.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 6 March 2023 to the former Minister for Home Affairs, the Hon Clare O'Neil MP, regarding a proposal to list the Islamic Republic of Iran as a terrorist organisation. As the issues raised fall within my portfolio responsibilities, your correspondence was referred to me for reply. I apologise for the delay in response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has been active and consistent in publicly condemning Iran's egregious behaviour, including its brutal repression of protests, extensive use of the death penalty, systemic persecution of women and girls and destabilising regional actions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has taken meaningful action to hold the Iranian government to account for this conduct. The Government has imposed sanctions on 200 Iranian-linked individuals and entities since Iran's violent repression of the 'Women, Life, Freedom' protests in September 2022. Australia was at the forefront of efforts to successfully remove Iran from the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women. We also co-sponsored and advocated for the United Nations Human Rights Council resolution that established an independent investigation into human rights violations in Iran.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government considers it wholly unacceptable for any foreign government to target members of our community in ways that prevent individuals exercising their fundamental rights and freedoms in Australia. The Government regularly engages with communities, state and territory governments, police and national security agencies to build public awareness of, and resilience to, the threat of foreign interference. Australia's law enforcement and intelligence agencies assess, investigate, disrupt and, where possible, prosecute acts of foreign interference.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For an organisation to be listed as a terrorist organisation under Australian law, it is required to satisfy the legislative criteria set out in Division 102 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Criminal Code Act 1995 </span>(Criminal Code). As a nation state, the Islamic Republic of Iran is not the kind of entity that can be listed as a terrorist organisation under the Criminal Code.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is committed to its international obligations set out in the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, and other international human rights conventions to which it is a party. Australia does not return individuals to situations where they face persecution or a real risk of torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, arbitrary deprivation of life or the application of the death penalty.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Any person who wishes to seek Australia's assistance, and believes they meet the requirements, can make an application for a humanitarian visa. Each application is considered on its individual merit using current and comprehensive information on circumstances in the relevant country and Australia's Humanitarian Program priorities. Consistent with the approach adopted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Australia will prioritise people who are outside their home country and have the greatest resettlement need.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I have copied this letter to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator the Hon Penny Wong, and the Minister for Home Affairs, the Hon Tony Burke MP.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for bringing your concerns to the Government's attention. I trust this information is of assistance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 1 August 2023 to the former Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon Andrew Giles MP, enclosing Petition EN5146, with 101 signatures, concerning immigration and housing. Your correspondence has been referred to me as the matter falls within my portfolio responsibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government released the Migration Strategy ("the Strategy") in December last year. A key objective of the Strategy is building stronger Australian communities by better planning the migration intake. This will better connect skilled migrants to Australia's skill needs, helping to reignite productivity growth, which will ensure rising living standards, business growth and better wages. Student visa reforms in the Strategy will restore integrity and quality to the system, and ensure international students are not being exploited.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Strategy includes a number of measures that will assist to return Net Overseas Migration to pre-pandemic levels, allowing Government to manage migration levels while also ensuring the Migration Program is focused on getting the right skills in the right places.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In respect of impact on housing, around 60 percent of visas under the permanent Migration Program are granted to migrants already onshore and in the community, residing in established households at the time of visa grant. This minimises the permanent Migration Program's near-term impact on housing, infrastructure and services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is also working to address housing shortages through significant investment in the Homes for Australia Plan, which aims to build 1.2 million new homes from 1 July 2024. Further information can be found on the Treasury Department's website at: https://ministers. treasury.gov.au/ministers/julie-collins-2022/media-releases/homes-australia-plan-delivering-more-homes-australians.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has a long-standing position of support and respect for international law and is firmly committed to its international obligations.

The AFP is a statutory agency operating independently of government and outside the political process, and as such, it would not be appropriate for the Government or the Parliament to intervene in investigative decisions.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to delivering lasting and enduring reforms to aged care that will benefit older people for decades to come. The new Support at Home program will better support older people to remain independent, in their home and community for longer.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government introduced the Aged Care Bill 2024 for a new Aged Care Act (new Act) to Parliament on 12 September 2024. Subject to parliamentary processes, the new Act is expected to commence from 1 July 2025, aligned with the new Support at Home program.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 7 August 2024 regarding petition EN6242 requesting legislation that allows older people to have the right to self-manage their aged care services and that reports made by workers are only shared with relevant workers delivering the same service types.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Government is committed to supporting older people to have choice and control over their aged care services and to live with dignity and respect. I appreciate the concerns raised in the petition about the privacy and autonomy of older people receiving Australian Government-funded aged care services and their right to self-manage their services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I recognise that older people have different preferences and needs for their care. That is why we are implementing a range of reforms including the Support at Home program and Statement of Rights in the new Aged Care Act which outlines an individual's rights to exercise choice and make decisions that affect their life. Providers of Government-funded aged care services will be required to demonstrate they understand the Statement of Rights and have practices designed to deliver services in accordance with the Statement of Rights. These reforms will make aged care services more person-centred, flexible, and responsive to older people's goals and preferences.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to finding the right balance between enabling older people to self-manage their services and ensuring that they receive appropriate care and support that meets their needs and preferences. Under the new Support at Home Program, older people will continue to have the option to self-manage including designing, directing, and making decisions about their Support at Home services and how they are delivered.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">However, self-management does not mean that older people are left without any oversight or support from the Government or service providers. An appropriate level of regulation is essential to ensure the quality and safety of aged care services and to protect older people from abuse, neglect, or harm. You can find further information on the Support at Home Program at www.health.gov.au/our-work/support-at-home.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is concerning to read that some service providers are insisting on sharing the personal information of older people without their informed consent. The final draft of the strengthened Aged Care Quality Standards (Quality Standards) contain clear expectations about respecting older people's choice and privacy and how to manage their personal information, in particular:</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission will play a key role in monitoring and enforcing the quality and safety of aged care services, including the Quality Standards, regardless of if the services are self-managed or not.

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 12 August 2024 to the Minister of Social Services, the Hon Amanda Rishworth MP concerning Petition Number EN6275—Parents of Deaf Children (PODC). As the matter raised falls within my portfolio responsibilities, your email has been forwarded to me for reply.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government funds a range of programs offering support for people with disability and for providers wishing to offer disability services. Funding through the Information, Linkages and Capacity Building (ILC) program is for one-off competitive grants to deliver projects in the community that benefit all Australians with disability, their carers and families. It is important to note that ILC funding is time-limited and ongoing funding is not available through the ILC program.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Department of Social Services (the department) recently conducted 2 open competitive grant rounds under the Social and Community Participation (SCP) and Individual Capacity Building (ICB) streams of the ILC program. The SCP grant opportunity opened for application from 25 August 2023 to 6 October 2023, with funding of $50 million over 2 years.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">On 3 May 2024, outcomes for the SCP grant opportunity were announced. The ICB grant opportunity opened for applications from 7 September 2023 to 30 November 2023, with funding of $90 million over 3 years. Applicants were advised of the outcomes on 23 May 2024 and the outcomes were publicly announced on 5 June 2024. Both grant opportunities were oversubscribed.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note that PODC applied for both grant opportunities and were unsuccessful. This was due to the number of highly competitive applications received by the department.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The ILC program is also being considered as part of the recommendations handed down through the Independent Review into the National Disability Insurance Scheme (the Review). The final report of the Review was released on 7 December 2023 and can be found on www.ndisreview.gov.au. The Review considered the ILC program, and proposed a number of improvements and changes as part of a wider system of supports termed Foundational Supports.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 6 December 2023, National Cabinet agreed to design additional Foundational Supports to be jointly commissioned by the Government and the states and territories. My department has commenced working with other government agencies and state and territory officials to map existing services and define policy parameters in preparation for engaging with the disability community including people with disability and their representative organisations, and service providers.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 12 August 2024, enclosing Petition EN6282, with 52 signatures, concerning immigration and housing. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A key objective of the Strategy is building stronger Australian communities by better planning the migration intake. This will better connect skilled migrants to Australia's skill needs, helping to reignite productivity growth, which will ensure rising living standards, business growth and better wages. Student visa reforms announced will ensure only genuine students and education providers have access to Australia's world class international education sector.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The size of the permanent Migration Program will decrease by 5,000 places in 2024-25 to 185,000. The reduction to the size of the program delivers on the Government's commitment to carefully manage migration levels while also ensuring the Migration Program is focused on getting the right skills in the right places. Around 60 percent of visas under the permanent Migration Program are granted to migrants already onshore and in the community, residing in established households at the time of visa grant. This minimises the permanent Migration Program's near-term impact on housing, infrastructure, and services.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Migration Strategy, released on 11 December 2023, outlined the Australian Government's vision for getting migration working for the nation and building a migration system that delivers for workers, businesses and all Australians. It outlined a suite of broader structural reforms aimed to ensure that our most highly skilled international graduates drive long term prosperity by transitioning to permanent visas as soon as possible. Key objectives of the Migration Strategy are to build stronger communities and reduce migrant worker exploitation by reducing the number of migrants who are permanently temporary.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Lowering the age eligibility from under 50 to 35 years or under for the TGV supports the wider objective of reducing 'permanent temporariness' and repositions the visa as a product for early career professionals who can contribute to the Australian economy over a longer period. This change applied from 1 July 2024.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is important to note that the TGV is not the only visa available to highly qualified graduates. These graduates continue to have access to other temporary and migration pathways, some of which are being enhanced as a part of the visa reforms.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government released the Migration Strategy ("the Strategy") in December last year. A key objective of the Strategy is building stronger Australian communities by better planning the migration intake. This will better connect skilled migrants to Australia's skill needs, helping to reignite productivity growth, which will ensure rising living standards, business growth and better wages. Student visa reforms in the Strategy will restore integrity and quality to the system, and ensure international students are not being exploited.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Strategy includes a number of measures that will assist to return Net Overseas Migration to pre-pandemic levels, allowing Government to manage migration levels while also ensuring the Migration Program is focused on getting the right skills in the right places.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In respect of impact on housing, around 60 percent of visas under the permanent Migration Program are granted to migrants already onshore and in the community, residing in established households at the time of visa grant. This minimises the permanent Migration Program's near-term impact on housing, infrastructure and services.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence regarding petition EN6533, which requests that the term 'honourable' is no longer used to refer to Members.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Using the term 'honourable' to refer to members of the Australian Commonwealth Parliament is a tradition derived from British parliamentary practice. The term is used to show respect for the institution of parliament, which Members have been elected to serve.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While Members are collectively referred to using the general term 'honourable Members', for example when the arrival of the Speaker is announced at the beginning of each sitting, members of the Executive Council (Ministers and Assistant Ministers) are formally granted use of the title 'Honourable' upon their appointment, and are entitled to use this title for life.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information is of assistance to you.</span>

Several of the petitions being presented today express a desire to improve a situation for people who live in other countries. For example, one petition relates to concerns held for minority communities in Bangladesh, and another relates to academic freedom in Nicaragua. Other petitions cover aspects of the current conflict in the Middle East, with one also requesting support to address antisemitism within Australia.</span>

Also included are requests to release the sealed findings of the Royal Commission into the Robodebt Scheme; to reverse the approval for Melbourne Airport's third runway; and to release an individual from immigration detention. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:03</span>):  On behalf of the Standing Committee on Procedure, I present the committee's report entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Maintenance of the standing and sessional orders</span>, together with the minutes of proceedings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inquiry into the maintenance of the standing and sessional orders has become standard practice each parliament. It provides an opportunity for the committee to consider how the standing and sessional orders have operated over the parliament, the functioning of the House and what could be improved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report makes five recommendations, including on matters specific to this parliament as well as issues considered in previous Procedure Committee reports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were several changes made to the standing orders at the start of this parliament, including the introduction of sessional order 65A, which enables crossbench members to receive the call in accordance with the relative size of the crossbench this parliament. The committee considers that this sessional order outlines a sensible approach that has worked well and has recommended its adoption as a standing order that is updated at the start of each parliament to account for the membership of the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Relatedly, given the increase in the number of divisions called with between four and 10 members on one side this parliament, the committee recommends amending standing order 127 from 'four or fewer' to '10 or fewer' members on one side. We think that this change will support a more expeditious and efficient parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Committees play an important role in the work of the parliament. However, the committee heard that some members of parliament are stretched thin over several committees. A member could more meaningfully contribute to their committee work if they served on fewer committees. Accordingly, we have recommended that the House consider reducing the number of committees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee also considered the evolution of the Federation Chamber since it was first introduced 30 years ago. In our view, minor cosmetic changes wouldn't help to enhance the status of the Federation Chamber for members and the public without adding significant additional costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the report recommended revisiting some recommendations from the committee's report <span style="font-style:italic;">A window on the House </span>regarding question time. The committee has drawn on this comprehensive report, tabled in 2021 by the Procedure Committee—including the then chair, the member for Bonner, Mr Ross Vasta MP, and the then deputy chair and member for Oxley, now Speaker, the Hon. Milton Dick MP—and has revisited some recommendations that have not been implemented by the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the committee I would like to thank members who made a submission and who met with the committee to express their views, experiences and insight on areas for improvement. I'd like to conclude by also thanking the deputy chair, the member for Bonner, and his fellow colleagues, as well as colleagues on my side of the chamber, for their collaborative approach to the consideration of these matters. I commend the report to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Victoria's Otway Basin is a 500-kilometre-long stretch of sea floor that is, in places, 5,000 metres deep. In recent years the Otway Basin has repeatedly been subjected to seismic blasting—a significant environmental insult which has been insufficiently regulated and monitored by successive federal governments. This private member's bill aims to halt the issuing of special prospecting authorities, or SPAs. These are licences issued at nominal cost to overseas companies to enable their repeated, uncontrolled and essentially unsupervised seismic blasting of our unique and irreplaceable marine environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Seismic blasting blasts the sea floor with high-powered air guns every 10 to 15 seconds, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for weeks or months at a time, to map offshore oil and gas reserves and to identify sites for carbon capture and storage. These blasts reach more than 250 decibels. They can be louder than the detonations of atomic bombs. They injure and kill marine wildlife.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the northern end of the Otway Basin, the Bonney Upwelling pushes cold water onto the coastal fringe. This attracts an extraordinary variety of sea life: blue whales, southern right whales and humpbacks, pigmy whales, orcas, dolphins and porpoises. All are sonar dependent cetaceans which can be rendered helpless by the violent sound pollution of seismic blasting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Blasting also destroys zooplankton and phytoplankton. It endangers food sources for the whole marine ecosystem. The fishing industry is vital for the Colac Otway community. It reliably sees decreased catch rates of commercially fished species, including rock lobster, crab and tuna, after blasting has occurred in the area. On one occasion whiting catch rates at Lakes Entrance during local seismic testing fell 99.5 per cent, while the flathead catch declined at the same time by 71 per cent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Community members from Kooyong—and beyond—have come to me with their concerns over the extent and repetition of ongoing fossil fuel exploration off our coast. In recent years, tens of thousands of Australians have rallied, petitioned and made submissions regarding their opposition to repeated seismic blasting of our oceans. In Victoria, communities have been concerned about two particularly egregious proposals for seismic blasting in the Otway Basin. One from TGS/SLB Schlumberger involved over 77,000 square metres and two Commonwealth marine parks. It was the subject of more than 30,000 complaints to the toothless offshore regulator, NOPSEMA. Almost 20,000 of those complaints were from supporters of the Australian Marine Conservation Society. Thanks to concerted campaigning by AMCS and by other community groups, that proposal was recently cancelled, but CGG is now seeking an SPA permit for blasting just off the coast of Warrnambool. This is a southern right whale migration route zone. It's a zone for Australian sea lion feeding grounds, and it's where little penguins forage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">SPAs are additional to the usual government releases of coastal seawaters for oil and gas exploration. They bypass the government scrutiny and the community consultation which is required for offshore title releases. For the derisory fee of $8,250, companies can gain approval to blast a seabed site for up to 180 days at a time. There is little, if any, supervision of their activities. The permits can be renewed multiple times within a single exploration project. When it considers SPA applications, NOPSEMA doesn't have to look at the past conduct of the proponents (including any of their possible criminal breaches). It doesn't have to look at their financial capacity or their experience. Every application is assessed in isolation. The past or cumulative effect on ocean health of blasting projects is not considered at the time of permit approvals. Also excluded from consideration is the effect on Aboriginal cultural heritage sites—on sea country. This approach is negligent of ecological, environmental and cultural concerns. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Seismic blasting is undertaken for three reasons: to find oil and gas under the seabed, to identify potential sites for carbon capture and storage, and to assess the effectiveness of any carbon capture and storage projects. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Oil and gas developments produce harmful emissions. They have the potential for catastrophic blowout or spill. They employ few locals and they send our profits—and our energy—overseas. This government should commit to no new oil and gas projects. It should not permit speculative exploration for them, with its concomitant ecological and environmental costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Carbon capture and storage remains an illusory means of offsetting carbon emissions. It has never achieved its target at scale. It is a risky technology, firstly, because of its false proposition of emissions reduction, which is used as a justification for locking in the continued extraction of fossil fuels, but also because there are risks from carbon capture and storage itself. In a marine setting, dissolved carbon dioxide leaking from sub-seabed sites acidifies water. This asphyxiates marine life. Aquatic ecosystems are also threatened by the physical disturbance of drilling, of laying pipelines and of seismic events, subsidence and displacement of aquifers during or after CO2 injection. Sea dumping is aquatic vandalism. It is the more shameful for its secrecy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our environmental protections are grossly inadequate when, for a derisory fee, an area of seabed the size of Tasmania can be made available to overseas firms for a speculative form of environmental vandalism. This is a process which inflicts auditory violence on our marine life. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of Australia want no new fossil fuel projects off our beautiful coastlines. We implore the government to accept this bill to abolish Special Prospecting Authority permits. It would be an important step towards protecting our marine life, our coastal communities, our fishing industries and the health of our oceans. I commend it to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:14</span>):  I second the motion. Seismic testing is not new, but its application in the marine environment is increasingly controversial and disputed. As is often the case, in recent years more research has been undertaken to more closely examine its effects, and I acknowledge that still more research is needed. However, evidence is now emerging that seismic surveys are having a damaging effect on marine life, with recent studies by IMAS in the Bass Strait north of my electorate showing severe impacts on scallops, with up to four times higher death rates and a range of other sublethal effects, including altered behaviour, impaired physiology and a disrupted immune system. Likewise, research by IMAS has shown that seismic blasting is having seriously damaging impacts on rock lobster populations both in the Bass Strait and in Western Australia, and on krill populations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Much of the opposition to the practice is now coming from the fishing industry, who are joining community and conservation organisations, which have shown there is a declining social licence for more social blasting—and the SPA permits that are attached to them—in our ocean, and that it is time for reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we've heard, special prospecting authorities are a quick and cheap way of bypassing the usual annual permit, and they don't consider that cumulative impact of multiple projects on ocean ecosystems and marine life. Companies are not assessed as to their fitness and proper standing, or their criminal history, as part of the decision-making process, because of exemptions under section 695YB of the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act. This means also that companies who are being investigated for breaching the conditions of a previous SPA aren't excluded from applying the new permits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Data collection companies can sell the survey data they collect from seismic blasting conducted under an SPA permit on the open market to anyone prepared to purchase the data, and the information is held by the company owning the data for up to 15 years as commercial in confidence, which is one of the reasons why we see so many companies bidding to conduct seismic blasting over the same areas within a year or two of each other, double dipping on profits by collecting the same mapping of what lies below the sea floor, at the expense of marine life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A moratorium on seismic blasting in our oceans, in keeping with the recommendation of the 2022 <span style="font-style:italic;">Making waves</span> Senate inquiry report, is needed, and urgent action should be undertaken to reform this system to remove the 15-year commercial-in-confidence clause and make all seismic data available to be reprocessed and available on the Geoscience Australia site, removing the need for more seismic blasting exploration projects in our oceans. It is time to press pause and take another look. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flynn</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:25</span>):  I'm very happy to second the motion put forward by the member for Nicholls with respect to the Requiring Energy Infrastructure Providers to Obtain Rehabilitation Bonds Bill 2024 and how it will make provisions for the rehabilitation, the decommissioning and the disposal of renewable energy projects Australia-wide. There are some big questions over the future of renewable energy: who is going to rehabilitate the land, who is going to dispose of the materials and who is going to make sure that those moneys are available at some point in time in the future? The big question is: what will it all cost? I would suggest that it will be an enormous amount of money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will use some figures that we know of in the construction of these projects as an example. Lotus Creek Wind Farm up in central Queensland is a proposed wind turbine farm. It is a $1.3 billion project. It is 46 turbines; 46 into $1.3 billion is approximately $28 million per turbine. These companies are fragmenting the last big stands of remnant vegetation up and down the east coast of the Great Dividing Range in Queensland. So the questions are: what will it cost to dispose of that, to rehabilitate it and to re-establish that? I would suggest that it will amount to billions, and there is absolutely no guarantee that the companies that are putting forward these projects will even exist in 20 to 25 years time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill goes some way to addressing those issues. We know that there are some 21,000 wind turbine projects that are proposed and are under some form of scrutiny from both state and federal governments as we speak. If you take a nominal figure, given the $1.3 billion Lotus Creek project in Queensland, and just use a nominal figure of $20 million per turbine, we're talking in the vicinity of half a trillion dollars to establish wind turbines alone. So the big question is: what will it take to pull them all down, dispose of them and rehabilitate the land? The numbers are enormous. In Queensland, we know that all of these projects, wind and solar and so forth, are attached to the land tenure of the people that control the land. So the question again is: will these people that have accepted responsibility and accepted payment for these things be held to account?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are questions that have yet to be reasonably answered. This bill proposed by the member for Nicholls goes some way to addressing those issues into the future, and I fully support the bill.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Amendment (Making Gambling Businesses Accountable) Bill 2024, will ensure gambling companies are held accountable for the misery they inflict on thousands of Australians, by preventing them from profiting from illegal behaviour. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Quite simply, the bill puts a positive obligation on gambling companies to report to AUSTRAC if they have reason to suspect a person is paying for a gambling service with money they've obtained illegally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where a gambler has paid for a gambling service using funds they did obtain illegally, the bill enables the Federal Court to order the gambling company to compensate the injured party for damage or loss suffered. This will prevent gambling companies from profiting from the misfortune of others, and facilitate a remedy for the victim of the original theft.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians continue to be the world's biggest gambling losers per capita. Indeed, according to the latest figures from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, Australians lose more than $25 billion each year on gambling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And it's getting worse, particularly online, with data in the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs report—<span style="font-style:italic;">You win some, you lose more: </span><span style="font-style:italic;">o</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nline gambling and its impacts on those experiencing gambling harm</span>—suggesting that participation of Australians in online gambling increased from 12.6 per cent in 2010-11 to 30.7 per cent in 2019. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Moreover, recent survey findings from the Australian Gambling Research Centre show that around three-quarters, or 73 per cent, of Australian adults gambled at least once in the past 12 months, and almost two in five, or 38 per cent, gambled at least weekly. And, among those who gambled, 46 per cent were classified as being at risk of gambling harm in just the past 12 months. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The figures of gambling addiction are well documented and well known. But it's important not to forget the human impact that gambling addiction has. Indeed I've heard countless stories from people right around the country about the toll it has on people's finances, relationships, employment and mental wellbeing—and in hundreds of cases leading to suicide.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And of course gambling addiction is second only to drug addiction as a reason for crime, which is where this bill comes in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill was developed in consultation with Gavin Fineff, a former financial adviser who defrauded 12 of his clients, stealing amounts ranging from $60,000 to $745,000. In total, Gavin lost $8 million, including $3.3 million of his clients' money, through gambling, and he is now in jail serving a nine-year sentence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, Gavin understands he did the wrong thing and takes full responsibility for his actions. But he is not the only one to blame considering the predatory behaviour of three of Australia's largest betting companies, who cynically exploited Gavin's gambling addiction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First there was Tabcorp, where Gavin was quickly promoted to VIP status, assigned a personal customer service manager and offered special treatment, including events, experiences and bonus money to bet with.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And no wonder, because Gavin was gambling and losing big time. Indeed, from September 2016 to June 2018, there were 194 times when he deposited $10,000 or more into his TAB account, and 23 times when he made a withdrawal of more than $10,000 from his account, 10 of which were for $50,000. But, as Gavin continued to lose money, and more and more money, rather than offering him support, Tabcorp fuelled his growing addiction with bonus money and tickets to sporting events to encourage his gambling. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And all the while Tabcorp never intervened. They never asked Gavin for proof of funds, never asked for proof of income, and never showed the slightest interest in where all the money was coming from. When they finally did intervene, it was of course too late, and Gavin had lost almost $4 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But then, in proof that the industry is systemically and culturally rotten to the core, just three weeks after Tabcorp froze his account, Gavin was contacted out of the blue by representatives from Ladbrokes, who offered to sign him up with a 'superior experience', including thousands of dollars in bonus bets. When Gavin disclosed that his Tabcorp account had been frozen, the Ladbrokes representative facilitated an account under a false name. He was never asked for identification nor, again, asked for any proof of income.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But that wasn't to be the end of it, because then along came BetEasy, which has now merged with and is part of Sportsbet. A few months after signing with Ladbrokes, where he had lost close to $700,000, Gavin was contacted, again out of the blue, by gambling company BetEasy, who set up an account for Gavin and gave him $50,000 in free bonus bets, which he lost within the space of 45 minutes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the next 16 months, Gavin lost approximately $3.6 million with BetEasy. And, again, BetEasy never asked him for proof of income and only checked his identification in the last two months of his gambling with that company.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Which brings me back to this bill, and the undeniable fact that these companies knew, or should have known, that Gavin's gambling was suspicious. Yet they deliberately targeted him for his addiction. That should be a crime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And what about the victim's money?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Two of the companies have kept all the stolen money they received from Gavin, and one of the companies gave just a portion back to the victims—which is obviously not acceptable, but which is all the evidence we need to show that gambling companies should be required by law to return the stolen money to the victims and that the Federal Court should have the power to order them to do so. Constructively, this is a view shared by several Independent colleagues in the states and territories who are progressing similar bills in their parliaments and assemblies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In other words, change is coming and the parasites in the gambling industry need to get out of the way, while the Labor, Liberal and National parties need to get on board. Anything less will just go to show how the industry really are parasites, and how the government and opposition really don't give a toss about gambling addiction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now invite the member for Mayo, who is seconding this bill—for the third time, I would add—to contribute to the debate in my remaining time.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:36</span>):  I second the motion. I commend the member for Clark for never giving up on this issue, despite what has often been a very disappointing response from several governments. Australians now lose $32 billion every year—more than any other nation on a per capita basis. Many vulnerable members of our community are now having gambling shoved down their throats through aggressive marketing—and we're not doing anything about that either.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ABC reported in July 2024 that, before being convicted of stealing $400,000 from her employer to feed her gambling addiction, Carolyn Crawford, age 64, had never had so much as a parking fine. She was jailed for 18 months. Had the operators been required to undertake due diligence, they may have ascertained that her income was insufficient to cover such losses or at least to compensate her employer. Apparently, three-quarters of women in prison with Carolyn are also there as a result of gambling addiction. What a waste!</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Existing laws make it an offence to deal with money which a recipient ought reasonably to have suspected to be in the proceeds of crime. However, existing regulators have been slow to use their powers to claw back proceeds of crime from those who benefit. This bill, the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Amendment (Making Gambling Businesses Accountable) Bill 2024, imposes an obligation on gambling companies to notify AUSTRAC if they suspect a person is paying for a gambling service with money obtained illegally. If they do not, the Federal Court will be able to order the company to compensate for the injured party's loss. That will at least give those harmed some sort of recourse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are still waiting for the government to properly respond to the recommendations under what we all know as the Murphy report. Nineteen months after it's handed down, we still appear to be no further. I truly commend the member for Clark on this bill and all the work he has done in this parliament and parliaments before with respect to gambling harm. With gambling companies, we know that they should have known both in the case of Gavin Fineff and the case that I just spoke about that the funds that were being gambled were the proceeds of crime. How come, in every other aspect, we go very hard on those who benefit from the proceeds of crime but we don't seem to do that with gambling companies?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A year ago, I stood in this place and introduced my Lobbying (Improving Government Honesty and Trust) Bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last year, little has changed for the good in the halls and chambers of this place. Trust in government continues to fall. The public believes us less and less. The major parties seem to work together only when colluding against their rivals. Democracy is under threat globally in what we acknowledge is a post-truth world. We can combat cynicism and disbelief only by committing to openness—to a radical form of transparency. In the words of Woodrow Wilson, our government should be all outside—no inside. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a democracy, the right of bodies to make representations to government—to have access to,<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>and an impact on<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>policymaking—is fundamental to the proper conduct of public life and the development of sound policy. However, lobbying activities lead to corruption if they prompt decision-making which is not merit based, honest and transparent. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The existing federal Lobbying Code of Conduct aims to ensure that contact between lobbyists and government representatives is conducted in accordance with public expectations of transparency, integrity, and honesty. The code is toothless. It has failed. It's too limited, it does not engender transparency, and it's unenforced. Nothing has changed that in the past 12 months. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Commercial lobbying is a multibillion-dollar industry in Australia. The public register applies only to third-party lobbyists—paid professionals engaged by clients to influence public officials on their behalf. It does not include in-house lobbyists—those employed within an entity purely to undertake that role. So, it applies to only 20 per cent of the lobbyists roaming our corridors, knocking on our doors, seeking to influence our decisions. The other 80 per cent? Who knows. The register, as it stands, doesn't include company executives, NGOs, not-for-profits, charities, think tanks, research centres, religious organisations, trade unions and other bodies. On 17 November 2024, the register included 727 third-party lobbyists; about 40 per cent were former politicians, ministerial advisers or senior public servants. So, given that that's 20 per cent of the lobbyists in this place, we know that there are well over 3,500 lobbyists regularly walking the halls of the Australian parliament. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to regulate lobbying for three main reasons. The first is to prevent corrupt behaviour by lobbyists and public officials—cash for access, cash for comment, cash for approvals. The second is to ensure fairness in decision-making by stopping secret influence by vested interests. The third is to ensure that all government decisions are honest, transparent and merit based. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Enforcement of lobbying codes in this country has been dismal. The current code meets only one of the 10 principles for transparency and integrity in lobbying set down by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Suggestions that the code be better enforced have been actively rebuffed by successive governments of both stripes. We need an independent regulator administering a strong legislative scheme—not a complacent and conflicted government waving an administrative framework with the cohesion and effectiveness of a wet tissue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia remains behind the United Kingdom, Canada, and the US—they've already legislated strong integrity frameworks, the power of which includes their scope; post-employment restrictions; penalties; independence of the administrative entity; and transparency of monitoring and public reporting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of those are addressed in this bill. It includes provision for a new, publicly accessible online lobbyist register, which will include all lobbyists. It requires lobbyists to lodge online quarterly returns reporting who they've met with, for how long, where, and why. Ministers will publish their diaries online too, so we can cross-compare and verify reporting. The bill mandates a longer post-employment prohibition; ministers and senior staff would be banned from working as lobbyists for three years after they leave parliament. It would legislate a register of senior government appointments—so we know who is working where and when, both during and after their time in this place. At this point we have no open record of senior government appointments in Parliament House. The bill would regulate enforceability. It would include fines and bans for lobbyists who breach the bill. Rather than a self-regulated code bedevilled by intrinsic and systemic conflict of interest, the code would be independently enforced by the independent integrity commission. It would be a code in which Australians could trust. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We must hold public officials to a high standard of integrity. When they leave public office, officials shouldn't be able to use insider knowledge for personal gain or for the commercial benefit of their new employer—and they shouldn't be making decisions prior to leaving office which might advance their employer-to-be. And yet we have seen, time and time again, the revolving door—the golden escalator—between this House and industry, with ministers and public servants accepting lucrative private sector jobs with unseemly haste immediately upon leaving parliament. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sunlight is the best medicine, and it is time to shine a light in the halls of this place—to illuminate the workings of the 'light on the hill'. We need to know who has the ears of our politicians, and we need to stop Canberra's revolving door. Australians deserve to be able to trust their government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this 47th Parliament, the Albanese government has not brought a single private member's bill to this House for debate. I hope that this will be the first. This bill is an important contribution to the restoration of integrity and transparency to this place. I commend it to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HAINES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:47</span>):  The motion is seconded. I'm proud to second this bill from the member for Kooyong today, to bring transparency to lobbying practices in federal politics. Lobbying is all about influence, access and advocacy. On the face of it, that shouldn't be a bad thing in politics. It's an expected part of the work of MPs, governments and stakeholders to seek to advocate for special policy responses for investment in programs or infrastructure. But where it becomes a problem is when people seek to exert undue influence, to use special access to get those results, particularly in ways which subvert decisions in favour of particular interests, in contradiction of the public interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We already have some measures in place to keep track of lobbying efforts, as the member for Kooyong says, but these are piecemeal and provide no actual transparency when it really matters. As the member said, the existing lobbyist register lists 727 registered lobbyists, but they're but 20 per cent of the actual number of people who walk these halls. It doesn't include those who are internal lobbyists, government relations officials and others. More than 2,000 people hold orange lobbyist passes, giving them access to this building. That's many, many more than the 727 on the register. And that's just one example of the massive gap between what we know and what is actually happening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Lobbying (Improving Government Honesty and Trust) Bill 2024 would help fill in the gaps in what we know. It would mean we have much better visibility over lobbying activities that are occurring right now. We would know who gets unfettered access to this building—the people's building—and who is giving them that access. We would know who ministers are meeting with and when they're meeting. We would know who is influencing those decisions before those decisions are made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It would also stop the revolving door between lobbying and government, preventing former ministers and their staff from becoming lobbyists for three years after leaving the parliament, to stop that special insider knowledge that is then used for measures other than the public good. This is a vital part of the integrity framework we need to strengthen our democracy. Too often, we're left questioning whether the decisions made by those in power are made for the right reasons. Is it a decision made or not made because of who's had the minister's ear, or is it being made truly in the public interest? I want to have faith that decisions are being made properly, but too often I and the general public are left with nothing but doubt—and doubt fosters mistrust. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to strengthen our democracy. The member for Kooyong has given us a solution; let's debate this bill and clean up politics in Australia. </span>

In my electorate of Indi, I've heard from a family of five on two good incomes crammed into a two-bedroom unit. I hear from key workers—in teaching, healthcare or construction—who can't take up vital jobs in our regions because there's simply nowhere to live. We know young couples right across Australia are putting off having children because of the lack of affordable and secure housing. The situation in the regions is dire.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By listening to my community, to local governments, to builders and developers, I know that a major barrier to building new housing is the lack of critical enabling infrastructure. This means the sewerage, water connections, electricity poles, roads and footpaths that must be built before houses can even begin to go up. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not shiny, but it's critically important.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I'm introducing my fair share for regional housing bill today. We must amend key housing legislation to ensure regional communities get a fair share of housing funding. We need to give local governments and utilities companies a bigger, fairer, slice of the pie—because without them the builders, developers and community housing providers simply won't be able to build the houses we need in regional Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill amends the Housing Australia Act 2018 and the Housing Australia Future Fund Act 2023 to specifically address the regional housing crisis. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, my bill amends the objects of Housing Australia and the HAFF. It adds that an object of Housing Australia—and a function of the HAFF—is to address the housing needs of people in regional, rural and remote Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, it requires the minister to scrutinise the action needed to ensure Housing Australia distributes at least 30 per cent of its funds—including through the HAFF—to projects in regional, rural and remote Australia. The minister would also have to table in the parliament reports on how it has complied with this requirement—ensuring we all know whether the government is doing enough for regional Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, it makes it absolutely clear in the legislation that both local governments and utility providers are eligible for HAFF funding and should be supported by Housing Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourthly, it would increase transparency by requiring Housing Australia's annual reports to set out the amount of funding distributed to each state and territory, to each council and water corporation, and to each area of regional, rural and remote Australia. We need to get eyes on this. This will give the public line of sight on exactly where Commonwealth housing funding is going. Because right now, we simply can't see it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fifthly, the bill ensure critical enabling infrastructure is eligible for HAFF funding. This bill will do that. The current legislation does not make this clear—so I'm making sure that it is clear that housing funds can build the supporting infrastructure that unlocks homes close to where people work, live and study. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, my bill requires the statutory review of the HAFF to consider how the HAFF has met housing needs in regional, rural and remote Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is needed, because the government and the opposition are too focused on the cities when it comes to the housing crisis. Regional communities risk being left behind, and I won't have it. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will equip regional Australia to tackle the housing crisis head on—to build the homes that will support our regions for years and decades to come. With more well located and affordable housing—we can attract the workforce we need and ensure everyone has somewhere to call home. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">SHARKIE</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:58</span>):  I second the motion for the member for Indi and am very pleased to support the Housing Legislation Amendment (Fair Share for Regional Housing) Bill 2024. Around one in four people live in regional Australia, and accordingly it is appropriate—it's necessary—for our policy settings to reflect the population distribution across our nation. One would expect that, if public policy were written with this logic, the regions would have legislative consideration commensurate with our representative population; sadly, this is not the case. All too often, regions are given very little consideration. In fact, most of the time, we're not really considered much at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the context of housing, the importance of rectifying this imbalance is particularly appropriate. Vacancy rates in some of my regions are as low as 0.4 per cent, considerably lower than the city and inner suburbs. Construction or upgrades to infrastructure necessary for housing developments takes more time in the regions and is typically more expensive. Many of the amendments tabled by the member for Indi have been discussed in this place before, and I commend the member's persistence in advocating for a fairer share of Australia's resources being allocated to the regions. Ensuring proportional expenditure in the regions, as laid out in amendment 1, is sensible and reasonable, as are the requirements of amendments 2 and 3 to report the amount and proportion of distributed funding to regional and rural and remote Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amendments 4 to 12 to the Housing Australia Future Fund Act address the current shortfalls and inequities in the act. These include identifying regional, rural and remote Australia as a group within the act; clarifying critical and enabling infrastructure for social and affordable housing—and that's really key; affordable rental housing, as the member for Indi mentioned, with respect to childcare workers; adding regional housing as the forth purpose in the act; and requiring the minister or Housing Australia to specify funding for regions when publishing information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So much of public policy in this place is very much city centric and east coast centric. We need to lift our eyes and we need to recognise that one in four Australians live outside of the cities, outside of the suburbs, and they deserve to have public policy that addresses their needs too.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The objective of the healthy kids advertising bill is to protect our greatest resource—our children—from the harmful impacts of junk food advertising.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If implemented my bill would restrict junk food advertising from appearing on TV, radio and streaming services between the family viewing hours of 6 am and 9.30 pm. It would also introduce an end to all paid junk food marketing on social media and other online environments. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today's children consume multiple types of media, often simultaneously. Some spend more time in front of computer, television and game screens than in any other activity other than sleeping. It's extraordinary. Twenty-four per cent of Australian children spend more than 20 hours a week watching TV or online. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Children have a remarkable ability to recall the content of the advertising that they see. They develop product preferences after as little as a single exposure to one ad. This strengthens, though, with repeated exposures. Ads affect what kids ask their parents to buy. They affect what we buy our children. </span>

Online advertisers use algorithmic networks to create a sense of community, engagement, fun and friendship related to junk food advertising. Then they add scarcity marketing, which generates a fear of missing out.</span>

As the member for Mackellar has already noted—and as a member of the Standing Committee on Health, Aged Care and Sport, which has recently called on the government to outlaw food advertising—we have to act to protect our children. They are our most precious natural resource. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no higher priority for the Albanese Labor government than health, by strengthening Medicare and rebuilding general practice. Our government's 2024-25 budget provides $2.8 billion to continue to strengthen Medicare. This is in addition to the historic $6.1 billion investment in Medicare in the 2023-24 budget. We are taking the key steps needed to address the pressing challenges in our healthcare system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government has delivered more than double the amount of indexation to Medicare than those opposite did in almost a decade. In 2023 we delivered the biggest indexation boost for Medicare in 30 years, and this year we have delivered the second-largest increase, with almost $900 million in additional funding for Medicare. We are delivering for Australians and we are delivering for my electorate of Solomon—for Darwin and Palmerston. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It doesn't stop there. Bulk-billing was falling off a cliff because of the six-year freeze on Medicare rebates by those opposite, which is why we tripled—that's three times—the bulk-billing incentive from 1 November last year, in the largest investment in bulk-billing in history. Since we tripled the investment, we've seen a turnaround in bulk-billing, with a national increase of 1.7 percentage points in the first year, and 5.4 million additional estimated visits. My electorate saw an increase of 6.1 per cent in the bulk-billing rate. Obviously, this is incredibly helpful for families. We saw 61,000 additional estimated visits to health professionals in the Northern Territory. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cheaper medicines is another area. Our government went to the election promising Australians that we would make medicines cheaper, and we are delivering on that promise. We have delivered the largest price reduction in the 75-year history of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. People now pay no more than $31.60 for medicines on the PBS. We've introduced 60-day prescriptions for around 300 common medicines, meaning that millions of Australians are not only saving time but saving significant amounts of money as well. Australians have saved $1 billion on cheaper prescriptions so far. That is real cost-of-living help.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Urgent care clinics are making a real difference for patients and for busy hospital emergency departments. We have opened 77 urgent care clinics across Australia, including one in my electorate in Palmerston. There have been almost 860,000 visits to Medicare urgent care clinics across Australia, and all of those visits have been completely bulk-billed, which helps with the cost of living, of course, and making sure Territorians and all Australians get the care that they need. We know that the opposition have never supported Medicare urgent care clinics, because they have never supported Medicare. The shadow Treasurer has made it clear that our additional investments in Medicare urgent care clinics are on the chopping block, and that is a choice that Australians will have next year. These urgent care clinics are benefiting our community, but, if those opposite were to be on this side of the parliament, that would all be in jeopardy, as they would close. I know this would be of a great detriment to our community in Darwin and Palmerston and across the country.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, but most importantly, the workforce who run our system—like you, Deputy Speaker Freelander—are the backbone of our system, and I was delighted to see the Territory's midwifery group practice be recognised as Medicare Champions in the recent Stronger Medicare Awards, recognising them as outstanding health professionals. Since the Albanese Labor government's record investment in Medicare, our general practitioner workforce is growing. The health system added one new doctor every hour on average last year, with more doctors joining in the last two years than at any time in the past decade, and I'm really proud that, next year, Charles Darwin University will start having its own medical program. In the last two financial years, an additional 17,846 new medical practitioners have been registered to practice, which is really significant.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:17</span>):  As a child of the seventies, I have no recollection of a time before Medicare, yet, as the member for Solomon's motion notes, today, that time actually did exist just as little as 40 years ago. Today, our public health system is the envy of the world and stands in stark contrast to the toxic, discriminatory and inefficient systems that dominate some other Western economies, including the United States of America. But, as the House notes the 40th anniversary of the introduction of Medicare, I would argue that, rather than simply applauding the government for the work it's done in this 47th parliament, it's important we all reflect on the environment within which Medicare was originally created, as opposed to our current circumstance, and ask ourselves whether Medicare is still fit for purpose in 2024.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At its establishment, Medicare promised universal access to health care, based on the premise that all Australians should be able to see a doctor regardless of their socioeconomic status. It was believed this would lead to better health outcomes and relieve pressure on public hospitals. From the outset, general practitioners have played a pivotal role in stewardship of not only the Medicare system but patients more broadly, and, for many years, they have done an excellent job. Yet, today, many would argue the system no longer provides enough support for general practitioners, and, as a result, it is unravelling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As health appointments have become increasingly complicated and supportive health services like counselling, diagnostic testing, health screening and specialist referrals have become more demanding, GPs have found themselves being called on to bridge increasingly large gaps with minimal additional compensation. As a result, access to affordable primary care has been diminishing at an alarming rate. From 2013 to 2022, the former government froze Medicare rebates, leading to dramatic increases in out-of-pocket payments for patients and reduced bulk-billing by medical practitioners. As a result, today, about 1.2 million Australians annually defer or miss out on seeing a GP due to cost. This government then claims its recent investment in Medicare urgent care clinics, along with targeted bulk-billing incentives and the promised reintroduction of bulk-billing indexation for selected pathology services, have stemmed that tide. But this is not the experience of my community in North Sydney, where bulk-billing rates have fallen to a record low of nearly 15 per cent this past year. Of 54 primary care clinics in North Sydney, just under 15 per cent offer bulk-billing, and, while many Labor held seats have an urgent care clinic, as we've just heard, that is not the case in North Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, the conversations I have with people in my community suggest there are real problems that need fixing for Australians to continue to have access to the health care we expect. The sorts of issues people have raised with me vary, from frustrations at the difficulty in finding a bulk-billing clinic through to the impact of managing increasing out-of-pocket expenses for patients. At the same time, people routinely urge me to advocate for vital pathology and essential preventative health measures, like basic dentistry, to also be funded under Medicare. While all these issues are valid, the truth is GPs simply can't afford to bulk-bill, because the rebate has not kept pace with business costs, like rent. The out-of-pocket costs for a standard GP consultation in North Sydney are now around $48, yet GPs, as both small-business owners and individuals, continue to struggle. In fact, analysis by the Australian Medical Association in 2022 showed that Medicare has generally failed to keep up with the real-life costs of operating a medical practice. Ultimately, despite what the government may like to say, the system is breaking and, if we are committed to ensuring it continues to meet our contemporary healthcare needs, our government must do more than just applaud itself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the motion moved by the member for Solomon expresses gratitude to allied health professionals, and this is a truly thoughtful gesture, except I would offer the fact that many allied health professionals that I speak to would rather have that gratitude shown by having their services listed on the Medicare benefits scheme. At the end of the day, health care is consistently one of the top issues for Australians, and Medicare was a transformative piece of policy when it was first introduced. But, as the Strengthening Medicare Taskforce noted, reform is needed to ensure all Australians continue to enjoy access to world-class primary health care regardless of the politics of the electorate that they live in or their socioeconomic status.</span>

While he takes care of up north, I've got the beautiful New South Wales area of the Hunter and the seat of Paterson. I couldn't be prouder to call Paterson my home and know that, under our government, we are working to protect this incredible institution that is called Medicare. We've got a long history of protecting Medicare because it was our idea in the first place. Like a lot of good ideas, they do need to be nurtured and cared for, and that's what this Albanese government is doing. This year, in 2024, Medicare celebrates 40 years. That's 40 years of a universal healthcare system, where it doesn't matter how much you earn or where you live; primary health care is yours, and that's such an important and fundamental principle. We know that it can be transformative in people's lives. But we also know that in 2024 it can be difficult to get in to see your doctor. I know in my seat it can take up to three weeks. That's why we're working on encouraging more people to become general practitioners. We are working with amazing institutions, like the University of Newcastle, to encourage more people to become general practitioners.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This month, I had the pleasure of attending the Stronger Medicare Awards here in Canberra, where we acknowledged and honoured our Medicare Champions—those medical practitioners who work incredibly hard to provide accessible, high-quality and innovative health care to people, to their patients. I want to congratulate Dr Chris Boyle from Raymond Terrace Family Practice. Dr Chris Boyle is a Medicare Champion, and he was one of the eight finalists to be acknowledged by those awards. Dr Boyle has become a vital member of our community, but it hasn't happened overnight; it has taken him 40 years to do that, and he has been doing it for about the same time as Medicare has been around. After those 40 years, he talks to me about the fact that now about 10 per cent of graduating students go into general practice. When he graduated in the early seventies it was 50 per cent—so we have seen a decline. We know we need to turn that around. We have said it is a priority for a Labor government to do that. We want to continue to build and rebuild general practice services in all our communities.</span>

This year we delivered the second-largest increase, with almost $900 million in additional funding for Medicare. This government is delivering. We have delivered more than double the amount of indexation to Medicare than the previous government did in almost a decade. I repeat that: under our government, in just under three years, we've doubled the indexation. The previous government froze it—and hear me when I say they may freeze it again; it is a real worry. They don't love Medicare like we do, and they spend their time trying to condense it, cut it and generally wind it back—and that's not good enough.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that we have to take a serious position and action on delivering bulk-billing as well, and that's why we tripled the incentive for bulk-billing. Since November 2023 we've seen the largest investment in bulk-billing. In my electorate of Paterson, that's a 3.1 per cent increase—so since November last year there's been a 3.1 per cent increase in bulk-billing. That equals 75,737 visits that have been bulk-billed in my electorate alone. That's important. Labor cares about Medicare and will continue to.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WARE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:27</span>):  I rise to speak on this motion in relation to Medicare. I thank the member for Solomon for giving me the opportunity to speak on this very important motion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As 2024 marks 40 years since the introduction of Medicare, this is an appropriate time for us as Australians to acknowledge that Medicare has been transformative in the area of public health. But it is also an opportunity for us to look at how much better we can do in this space. I particularly want to talk about my electorate of Hughes, which is down in the Sutherland shire in southern Sydney and also now into south-west Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have sat here for 2½ years now and heard this government talk about the fact that they now have more GPs. I heard the member for Paterson mention that as well. That may be the experience in her electorate but it is certainly not the experience in my electorate, and it is certainly not the experience in my electorate that there is more bulk-billing occurring. There has been a 20 to 30 per cent drop in bulk-billing in 2½ years in the Sutherland shire and in south-west Sydney under this Labor government, under Minister Butler. I've done the research on this, and I'd be very happy to again send Minister Butler the names of every single GP practice within my electorate that no longer bulk-bills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We return to the motion and also to the position of those in government that say they have increased the number of GPs. Wattle Grove Family Medical Practice, which is in my electorate and serves the local area, has over 3,000 patients on its books, and Dr John Stanford and I have been advocating to the health minister on this issue to no avail. He refuses to meet with me on this and refuses to assist my patients and my electorate. Many of those patients are veterans' families because the medical centre is located in Holsworthy. It simply requires a change of designation from inner metropolitan to outer metropolitan; that would be enough to restore a GP, a registrar, to that practice. While I have all the respect in the world for the honourable member for Solomon, it would be helpful perhaps if he could have a talk to the Minister for Health and Aged Care to find out why it is that the health minister does not care about my electorate there, around Holsworthy and Wattle Grove. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we are talking about this government not caring, I want to talk about vision health in south-west Sydney, particularly in and around Campbelltown Hospital. I have written similarly to the state health minister and the federal health minister on this. Formerly optometrists in south-west Sydney could refer patients with glaucoma and cataracts for surgery at the Sydney and Sydney Eye Hospital. That option has been cut under this government. Further, this government has said that not only can optometrists not refer patients to the Sydney and Sydney Eye Hospital but patients have to go to Liverpool Hospital and the referral can only be through a GP or an ophthalmologist. There are people in my electorate around south-western Sydney who cannot afford to go and see an ophthalmologist or have to wait months and months, sometimes years, to see one. People in my electorate are losing their vision because this government has changed its position on vision health in south-western Sydney. I particularly want to thank Clinton Maynard on 2GB. I was speaking to him the other morning at about 4.30. He's an insomniac, similarly to me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, I want to talk about pelvic pain clinics. I acknowledge that this government has established some pelvic pain clinics for women. I've been advocating for a pain clinic for women where endometriosis, menstrual pain, menopause, PCOS and all of the many other issues that are unique to women could be dealt with in the one place. I have been told that women in my electorate can go to Mittagong—Mittagong is 90 kilometres from the centre of my electorate—or they can go to Leichhardt. It's more than 40 kilometres from Macquarie Fields to Leichhardt. This government must do better on Medicare. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Reserve Bank has made it clear that interest rates are staying higher for longer due to Labor's reckless spending. We have seen, under this Labor government, interest rates go from 0.35 per cent to now 4.35 per cent, with the Reserve Bank refusing to rule out further increases. This means that, every month, mortgage holders and renters are worried about increasing rates and how they can afford to cover their repayments or their rent. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this government we've seen some 12 interest rate rises, with the average mortgageholder now $35,000 a year worse off through increased mortgage repayments—and that's before we get to the small to medium sized business sector. I'm speaking to plenty of businesses who are struggling with increasing repayments or increasing interest costs on their overdrafts or their loans, and that is starting to impact on their ability to continue to do business. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst Australians have been watching as interest rates go down in other countries across the world, including in the United States, Canada, the UK, South Korea and New Zealand, we are yet to see a rate cut here in Australia. This is despite the Reserve Bank's position being clear that underlying inflation remains too high and despite the Prime Minister declaring that the fight against inflation is done. It's a long way from the case. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Reserve Bank forecast showed that the core inflation target of 2.5 per cent will not be reached until somewhere around December 2026. That's still two years away—two years more pain for hardworking Australian families. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at some of the prices that have gone up over the past several years. Since the election the price of everything has gone up by nearly 10 per cent—or more, in many cases—including: health costs, up by some 10½ per cent; education costs, up by 11.2 per cent; food prices, up by 12.3 per cent; housing costs, up by 13.1 per cent; rents, up by 16.3 per cent; financial and insurance costs, up by 17.3 per cent; and gas prices, up by nearly 34 per cent. It's that last one that I'd like to touch on. For one of my local businesses that uses a lot of gas to produce their fabric products, their gas bill has gone up from $125,000 a year to now $350,000 a year. They are talking about closing their doors, because they're saying now it is too hard to continue to do business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All this is in the context of the Prime Minister saying during the last election campaign that things would be cheaper under a Labor government. Well, as I frequently say to people back in my electorate, don't listen to what this government says; look at what they do, because nine times out of 10 these are two completely and utterly different things. That is exactly what we've seen with the government's promises and the promises by the Prime Minister in the lead-up to the election. They all sounded great and sounded very nice, but at the end of the day the government have failed to deliver, whether it's on electricity, cheaper mortgages or just things being cheaper more generally. This government hasn't delivered for the Australian people; they've actually made things worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is only a coalition government that will get things back on track so the Australian people can enjoy an improved standard of living. And we need to see this government continue to work, to fight, to tackle the scourge of inflation. Yet they're not doing that. They're continuing their reckless spending and the ideological pursuits right across the policy suite. We saw again on the weekend the true cost of their energy plan come to fruition, which is only going to further increase inflation. Only a coalition government will work towards bringing costs down for everyday hardworking Australians.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hawke</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:37</span>):  Australians are doing it tough. Families have been grappling with rising costs, whether at the grocery checkout, at the petrol station or in their mortgage repayments. For many, these pressures have made it harder than ever to stretch their budgets and make ends meet. We understand this, which is why tackling the cost of living has been and remains the top priority for the Albanese Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make two points right upfront here. Firstly, Australians are not going to cop the arrogant hypocrisy of the Liberal Party coming to this place, crying crocodile tears and pretending to care about working people. Secondly, the Liberal Party, in their last term of government—nearly a decade—did immense damage to our economy, and it will take significant time to turn that damage around and set our economy straight. But we are putting in place the critical components to ensure that we have a strong, resilient, sustainable economy that serves working people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Labor came to office we inherited an economy that was burdened by a trillion dollars of Liberal debt. And it wasn't just the size of the debt that was concerning; it was the legacy of poor decision-making behind it. Over their decade in power, we saw the worst productivity growth in more than 50 years. We saw deliberate wage suppression that kept Australians' pay stagnant. And we saw reckless spending, including billions in handouts, to corporations making record profits. This was an approach that left Australian families worse off and our economy weaker overall. Inflation had soared under the Liberal Party to 6.1 per cent, and real wages were falling, leaving households under immense pressure. That's why the Albanese Labor government took strong and decisive action to stabilise the economy, address inflation and ease the strain where possible on families and households.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today headline inflation has dropped to 2.8 per cent—its lowest level in nearly four years. This progress didn't happen by accident. It was the result of tough decisions to repair the budget, improve fiscal discipline and deliver targeted relief to those in our community who need it most. Our energy rebates, childcare reforms and cheaper medicines have all made a difference, but we know that there's more to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Falling inflation doesn't yet mean lower prices for families. For many the pressure on their budgets remains severe, and we are under no illusion that our work is already done. To truly ease the burden on Australian families, it is essential that workers see real wage growth. For too long wages stagnated while prices soared. Australian workers were falling behind, working harder but able to buy less. This was the reality under the previous Liberal government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under our Labor government that trend has reversed. Real wages have now grown for four consecutive quarters. The latest ABS data shows the wage price index grew by 0.8 per cent in the last quarter, bringing annual growth to 3.5 per cent. Crucially real wages adjusted for inflation rose by 0.7 per cent in the year to September 2024. This is the strongest real wage growth in four years. Compare this to the five quarters leading up to the last election, when real wages fell by 3.4 per cent under the coalition—that's five consecutive quarters where workers were going backwards, with rising costs eroding their take-home pay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since we came to office nominal wages have grown at an annualised rate of 3.8 per cent, nearly double—double!—the 2.2 per cent recorded under our Liberal predecessors. While wage growth has moderated slightly, it remains stronger than at any time during the coalition years. For the first time in years Australian workers are seeing their pay outpace inflation. It's not just a statistic. People can feel it at home in their household budgets and when they go to the supermarkets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem is not solved—no-one is suggesting that it is—but it is a meaningful shift that is finally helping families to manage higher costs and to improve their quality of life. There's not an Australian worker in this country—no matter who they vote for, no matter what their politics are—who believes that the Liberal Party will do a better job of helping Australians in realising real wage growth, realising a regular pay rise and keeping their household costs down.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="201906" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr YOUNG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:42</span>):  I rise today to speak in support of the motion moved by the member for Forde. Many of the people in the electorate of Longman, which I proudly serve, are doing it tough. The question is: why? Of course there are factors that contribute to why we have seen, since Labor came into government, a real decline on Australians' standard of living. But these factors are not unique to this government. The specifics, or factors, that contribute to why interest rates rise, why household expenses rise and why inflation grows at a faster rate than real wages grow vary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whether it be a conflict at home or abroad, unforeseen blips in the stock markets around the globe, a GFC or a once-in-a-hundred-year pandemic, every government has faced unforeseen challenges that affect our Australian economy and our way of life. But the test for any government is how these issues are dealt with to minimise, or even to remove entirely, the impacts on the Australian people. This, after all, is one of the key responsibilities of any government, regardless of which party is the incumbent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Forget the spin, the headlines, the talk, the political war of words and the name-calling. The real litmus tests on the success or failure of any government on how they have performed in neutralising the impacts on the people we were elected to serve—the Australian public—are simply measuring the data and comparing that data to previous governments and long-term averages, and, most of all, the actual real-life experiences of people. When we do this measurement and comparison at this time, the results are not good, to say the least.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can see that interest rates have risen 12 times since this government came to power, meaning that people paying off their family homes are now paying on average an extra $2,916 per month on their mortgage, while the average household income has only risen by $616 per month in the same period. Electricity has risen by an average of 30 per household, or $420, since the last election. Rents have risen $520 per month on average in the city of Moreton Bay as investors with mortgages are paying much higher repayments with the 12 interest rate rises, which in most cases they simply cannot absorb and have to pass on either in full or in part to tenants already enduring this homegrown cost-of-living crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why has this homegrown cost-of-living crisis happened on this Labor government's watch? Would the results have been different under a coalition government? History demonstrates that, yes, Australians have always fared better under a coalition government. Historically, real wages have been higher and interest rates and inflation have been lower under a coalition government. However, there is an underlying issue people rarely speak of: business confidence. I can testify that, in my own small-business experience, quite simply, whenever the coalition has been in government, my businesses have experienced double-digit growth, including during the pandemic. In contrast, when Labor have been in government, the businesses I was involved in had either single-digit growth or, worse, no growth. From speaking to other small-business owners, the experience in the main is much the same.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What does this mean practically? It means that, when business confidence is down when we have a Labor government, small and medium businesses stop spending and investing in their businesses. Just the bare necessities are purchased. New staff are not employed and in some cases staff must be laid off to the lack of growth. This all contributes to a slowing economy. When the coalition is in government, business confidence is high and, as a result, small and medium businesses invest in new equipment and hire extra staff in anticipation of growth in their businesses. This of course leads to cash being fed into the economy through higher tax receipts as businesses become more profitable, which slows inflation. Unfortunately, with the fall in business confidence and the following tightening of their purse strings, the Labor governments begin to spend taxpayers' money on splashing tax to help alleviate the inevitable hard times the Australian people begin to suffer, which is a short-term fix that just increases debt and inflation, only compounding the problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To exacerbate the problem even further, as the unemployment rate rises, Labor governments are forced to employ more public servants to keep the unemployment rate down, as evidenced in this term, for which the data from the ABS shows that around 90 per cent of new jobs in 2024 were in the public sector or industries like aged care or the NDIS, which are funded by the federal government, compared with more than 50 per cent of new jobs created in the private sector under the previous coalition government. Of course, we need a healthy Public Service, but private sector jobs create revenue for government through taxes paid, whereas Public Service jobs are just straight out costs to government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians aren't stupid. They will see through the spin, the headlines and the personal attacks, and the question they will ask themselves before they vote at the next election is: am I better off than I was three years ago? The answer in nearly every case will be a resounding 'no'.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr CHARLTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:47</span>):  I thank the mover of this motion because many Australians are struggling with cost-of-living pressures and feeling the effects of inflation. Inflation takes the most from those who have the least to give. It hurts people who can't make their budget stretch any further. It hurts first home buyers who can't pay high interest rates or who are struggling with rent. It hurts people already experiencing low wages growth over the last 10 years. Nowhere is this more obvious than in my electorate, where financial pressures are palpable. Parramatta Mission's daily meals program saw an increased uptake of more than 100 per cent over the past year. Food parcel uptake was up nearly 200 per cent in that same period, and Centrelink referrals have more than tripled.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the front line of the inflation challenge in Australia. The problem is serious, but, unfortunately, the motion put by those opposite is not serious. They don't seek to grapple with the causes of inflation and they don't seek to provide any sensible alternatives on how to deal with it. The first part of this motion notes 'that the government has failed to tame inflation'. Saying that the government has failed to tame inflation is a bit like the arsonist asking the fire brigade why it took them so long to put the fire out, because inflation was caused by the Liberals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Inflation increased in the last two years of the Liberal term. It was running at 3½ per cent in the fourth quarter of 2021 and, by the time they left office, it had risen each quarter: from 3.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent to 6.1 per cent to 7.3 per cent and finally to 7.8 per cent. In the last year of the Liberal government, inflation was on the escalator going up quarter after quarter, getting worse and worse. They left the inflation problem that this government has had to deal with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why did it go up so much? Why did the Liberals increase inflation so much as to leave it at the highest rate that it had been in Australia in decades? The answer is that they had the most expansionary budgets in Australia's peacetime history. They wasted billions of dollars on JobKeeper, the worst targeted program in Australia's economic history, subsidising businesses that were fine, subsidising businesses that had profits going up and subsidising businesses that were employing more people and posting record returns. Treasury analysis shows that JobKeeper wasted $50 billion. It was paid to Harvey Norman, private schools, Qantas and hundreds of companies that did not need it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They put an enormous amount of money into the Australian economy that stoked the inflation fire. As I said, it increased it from 3.5 per cent to 7.8 per cent. The reason inflation is high in Australia is the fiscal profligacy of those opposite. Not only did they not deliver a budget surplus but they did not get within a bull's roar of a budget surplus. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second part of this motion talks about interest rates. It says that interest rates have already gone down in the United States and the United Kingdom. I have a couple of things on this. Firstly, interest rates in the United Kingdom and the United States are higher than they are in Australia. Interest rates in both the UK and the US are 4.75 per cent—higher than rates in Australia. Secondly, when we look at the record, Australia has actually had a smaller increase in inflation overall than in all of those other countries. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition are continually saying that inflation is coming down in these other countries. They had cumulatively more inflation than Australia has experienced. The UK, from the latest figures back to 2020, had 25 points of increased inflation, the USA had 24 points and New Zealand had 23 points. By contrast, Australia, over that same period, had just 20 points increase. We had a lower increase in overall price level than all of the three countries mentioned in this motion. And the reason we had a smaller increase in the price level than all of the countries that the opposition mentions in this motion is that we have delivered the fiscal discipline in order to bring inflation back down. In fact, we've more than halved the inflation that they left us with. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:53</span>):  I would like to start by thanking the member for Forde for bringing this very important debate into this chamber, the people's house. Any local member that's out in their community, talking to and listening to their constituents, will know just how tough people are doing it right now across this country. I know how tough they're doing it in my seat of Sturt and I'm sure that's no different to any other electorate across the country right now.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">After 2½ years of this government, unfortunately, things are tougher than ever and families are making very difficult decisions around the kitchen table about the household budget because costs are ever increasing and they are finding it more and more difficult to make ends meet. Coming into the Christmas season, it's a particularly tough time for some families that have to make sacrifices they haven't had to make before in the period leading into Christmas. There's just not enough discretionary spending left in the household budget because the cost of things that you can't avoid are so very high under this Labor government. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whether you've got a mortgage or you rent, whether you're going to the supermarket, buying your groceries or whether it's been the dramatic increase in energy prices—your electricity and gas bills—those costs have dramatically increased 2½ years into this Albanese government. Of course, we'll never forget that Labor said that, by voting for them, bills would go down by $275 a year. Well, I've never had anyone come into my office since Labor came to power and say that anything like that has occurred to their household electricity bills. They're all going up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous speaker interestingly just gave us a lecture on fiscal discipline and responsibility, and I suppose maybe he is or isn't on the inside with how this government is going to pursue their own fiscal decisions in the lead-up to the next election. What we've heard so far—what we've seen so far—is that this government seems to be interested in spending a lot of money going into the next election. We've seen the beginnings of some massive multibillion dollar commitments, but we hear rumours of many more to come. We hear that the federal Labor government want to follow the strategy of the Queensland state Labor government, which is interesting given the result of that election just recently. We hear of massive amounts of expenditure. They are trying to throw money around and buy the votes of the Australian people in the lead-up to the election to try and make it look like they have a plan to deal with this cost-of-living crisis that we're in. What that'll mean is a lot more—dramatically more—spending from this government. The last thing that we need right now is a huge amount of government spending when interest rates are high and when inflation has been running hot. The worst thing for our economy that we could see happen right now is an enormous amount of government spending. You don't have to take my word for that, because we know that the Reserve Bank governor herself has made it very clear that big spending government programs will increase inflation and will of course impact on the decision-making processes that the Reserve Bank go through in the months ahead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone, hopefully, wants to see interest rates coming down, and everyone wants to see the Reserve Bank be in a position where the data supports them reducing the cash rate. I want that for my constituents. I'm sure everyone wants to see that happen. So, if the Reserve Bank governor is making comments and giving warnings about massive increases in government spending, meaning that they will be in a position where they can't reduce interest rates—in fact, they might have to go up again, depending on just how significant this Labor spendathon that we anticipate happening in the months ahead is—then that is a frightening prospect for the average Australian family. Going into this election campaign, if Labor are announcing multiple billion-dollar cash giveaways to try and buy votes from people, I know that the average Australian will know what that means: that higher government spending is inflationary. It means your mortgage is higher, it means your rents are higher, it means all the costs in our economy will be going up, and, at the same time, we might have to see taxes go up as well for this government to meet some of those costs. We don't know whether they'll hand down a budget. It doesn't feel like they will. I wouldn't want to if I were them, given what they've got planned in store. But it is a frightening prospect for the people of this country that Labor are going to spend, spend, spend and increase interest rates in the process.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has said it has consulted thoroughly, but this is not the case. The remit for the JSCEM—Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters—inquiry was much broader, and the conclusions were very high level. The government said it has consulted, but we did not see any legislation until a few days ago. With such a fundamental change, we need to consider all the consequences, intended and unintended, and this has not been done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The assistant minister spoke about trust and wanting to build trust, but the process here does anything but build trust in our parliamentary processes and the way laws are passed. There is a need for reform. We desperately need transparency, and I think there's a good case for donation caps at some level. But this bill goes so much further, with a massive increase in public funding and spending caps that tip the balance in favour of parties and incumbents. We really need to have serious public scrutiny before this is passed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll give a bit of history and context on why this needs serious scrutiny now. There has been a consistent decline in support for the major parties over the last 40 years. At the last election we saw the lowest primary vote for majors, with one in three voters voting for a minor or an Independent with their primary vote. The will of the people is changing, and this is a threat to the major parties. Parties are now machines that are designed to win not lead, but like any institution the parties have a strong immune system and are fighting to retain power. This bill is a desperate attempt to arrest that trend. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters did an inquiry into the 2022 election, and I sat on that inquiry on that committee. Evidence was heard. A report was put forward. I put in my additional comments on the parts of the evidence that the major parties ignored. They were positions put forward by experts, academics, democracy think tanks—people with an interest in the health of our system rather than in preserving the existing power structures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I provided a path that the government could have taken that showed that it was respecting the will of the people and the integrity of our political system through the restoring trust bill last August and through the fair and transparent elections bill that was introduced in both houses in February. The government could have worked with the crossbench to pass legislation, with appropriate review and inquiries. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government stated that its policy was real-time disclosure above $1,000, and there have been many private members' bills that have been put forward about improving transparency like this. But the government said it couldn't do this transparency change without addressing other issues such as banning lies and political donations, which are now in a separate bill anyway. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I and other crossbenchers have engaged in good faith with the minister and provided a pathway to good reform without it being a major party stitch-up. The government kept saying that it was working on a bill dealing with all parts of electoral reform together. We now have two separate bills, one massively increasing public funding and imposing caps that will lock out competitors and one dealing with banning lies, which is probably destined to go nowhere in this parliament. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been so many delays and radio silence on the basis that this is very complicated and that the drafting was very difficult. We suspected that we might see a last-minute stitch-up by the major parties, presented now at the end of the term, to lock in party advantage while it's still possible. That's exactly what we've got. If the major parties want to rebuild trust and regain their vote share, this is not the way to do it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this bill is so complicated that it has taken an entire term of parliament to draft, surely it needs to be considered by a committee and the public needs to be given an opportunity to comment. The experts, the people who don't have a vested interest and are interested in protecting political competition and allowing our democracy to keep evolving, need to be able to look at this in detail before it gets passed as law. Voters can see through this cynical approach and this cynical attempt to lock in the declining support for the majors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last time electoral reform was attempted there was public outcry about the increased public funding, and it was dropped. Why would it be any different now? It's very hard to see that this is anything other than an attempt to push it through without appropriate review. It needs two types of scrutiny. Firstly, we need scrutiny on the intended outcome of the bill. We don't let Coles and Woolies make the laws about supermarket competition, but here we've got the two major parties banding together to make the laws about who can compete with them. It also needs scrutiny to look at the unintended consequences of the way it's been drafted. This is 224 pages long. We've had a few days to look at it. No-one outside a few crossbenchers and a few people have been given access to it. It needs external review so that the experts can really look at this, and, if it's such complicated drafting, let's make sure we know what it's actually going to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of issues within the bill that mean it should urgently move to a committee rather than be pushed through. On the public funding, this bill asks taxpayers to pay more to have less choice. There's a huge increase in funding here. Estimates seem to say that it would have been about $70 million more in taxpayers' funding if it had been applied in 2022. Those numbers may not be exactly right, and all those numbers are based on what we suspect at this point, so we need to understand that more deeply. We haven't had enough time to go through it in detail. But this is a massive slap in the face to Australians during a cost-of-living crisis, and it has the effect of locking in the major parties and the incumbents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The funding is done based on the last election, so, if you didn't run in the last election, you don't have access to any funding. To add insult to injury, the major parties can tap into this funding in advance of an election, based on what they expect to win. The fact that this is possible shows that this a reliable revenue stream for the status quo and creates another hurdle for challengers. It also includes a huge increase in administrative funding, which, in my mind, is a ridiculous bribe. There is no relationship between the additional $30,000 per year per MP and the actual increase in administrative costs. This is clearly aimed at getting broad support from both the major parties. It translates to about $17 million in extra taxpayer funding every year—three-quarters of which goes to major parties. There is not a linear relationship between the number of MPs and the administrative task, and no boardroom in the country would accept that the administrative costs were going to increase with the number of people involved. There are economies of scale. We know the ALP currently has four people to meet the administrative needs of 104 parliamentarians. This would massively increase that, and there needs to be some evidence that it will actually cause an increase in workload that's commensurate with the increase in funding, but there is absolutely no clear argument being put forward for why that number was chosen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Spending caps sound great. No-one likes to see too much money in politics, but, effectively, they lock in the status quo and create a non-level playing field. In drafting my legislation, I tried to find a model that worked on spending caps, but it is almost impossible. But, if your address transparency and donation caps, the spending caps become obsolete. If 5,000 people donate $200 each to a candidate, why shouldn't they be allowed to spend that on a campaign? The spending caps model locks in the incumbents in two ways. Firstly, it doesn't account for incumbent advantages. As a sitting MP, I have these advantages. I have an office. I have a car. I have a team. I have a budget for communications in the hundreds of thousands. None of these count towards my $800,000 cap, but a new challenger would have to fund all of these things. That is not a level playing field. Secondly, it doesn't account for party advantage. There's an outrageous exemption to the divisional cap for party advertising. As long as they stay within their $90 million cap, a party can advertise as much as it likes against a challenger, saying, 'Vote for the Liberal Party,' or 'Vote for the Labor Party,' and that doesn't count towards the $800,000 cap. That is not a level playing field. The government will say that they're caught by the $90 million cap. Sure, if a party intended to run a hard campaign in every seat in the country, then they would have to spend less than $800,000 in each seat because of this cap, but we all know how this actually works. If, for example, a party ran a full $800,000 personalised campaign in 100 seats, they then would have a $10 million spare party funding budget which they could use to target 12 contested seats to double the spending of their challengers. They could double that, and that's not even counting their incumbency benefits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We desperately need transparency. People should know who's funding their candidates before they vote. But this could have been done on any day of this parliament with the support of both houses. This does not need to be bundled up with this package of reforms that locks in the status quo. The problem with it now is they've left it so late that it won't start in time for the next election. At the next election, you will have no idea how much the parties are spending in each electorate. Passing this bill now will not solve that problem. If this is not going to work in time for the next election, we might as well slow it down and actually look at the legislation and see if this is what the Australian public actually want, as now one in three are now casting their primary vote for someone other than the major parties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even within the transparency legislation that's being put forward there are so many exemptions to the definition of 'gift'. We need to go through those with a fine-tooth comb. The definition of 'gift' has been expanded in some small ways, but there is a three-page list of exemptions to what is a gift. This includes: subscriptions, memberships, related party payments, annual levies on members' staff and employees, disposition of property between members of a party's expenditure group or branches, any equipment sharing, office accommodation, a bequest, a loan, a gift to an MP for their personal use and a gift not paid into a federal account. Some of these might be very valid, but these need to be looked at if we're going to make this change. The public deserves better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, this bill is a travesty. It dresses up a cynical, anticompetitive oligopoly play as reform which is being fed to an unsuspecting public, with the major parties pretending that it will actually make our system better. There are huge problems with the process it's gone through. There are problems with the massive increase to public funding which locks in the status quo. There are problems with limiting spending in a way that creates an uneven playing field for new challenges. The transparency reform is too little, too late. And it's a huge disappointment and insult to the electorate, who demanded better. The major parties are relying on the increasing disengagement of the public, the complexity of this bill, the crowded media space and rushing it through to get away with the only path they've got left to arrest the trend of declining support for the sclerotic leadership the two parties offer to the public.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My community sent a message to the major parties at the last election that they will not be taken for granted, they will not be taken for fools and they expect something better than what the major parties are offering. If this goes through the parliament with no inquiry and no public scrutiny, the only choice the public will have is to speak to the major parties in the only currency they understand: votes. I urge the government to act in the public interest, not in its own interest, and refer this to a committee hearing so that the unintended and intended consequences can be fully understood and the experts and the public can have an opportunity to comment and decide whether this is the direction we want to take our democracy.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STEGGALL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:28</span>):  I second the member for Curtin's motion and strongly agree with the call that these two bills must go to inquiry and be properly examined. The hubris and hypocrisy from the government today in justifying their actions to bring forward this legislation are breathtaking. I call on every member of the government side and the opposition to think carefully about what you are doing if you put your name to this legislation. At a time of cost-of-living pressures, these two major parties have cooked up a new deal on new political donation laws designed to keep them in power, and they want the public to pay for it. The hubris is staggering. We need to reform our broken system of political donations; no-one disagrees with that. It is wrong that a billionaire can spend $132 million on trying to get his candidate selected, that there are no limits on corporate donations, especially when companies actually have government contracts, and that it takes months for donations to political parties to be disclosed. And, when they are, they're not broken down in a seat-by-seat way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what we do want to see is scrutiny on this major piece of reform. This piece of legislation is substantial. It has taken a huge amount of time to bring it here, and the government is proposing to table it today, force a debate this week and then have us vote on it by the end of the week. That is just the height of insult to the Australian people; that is the best way we can put it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No-one wants Australia to drift towards a US system where political campaigns have become multibillion dollar exercises, forcing candidates into an unholy dance with big donors to raise the cash they need. We also don't want to end up like the US with a malaise of only two choices—and two poor choices at that—that don't end up delivering good policies for the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill introduced today—and I've got to say that the member for Perth was really given the dud job of the government to have to table this bill and put your name to it—is said to have the coalition's support, so it will be interesting to see every coalition member maybe exercise their free vote and think carefully of their integrity if they are genuinely going to support this bill. It is highly beneficial to major parties and it smacks of a dirty deal designed to cement their duopoly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Independents and minor party representatives now make up 12 per cent of the House and 27 per cent of the Senate, yet we have not been consulted on this legislation for months. I first saw a copy of this and was briefed at 12.30 yesterday, less than 24 hours ago. This bill will have such a long consequence to Australian democracy, and yet there is no scrutiny being allowed on this bill. We're being presented with this 215-page bill making significant reform to our electoral process with less than 24 hours and now a proposal that Labor and the coalition intend to rush it through the House this week without proper inquiry, despite the fact it's not intended to come into effect until 2028. Send it off for inquiry and get a report in the new year—unless the intention is that we're not going to come back in the new year. Maybe the government can come clean to the Australian people on that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There appears to be a flagrant double standard. I understand that, whilst the donation reform will be pushed through with no scrutiny this week, the truth-in-political-advertising bill is intended to languish. The government has no intention to push that one for debate and to a vote, because it wouldn't want to be stopped from lying when it comes to its advertising. Not only are the Australian people being asked to pay more to political parties; they're actually going to have to pay for the privilege of being lied to as well, because there's a constant delay in introducing voter protections. The last time the two major parties got together to agree on an 'integrity measure' was the National Anti-Corruption Commission. Look how well that turned out: a body that has not held a single public hearing has failed to deal with some of our biggest sector scandals, like robodebt, and has adverse findings about its handling of internal conflicts of interest. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Worse still, when it comes to donations, the government is proposing to reach into public coffers now to top up the shortfalls the major parties will experience as a result of their new fundraising constraints. At a time when cost-of-living pressures are a daily worry for households, they are proposing to give themselves an extra boost to funding. Under the government's proposal, public funding per vote will rise from $3.50 to $5 at a cost that is north of $100 million. They can't find the money to top up payments for people on JobSeeker or to deal with the rental crisis, but apparently we can afford additional largesse to the political class. The hypocrisy is staggering. Asking taxpayers to pay more to fund the major parties while making it harder for new entrants to participate has the unmistakable feel of rigging the market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill proposes restrictions on the size of donations and the total amount that can be given by individuals, but it is the proposed spending caps which, in my view, are deliberately designed to put a foot on the scales in favour of our major parties. The government has made it sound like the problem is from the billionaires that fund candidates, but the real problem comes from within the parties, with 23 per cent of the major parties' donation receipts to the Australian Electoral Commission showing a non-declared source. That accounts for around $290 million over the past five years going to the major parties' coffers with no public record of where it came from.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this proposed bill, major parties will now be able to spend up to $90 million nationally while a person that chooses to stand as an independent in a seat will be restricted to spending $800,000 in a particular seat. Sure, the major party MP or candidate will also be subject to that candidate cap in a particular seat, but, at the same time, the major party can run a parallel Senate ticket campaign and its political party advertising. It's clear that that $90 million cap will not be spent evenly across candidates by the parties and can be put disproportionately in marginal seats to fend off a challenger.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The major parties will run national television brand campaigns to reach into everyone's living rooms. They can run a centralised campaign office, databases and infrastructure. An Independent taking on a major party candidate must set that up from scratch. To add insult to injury, the proposal in this bill is that an incumbent party or MP will have access to a $30,000-a-year admin cost. It's a linear increase for the parties but a challenger has nothing. The challenger has the 'thanks for coming; you can bear the cost', but a major party MP gets the public purse to pay for it. It's such a gross imbalance and it will be such a weakening of our democracy. It is not a strengthening, because the contest to enter into parliament will be less fair.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Duopolies stifle competition, just like with Coles and Woolies. If the major parties make it too difficult for new players to enter, Australians will end up with fewer choices and poor policy outcomes. Independents bring smart solutions and positive impacts. That is the difference, and that is why the Australian public are turning away from major parties. They can see through this. Whilst the government delivered this on a Friday afternoon, like putting out the trash—no different to the Morrison government when it comes to that tactic—the Australian people will absolutely see through this. The big call in the 2025 election will be that we need to get as many Independents into this parliament as possible, because this piece of legislation is stifling competition. It is there to make sure that political parties are just here for power, not for actual smart solutions and real legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to deal with lies in political advertising. The government has put forward its misinformation and disinformation bill, and that has been contentious and has concerned many. It's a necessary guardrail, but there are concerns. It would be the height of hypocrisy if, then, the government does not proceed with pushing for the truth-in-political-advertising bill to be debated and voted on with urgency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The public can have one standard, but the political class has a different one. It is outrageous. I very strongly support the member for Curtin's motion that this bill should be sent to inquiry. Both bills should be treated equally. The Australian public deserves a robust democracy and the opportunity to participate fairly. We need a fair and equal playing field, and this bill is just trying to lock in a monopoly by the major parties.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister, Assistant Minister to the Attorney-General and Assistant Minister for the Public Service</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:37</span>):  Given some of what we've heard—and I know we'll hear from a range of members who want to make contributions on suggestions of where this bill should now go—I want to restate, while we've moved on to a different topic, some of the background as to how we've ended up at this point, all of the consultation that has occurred up until this point and also the intention of these reforms. As I said before, they are the largest reforms and improvements to Australian democracy in some 40 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This latest round goes back to 5 August 2022, when the Special Minister of State wrote to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters requesting that they initiate a review into the last election as a standard practice but with a specific focus on donation reforms, funding of elections, limits on spending, truth in advertising and how we enhance electoral participation. I commend the Special Minister of State for doing that because, rather than just providing the normal reference, he looked to what it was that we needed to preserve Australian democracy for the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw incredibly diligent work from the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, releasing an interim report on 19 June 2022 and their final report on 27 November 2023, recommending, amongst the things that we now see in front of us, lower disclosure thresholds, real-time reporting, donation caps, spending caps, the introduction of administrative funding and a number of other electoral participation reforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having gone through all that process—all of that work done by members on the crossbench, the opposition, government, the Greens party and elsewhere—you would expect that the government would then follow through on our commitment, and we did. The minister released a statement welcoming and accepting the findings of that review and committing that we would find ourselves in the place we find ourselves today: in this term looking at what we can do to further enhance our electoral system but with a specific focus on the influence of big money in politics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that is something that many in the Australian community are concerned about. They see those who have access to millions, hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars. When people have access to that amount of capital, does it mean that we have a less-than-level playing field? Indeed, I've come to the conclusion it does and that we need to do something about it. That's the conclusion the government has come to. Just to remind those following along with this debate: what is actually being proposed? These are very sensible amendments. Australia's electoral system is one of the strongest in the world. We have people time and time again look to our system for what can be learnt for other stable or emerging democracies. I think Australia proudly does that work, whether we be sending parliamentarians on parliamentary exchanges to share insight, sharing across the public service or, indeed, having the Electoral Commission itself engage with other election regulatory bodies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go through these broad policy proposals again. There would be caps on receiving donations, with a capped amount of $20,000 to a recipient for each individual donor per calendar year. That's reasonable. That's not just about making sure that we don't have big money; it's also about making sure that you don't have people who might have those $2 million campaigns disproportionately funded by one source or another. There would be an anti-avoidance measure to ensure that individual donors can donate only a capped amount per calendar year and only a capped amount to any individual state or territory per calendar year. There would be a cap on campaign spending, ensuring that entities are able to spend only a capped amount on electoral expenditure per calendar year, tied into the federal caps—again, making sure it is the quality of the ideas, not just the quality of your fundraising, that determines who ends up in parliament. This would clarify the definition of a gift so that we capture more of the funds that are coming into the federal campaign accounts. It would lower the disclosure threshold. At the moment, even with those who claim to be disclosing every donation, we see time and time again declarations of anonymous donations, going from that $16,900 index figure down to $1,000. Again, this would make sure that we have a much better idea of who is putting money where and who is funding what campaigns and make sure that Australian voters know where that money is going in real time. I just said before that under the current system voters have to wait up to 24 weeks to find out who funded a campaign. That's just not acceptable, and we should take action to change that. That's why this bill requires that entities will be required to disclose monthly in arrears during the term, weekly once the writ is issued and then daily within the seven days leading up to an election and the seven days after the election, because it's really important that we have that transparency and that people don't time or game the system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got mandated federal campaign accounts to make sure that it is possible and easy for the Australian Electoral Commission to audit donations and election funding and to make sure that electoral expenditure is paid out of it. Again, this would enhance compliance for those who are standing for election—and I note that everyone who will speak in this debate is someone who has been successful at an election. Indeed, by having the mandated federal campaign accounts, we're also making sure that those who are unsuccessful are held to a higher standard of scrutiny and accountability and also that there are sensible ways that encourage people to participate in Australia's great democracy. We should encourage people to nominate. We should encourage people to have the contest of ideas at the ballot box. This bill does that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do have increases to public funding and provisions for advances of public funding. Again, unashamedly, this is all about reducing the influence of big money on elections and recognising that we have a higher level of transparency and accountability work that needs to be done. I don't want to stand here in three years time with someone saying that, because they didn't have the resources, they couldn't comply. Every member, including Independents, will be provided with additional support to make sure that we have compliance and to make sure that the Australian people get the information they want. Also, there are sensible transitional provisions to make sure that the Australian Electoral Commission, admired around the world, can implement this in an effective way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we stand here today, we know that billionaires—people with hundreds of millions of dollars—are increasingly using their wealth to influence Australian elections. If we don't act now, our democracy is on track to become an arms race of the biggest spending, with endless fundraising and vested interests. We should act to restrict big donors and we should act to strengthen Australia's independent Electoral Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To those who might say this comes as a surprise: I point out the minister gave the referral more than two years ago, indicating the policy directions he was interested in exploring. The Special Minister of State has talked about this. There are transcripts available on his website of interviews going back to 26 March 2023 and 19 June 2023, and a media release of 28 November 2023 welcoming the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters' final report. He gave an interview this year on ABC <span style="font-style:italic;">Afternoon Briefing</span> in April. He gave a speech to the McKell Institute on 24 September 2024. He held a press conference announcing this legislation at the end of last week. We've had multiple inquiries and looked at this over multiple terms. We've got members speaking on the crossbench—including the member for Curtin, who sits on the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. The minister has been public about his intentions on donation and spending caps.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to how we've put this legislation together: we have put that report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters as the impact analysis, to meet the impact analysis requirements. That report itself is the impact analysis because it looked at these things so thoroughly. We had 1,496 submissions. We had hearings here in Parliament House. We had a range of community organisations here. We had four days of hearings in Parliament House, and we came back for another round, another three days, of hearings. People got to have their say. It is important to note in this debate that if the position of the crossbench is that there should be no spending cap they should just say so. That position is an unsustainable position to hold. There should be a spending cap.</span>

It is an unsustainable position. It is time to set things right. It is time to act on the recommendations of a committee report that's been on the table for a year. It is time to get this done.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:48</span>):  I remind the minister that the substance of the motion is a request for the legislation to be referred to a committee. It's not a big ask, particularly when the minister himself, in the other place, has said for months how complicated this legislation is—indeed, it's taken six months to draft. The minister stood in a press conference on Friday with the legislation in his hand and said to journalists, 'This is a very complicated piece of legislation.' I received it as I was watching the press conference and—with apologies to the forests—printed it out and brought it with me to Canberra. That and the explanatory memorandum is the equivalent of about four bricks. If Qantas had weighed my bag I probably wouldn't have been allowed onto the plane. I have not had the opportunity to go through the detail of the legislation. That is what the committee is designed to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister seems to be asking us to take this piece of legislation in good faith. I don't think this is a good-faith conversation. I say that because the major parties were happily trucking along together until they were under threat, and now suddenly it's time to change the rules without proper scrutiny. Since I've been in this place I have barely seen the two major parties cooperate on anything. Yet, now, self-interest unites a cabal of archenemies, to the detriment of the Australian public and arguably against the will of the Australian public, to entrench their collective power.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I take exception to a few things that the minister has said. Transparency—great. Real-time disclosure—great; pretty much already doing that. And no-one in this place, I think, wants to see US-style politics in this country, least of all me. But what the crossbench is asking for is a committee to analyse this evidently very complicated piece of legislation. It won't even apply to the next election. So why can't we at least have that? I'll tell you why: the major parties don't want scrutiny on this bill, because it's full of loopholes that suit them. People should know, for example, that, while expenditure caps would apply to individual candidates, the major parties could line the highways of my marginal electorate with billboards saying, 'Vote Liberal,' and, 'Vote Labor,' uncapped. Those would not come under any expenditure cap. That is not a level playing field. I say to the government and the opposition: do better to get people to vote for you. That's why people aren't voting for you. Don't change the rules to suit yourselves; send this to a committee at the very least, because this legislation could change the shape of democracy in this country for a generation and it needs close scrutiny.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:51</span>):  I want to take a moment to just reframe this debate because I think there's a lot of heat in this chamber at the moment, and rightfully so. We are all incredibly passionate advocates for our community and for our democracy, and I think there's not a single person in this building who doesn't believe that the reason this parliament operates at its best when it's operating at its best is that we come here presenting the opinions of hundreds of thousands of people. The truth of the matter is that every member in this chamber represents over 100,000 Australians. Our democracy was built on the very basis that every community should have the right to send somebody to speak for them in a way which is consistent with their voice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise today to support the member for Curtin's motion because I cannot see how it is an unreasonable motion. This reform is warranted. This reform is necessary. Australians need to know that their democracy is healthy. Australians have a right to know who is giving what money to whom, and they have a right to know how that money is being spent. You are not going to get an argument from me against that reform. What is egregious in the way that this legislation is proceeding is that—and I say this with respect to the assistant minister, through you, Deputy Chair—there has been a very long process of consultation to even get us to the point for this legislation to be tabled. There have been many voices that have been heard. We know there were hundreds of submissions on this matter made. But the report that came from the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters was incredibly high level. And there was a dissenting report. There were additional comments made to that report. It's great that we finally have a minister who said he's prepared to listen to a committee and to work with his staff to bring forward a piece of legislation. But why stop that transparency, that accountability, that reviewing process, now? This is the bit that makes no sense to me. We've done the work, we've done the consultation, the legislation is prepared—great. This parliament still has near on six months to run. May next year is when this parliament formally expires. Why is the government insisting on introducing this massive piece of legislation as of Friday—I got it on Sunday—and telling us they want it through the House this week? What I've come to learn in this place is that we do not do good policy when we seek to rush it. We do not do good policy when we're afraid to have it scrutinised. The very first Independent in my seat of North Sydney, Ted Mack, was very clear when he said that it is true that the best policy comes when the opinions of many are weighed up against the opinions of few. Whether we want to believe it or not, or whether the government wants to accept it or not, at the moment, these are the opinions of a few. These are the opinions of the government in terms of how they've listened to the JSCEM report, how they've interpreted it and how they've turned it into legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support the member for Curtin's motion to have it referred to a committee because, by doing that, we enable the opinions of many to be taken on board in terms of what this reform looks like. As a participatory democracy—a democracy that exists to represent ordinary Australians—ordinary Australians should have every right to know that this piece of legislation has been laid open in the sun for all to see and really deeply understand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not understand why, in the interests of transparency, accountability and integrity, the right course of action for this legislation is not for it to be referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and taken through an inquiry process and for a report from that committee to come back—if you want it before the next election—next March. That would still give us ample time to deal with this legislation before this parliamentary term ends.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:55</span>):  This bill, the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Reform) Bill 2024, smells like the Christmas ham on 6 January. It is a sneaky piece of legislation which is aimed at entrenching the dominance of the major political parties in this country. It looks superficially attractive, but any close examination reveals that its dominant purpose is to protect the self-interest of Labor and the coalition and to pull up the drawbridge against the Independents and the small parties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will limit donations and spending on federal elections. In principle, that is a good thing; we all want to see the financial influence on government in this country restricted. The bill will also increase the amount of taxpayers' money used to reimburse political parties and candidates, and that could be a good thing. However, caps on spending benefit those MPs who are already in this parliament over the candidates who choose to run against them at elections. They allow parties to concentrate their spending on target seats. They enable them to outspend Independent candidates in those seats.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similar legislation—we've seen it already in Victoria and New South Wales—decimated independent representation in those states, and it shored up the flagging, bloated and tired major parties. Donation caps do not prevent cash-for-access payments to ministers or to shadow ministers, and they are unlikely to limit the effect of the associated entities which now account for a third of the cash which flows to the Liberal and Labor parties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be open about this: this legislation is aimed at propping up incumbency. It's aimed at helping those people who are already in parliament to stay there, and it's aimed at stopping Independents and small parties coming on board. That is why the Labor Party and the coalition have worked together secretly for months on this legislation. They have cooked up something which they are now rushing through parliament at the last possible minute. This is not the sort of transparent, bipartisan reform that our voters would like to see, and that they deserve. It is a dodgy deal cooked up behind closed doors because the big parties are, with good reason, increasingly spooked by the Independents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation has not been subject to appropriate review, and the government does not propose to subject it to appropriate review—by either house—by parliamentary committee or by independent experts. It won't effect the 2025 election, so there is absolutely no reason to push it through with this unseemly haste. The only reason the government is doing this with the coalition is that it does not want the public to recognise how poorly the major parties are behaving with this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2022, one-third of Australian voters voted for Independents and small parties. In 2025, we will encourage them to remember this sort of cynical political manoeuvring when they decide who they can trust to represent them further.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:58</span>):  I rise today to add my voice to those in this section of the House, the crossbench, in support of the member for Curtin's call for an inquiry into this piece of legislation—a referral of it to the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Matters. We're talking about legislation. We're not talking about report that was tabled. We're not talking about some vague set of principles and ideas. We're talking about laws, and the parliament that I love is the parliament that uses all its tools to interrogate laws that will be sitting on the statute books for a long time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The community that brought me to this parliament brought me here with a very clear mandate to ask for greater scrutiny, to shine a light into dark corners, to turn up the torch and, indeed, to turn up the heat when I see something that isn't right. And when I look at this legislation, that's what I see—and so far it has only been a look. As my colleagues have said, no exposure draft was circulated to the broader parliament. There was no opportunity to look at the detail on this legislation. It seems that the only opportunity that was given to interrogate this legislation was a cosy interrogation that happened behind the closed doors of goodness knows where between the government and the opposition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Any person out in broader Australia who is listening to this debate can smell a rat. I certainly can. There are good elements to this bill—elements that I've called for, for a long time: lowering the disclosure threshold—good idea; I've been doing it since I was elected, and it's not that hard. The major parties, though, of course need to have significant investment of public funds in order to do that—on every seat, it seems, even though most funds go into a general pool. In such a piece of legislation, the details are thick—so thick that we don't want to investigate them or interrogate them through an inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think when you look at this bill you ask, 'Well, what does the label on the can say?' The label on the can says 'electoral reform'. Who could argue with that? We need it; clearly we do. We need big money to be taken out of politics; we absolutely do. We need transparency and real-time exposure of who is donating to whom and influencing policies and politicians; we do. We need a diverse parliament. How many times have I seen members of this place stand up and beat their chest about having representation from all kinds of people? But the details of this legislation, the bits the government doesn't want you to see, are really designed to make sure we can't flip a seat from an incumbent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to self-interest, this legislation is not going to affect many of us, myself included, because I am an incumbent and I have all the advantages that go with that. But I don't want to win a race that I have all the advantages in. That doesn't bring me a sense of having been the best competitor. This is not about levelling the playing field. This is about making the mountain more difficult to climb for anyone who dares to say that the major parties don't have all the answers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was an opportunity for this government to be statespeople, an opportunity to show the Australian public what integrity is all about, what courage is all about, by saying: 'Do you know what? The Australian people have lost so much faith in their democracy and we're going to help to restore it. But when it comes to the scrutiny, well, we're not going to allow that, actually. We're not going to circulate an exposure draft for the whole parliament to see. No: we're going to introduce a bill into the House of Representatives. We're going to drop it on a Friday. Maybe some of the Independents will get their hands on it on the weekend and then cause a bit of a fuss on a Monday'—and here we are, doing that; I'm glad that we have fulfilled that destiny—'and then we're going to ram it through the House as quickly as we can.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Won't it be fascinating to see who's on the speaking list when we have this debate? How many members of the coalition will stand up and call for greater scrutiny? How many members of the government will stand up and look to the detail, look to those pages of exclusions when it comes to the definition of a gift? I'll be very curious to see who's on the speaking list, actually.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just imagine, as one of my colleagues, the member for Goldstein, said, if we saw the two major parties walking into this chamber in a spirit of collaboration on some of the big existential questions this parliament faces. Just imagine: they've gone away together on a little camp, perhaps, and come together into the parliament with strong evidence based, scientifically backed policy on climate change and are saying, 'Australia, this is what we're going to do, and we're going to do it together.' Just imagine that. We'd all be here cheering. But no, we're not doing that.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is one of those moments, really—if a person was a bit cynical; I don't know why they would be out there in constituency land!—that feels like a Deirdre Chambers 'what a coincidence' moment: we're in the chamber today with the two major parties coming together with this wonderful gift for democracy that's called electoral reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, I fully support this legislation going to the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Matters. If it is as good as the minister has told us it is, and he's really confident, then he won't be afraid of scrutiny. He'll be welcoming it. He'll be using every parliamentary tool there is because there's no rush on this, is there? No rush whatsoever! The only rush is to get truth in political advertising, and we're not going near that. The only rush is to get real-time political donation transparency—no rush on that either, it seems. But there's a big rush on making sure that we lock this in before the potential for perhaps a different make-up in the chamber, come the outcome of the next election, when it may not be so easy to do a cosy deal. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will pause here and allow others to speak. My central contention here right now is that, if this bill is as good as the government says, then let's not just leave it to trust; let's leave it to scrutiny, which is what a parliament's all about.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="M3C" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:05</span>):  You've always got to be careful when this parliament heads towards Christmas, because that's when Labor and Liberal try and put a lump of coal in the democracy stocking. Their rushed legislation is very often bad legislation. We just heard the minister say that this was—I think I'm quoting him correctly—the largest reform in 40 years of the foundations of the way that our democracy works. The motion that we're debating right now—it's important for people who are listening to understand this—is not about whether we're voting for or against that bill or whether there are good provisions, bad provisions or provisions that need to be improved in it; it's about whether there should be any inquiry into whether the bill does what it says on the tin.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, it is the usual practice in this place that, when bills are brought here, a committee of one house or another, or in this instance both, scrutinises that legislation. That's the normal course. It's especially the normal course when very significant pieces of legislation are brought here. What we've seen, in the way that this chamber has worked in the past, is that, when bills are allowed to go through that process of scrutiny, they are very often improved. Not only that but you often find flaws in the bill that were unintended. That is why we have this process that has worked this way for a very long time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is even more important when you're passing legislation that, on the government's own admission, has no need for urgency because it won't affect this coming election but will affect the one after that. That's what the government has said. So there's absolutely no justification for not doing the thing that we do with pretty much every other piece of legislation in this place, which is to have an inquiry into it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For a very, very long time the Greens in this place, together with others, including others who have spoken here today and others who have come before, have been arguing strongly that the rules around who gets to fund and, in many instances, 'own' politicians in this place need to change—that we need greater transparency and we need greater disclosure. We have argued that for a very long time. As others, including here on the crossbench, have said, there are some good measures in what the government is proposing, in many instances because they've picked up measures that we've all been advocating for a very long time. But there's a lot more in the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the point was made, one of the other things that I think most people would expect should exist in our laws, truth in advertising, is not part of this rush. It's not part of the rush. So the onus is really on the government to explain why, in what they are calling the largest reform in 40 years, they want to bypass the standard practice of this parliament and not have any scrutiny of the bills whatsoever. One of the things they might say—and I saw the minister shaking his head at the table before, saying, 'No, there is an urgency.' Let's just take that for a moment. Let's assume that the government is right. Something else—and it's critical that people listening understand this—is that, when the government has brought legislation to parliament before and said that they need to get this through in, say, a week, even then they've had inquiries into it. Now, sometimes those inquiries have run for just a couple of days. In one of those instances—we saw it here this year in parliament—the government brought a piece of legislation in. We in the Senate managed to secure an inquiry into it. Through that inquiry, so many problems were found in the bill that the government pulled it altogether and hasn't even brought it back, if I recall correctly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Inquiries into legislation can do their job and often find problems in it that even the government and this parliament have used to say, 'Okay, we may not progress the bill,' or, 'We're going to fix it.' In the context where people are raising some very serious concerns about what it means for democracy to entrench a two-party system, to use this to try to effectively tilt the playing field so a certain outcome is more likely than a different outcome in a way that affects the will of the people—given the seriousness of that, that is all the more reason for there to be an inquiry into this legislation. I think the test that most people in this country now will have for every piece of legislation that comes past here, especially legislation that's about changing the rules of the game, is: does this legislation allow for more voices in parliament or not? They'll also be asking: does this piece of legislation make the parliament work in a way where different voices have to come together, fix the problems that we're facing as a country and get outcomes that make my life better? That's the test. That's the test that most people increasingly have for the laws that pass this parliament. That is a fair test and it is a right test.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are in a situation at the moment—and I've said it several times before—where less than a third of the country voted for this government. A bit more than a third voted for the opposition and about a third is voting for someone else. There are two ways you can deal with that. You can deal with that by saying, 'We'd better have a listen to what that third of the country that's voting for someone else is saying and maybe lift our game and put forward some policies that might actually make people's lives better,' or you can say, 'We'll just try and change the rules of the game.' If this legislation is as good as the government says it is then they will have nothing to hide from an inquiry. If it's that good then let people run the ruler over it. This practice that we're getting into where we're saying that we can't even scrutinise legislation in this place anymore is very concerning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've got views about this bill. It's been tabled now, but there will be other people who will have views about this bill, and they should be given a chance to be heard. Ordinarily, when any other bill comes up, there's a chance for people such as the experts, the people who've had lived experience of something or people that are going to be affected by the bill to have their say in an inquiry. That's the usual process. As I've said, people can often find flaws in the bill that no-one even knew were there. You get a chance to fix that by having scrutiny. Critically, it gives people a chance to have their say. Nothing I've heard from the government so far can put forward any legitimate reason as to why we should be denying people a chance to have their say and some scrutiny into this legislation. Yes, we have a view, as the Greens, about what the rules of the game here should be to ensure that this parliament starts to reflect the will of the Australian people accurately and does not distort it, but, even if you don't agree with me and take the government's view at face value, that's still no reason for excluding people from the right to have scrutiny of a bill and their right to have a say, and that's what this motion is about. This motion is not actually about the merits of this bill or about whether or not it props up a two-party system. That's not what this motion is about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion is about: whether or not the usual practice, which applies to just about every other bill in this place, should apply to this one as well; whether there should be an inquiry into it, to find the flaws that the government didn't even know were there; and hearing arguments that may force a bit of a rethink—when you think, 'I didn't think about that,' or, 'Maybe we do need to fix that.' Nothing put forward by this minister today makes one single case for removing people's rights to have a look at this bill which, as the minister himself has said, is the largest reform in 40 years. It won't affect what happens at this election, only the one after that. So I support this motion.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:15</span>):  I rise in support of the motion today from the member for Curtin for this electoral reform legislation to be referred for scrutiny by a parliamentary committee. If ever there was a piece of legislation that should be referred for further scrutiny, this is probably it. It goes to the heart of our democracy. Our democracy is our greatest strength and our greatest asset. A piece of legislation as complex and as important as this must be scrutinised by a parliamentary committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Curtin's request is a very simple and reasonable request. As we've heard from other members on the crossbench, there is no rush. There is no reason why it can't go through that inquiry, why the experts can't scrutinise it and why it can't be interrogated. This is our democracy, and we know that democracy is fragile. We can never take it for granted. We see what's happening in other nations whose democracies have a strong and long history and who are also becoming more and more polarised. That is something that we do not want to see in this country. We saw at the last election and at other recent elections a growing diversity in our parliament. More eyes, more voices, more debate—that is what makes our democracy strong.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of us here on the crossbench are concerned, as are many people across the nation, that this legislation may undermine our democracy—maybe in an unintended way, but it may. So we absolutely need to scrutinise the proper process for one of the most important pieces of legislation that has come in this term. As the minister himself has said, it must be scrutinised in a parliamentary committee. It must have proper process. Our democracy is our strongest asset. There is no rush. We must do everything to keep it a strong and as vibrant as possible.</span>

As has been demonstrated by multiple events in recent years, cybersecurity incidents have the potential to compromise the privacy and security of millions of Australians, enabling fraud and extortion on a scale that was not previously possible. Even more seriously, hostile nation-states are increasingly seeing cyber vulnerabilities as a possible means to sabotage critical infrastructure and damage Australia's interests in a time of conflict.</span>

As cyberwarfare expert James Scott said, 'There's no silver bullet with cybersecurity; a layered defence is the only viable option.' But the reality is that more must be done. To that end, the Cyber Security Legislative Package aims to continue the world-leading work of the former coalition government to boost Australia's cybersecurity capabilities. It consists of three bills: the Cyber Security Bill 2024, the Intelligence Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Cyber Security) Bill 2024 and the Security of Critical Infrastructure and Other Legislation Amendment (Enhanced Response and Prevention) Bill 2024. Collectively these bills provide a suite of measures intended—</span>

The redistribution has, sadly, meant that the shires of York, Toodyay and Northam will no longer be in Durack. It has been a real privilege to represent these communities, but I have the utmost confidence that the fantastic Liberal candidate for Bullwinkel, Matt Moran, will be elected. He will become a terrific representative.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I'm very much looking forward to welcoming back many of the areas that I previously proudly represented prior to the 2022 redistribution. These include constituents in the following shires: Cunderdin, Kellerberrin, Koorda, Merredin, Mount Marshall, Mukinbudin, Nungarin, Tammin, Trayning, Westonia and not forgetting the wonderful people in the shire of Wyalkatchem.</span>

These returning communities are particularly impacted by Labor's planned abolition of the live sheep trade and failures to support regional Australia. I've already begun reconnecting with locals across these areas as I look to reinvigorate my old electorate office in Merredin, so look out for that. I do look forward to, hopefully, having the opportunity to reconnect and to be the representative for what we call the 'old new Durack'.</span>

Education is the underpinning of individuals having the chance to realise their potential. It is also the pathway out of cycles of disadvantage for so many. The Albanese government's recent announcements in relation to education policy are game-changers.</span>

Secondly, we'll be raising the threshold people can earn before they need to start repaying their loans. Almost 20 per cent of people in my electorate have a HECS debt. They will directly benefit from these changes. These changes, on top of already-legislated changes to the way HECS is indexed, will help immediately with cost of living and, by reducing debt, will enable more home loan applications.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has also ensured that fee-free TAFE is here to stay. This will enable training for more tradespeople, more carers and so many other professions that our society needs. It will reduce barriers for more Australians not only to progress their own lives but also to build Australia's future. Employment projections show that 90 per cent of future jobs will require postsecondary education. Therefore, it is extremely important that universities and TAFEs are accessible and affordable and that barriers to opportunity are lessened, as this is what will reduce cycles of generational disadvantage. These changes to HECS and TAFE will enable so many more people to attend university and TAFE, especially in communities like mine. This is both fairer and better for the economy.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  I'm delighted to amplify Nicola's voice today, as part of our Raise Our Voice in Parliament program. This year young people across the country were asked what they wanted their community to look like in the next 10 years and what this parliament could do to achieve it. In Nicola's words:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Stable and positive mental health is crucial for our well-being, yet it is often overlooked. I've seen friends struggle silently, unable to find the help they need. This needs to change. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In ten years, I envision a community where mental health support is accessible to everyone and as readily available as physical health services. Where schools have dedicated mental health professionals, and workplaces provide regular mental wellness programs. This change would create a supportive environment, reduce stigma, and save lives. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The next Parliament can help achieve this by increasing funding for mental health services, implementing mandatory mental health education in schools, and supporting initiatives that promote mental wellness in all areas of life. This isn't just a personal issue; it's a community issue that affects us all. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Ultimately a future with robust mental health support will create a stronger, healthier community. I urge our politicians to prioritise mental health, ensuring no one has to suffer in silence</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you, Nicola, for your wonderful words. I wholeheartedly agree and I think you show a great commitment to our community and what can be achieved in our parliament. It's certainly something to keep on aiming for. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  Destination Wollongong has been instrumental in promoting tourism and economic growth in the Wollongong region. This not-for-profit organisation works closely with local government, businesses and community partners to attract visitors to our area. Through strategic marketing, event coordination, and partnership building, Destination Wollongong enhances Wollongong's profile, contributes to the local economy, and showcases Wollongong's unique attractions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to make a special mention of their former general manager, Mark Sleigh, for his role in promoting Wollongong as a prime tourism destination over the past decade. For the past 12 years, under his leadership, the city has gained recognition not only for its natural beauty but also for hosting some world-class events. In 2016, through Destination Wollongong, Mark welcomed the first cruise ships to be docked at Port Kembla, allowing visitors to explore Wollongong and surrounding attractions. He was a key advocate for the 2022 UCI Road World Championships and the upcoming World Triathlon Championship in 2025. Through hosting these events, Destination Wollongong has significantly boosted Wollongong's international profile. Mark's dedication to enhance Wollongong's tourism can be seen through his work to build a vibrant night-time economy and through his promoting of key sporting events like the National Youth Championships. </span>

With indexation through the roof, their HECS debts are growing faster than they can pay them off. I went to uni for free, and so did the Prime Minister. Today's students though are paying through the nose for an education—not fair. The Greens have been fighting for years to wipe student debt completely to ease this massive burden on young people particularly. Now, Labor's finally listening, promising a 20 per cent reduction in HECS balances and raising the payment threshold. But why wait until after the election? With the Greens' support, Labor has the numbers to deliver their promise right now. Students and graduates need cost-of-living relief right now, not in some hypothetical future. They should not have to wait. Labor could wipe student debt completely by wiping tax handouts to massive corporations and shifting their focus to helping everyday Australians. Instead, they're playing politics with people's lives in the middle of one of the worst cost-of-living crises in decades. The Greens are willing to work with Labor to offer real relief for thousands of people with HECS debts right now. What is Labor scared of?</span>

The good news for my community is, through a joint partnership between our government and the NRMA, a $40 million grant has gone towards building supercharging EV stations all throughout Australia—in particular, from Melbourne to Adelaide. The town of Marong in my electorate will host one of these supercharging stations. I went out to visit the EV charging station that we have in Marong, and it was already in use. So there was hardly a moment to celebrate its switching on; people were already logging on to the app to see that they could supercharge their EVs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been great news for the local community, with regular people visiting the Marong Family Hotel and the Elmore Bakery, which have an outlet in Marong. It is a little hamlet that is fast becoming part of Bendigo's growing suburbs. We talked to Trish, who was a local using the EV charging station on this day. She said, 'It's just great to be able to charge your car quicker than getting a coffee from the Elmore Bakery.' Whilst we were there, people from Melbourne were using this service. This is what our government is doing—investing in EV charging stations.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hume</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  As real disposable incomes have gone backwards, many Australians are not just feeling poorer; they are poorer. This is a direct quote from the final report of the Senate Select Committee on the Cost of Living: following a two-year inquiry, the report confirms that Australians are 'worse off' under the Albanese Labor government. In the 2½ years that Labor has been in power, our standards of living here in Australia have collapsed more than any other advanced country. We are at the back of the pack. Why? Let me read another direct quote from the report:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the Labor Government's unnecessary and undisciplined spending continues and perpetuates the cost of living crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They have made the cost-of-living crisis go on for longer than it needs to. This demonstrates what we all know: that Australia's inflation crisis is home grown, and it's hardworking Australian families who are paying the highest price. Since Labor came to office, a typical Australian family with a mortgage is paying an extra $35,000 from after-tax income in repayments, electricity prices are up $1,000—that's despite the $250-cut promise—and, whether it's the food they buy from the supermarket or the insurance they pay on their homes, their vehicles or the everyday services that they need, it's all costing a whole lot more under Labor. This government is asleep at the wheel, talking about plans for plans and continuing to spend, spend, spend.</span>

In my electorate as well, Charles Darwin University is enhancing its Indonesia focus. But I'm worried about our primary and secondary schools. I met with the Chair of the Australia-Indonesia Institute Board in the last sitting, Emeritus Professor Greg Fealy. Regrettably, Indonesian language studies are declining in our schools and, outside of our fine jurisdictions, in universities too. This is a matter of concern to us and also to the Indonesian government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It should be of great concern to all of us. If we stop teaching Indonesian in primary and secondary schools, then we will lose our Bahasa teachers and lose our nation's expertise. Unfortunately, it has been confirmed that a second private secondary school in my electorate is going to stop teaching Indonesian for lack of Indonesian teachers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is this important? Mengapa? Why? It is because Indonesia will enter the top 10 economies in the world by the next decade and will be a top-five economy by 2040. And, by the way, they are our closest neighbours, so, as they become an economic powerhouse and as we concentrate on our South-East Asian economic strategy, Indonesia is simply so important. Let's start learning their language again.</span>

A group of Australian Defence Force ex-servicewomen in Barker are telling her story in schools and community groups to give her the recognition she deserves. Local Barker veteran Liz Wheeler, who had the privilege of meeting Nancy before she died, is leading the charge with a group of women who will undertake the same 520-kilometre bike ride Nancy endured during the war, riding through what was then German-occupied France.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nancy arrived in France just prior to World War II. She joined the French Resistance and saved the lives of countless Jewish civilians and Allied servicemen. Liz and her group had sought funding through the Department of Veterans' Affairs, but have been denied support because the commemoration of Nancy's heroism will not take place on Australian soil but in France as they retrace Nancy's steps. I ask the minister opposite to reassess that request for funding. Minister, reconsider this decision and help acknowledge and recognise an unsung but well-deserving heroine.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I joined Liz and her group on Saturday to help raise money through a sausage sizzle at the Mount Gambier pageant. Congratulations to Liz and the women joining her in France. This commemorative ride is an opportunity to honour and promote an Australian female hero in circumstances where female heroines go too often unrecognised in this country.</span>

Let me give you just three recent examples.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, I'm delighted that Macquarie Fields in Werriwa will be home to one of the 10 new suburban university study hubs. Study hubs will provide student support and campus-style facilities for those studying a university or TAFE course without needing to leave their community. The study hub will encourage more young Australians to not only enrol in postsecondary education but also finish their studies. Secondly, the Albanese Labor government will support the national VET system by continuing to offer free TAFE places. The first 18 months of fee-free TAFE has seen over 508,000 enrolments. Labor believes in equal opportunity and, by making TAFE free, we're removing the financial barriers to access and ensuring everyone has a chance to achieve their potential. Finally, at a university level, the Albanese Labor government has announced a raft of measures regarding HECS, not least being a further cut of 20 per cent to all student debt.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  The housing crisis under Labor is just getting worse. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has shown again that the housing crisis is being exacerbated by terrible decisions of this government and their 1.2-million-home promise. The so-called promise of 1.2 million homes is going to fall 400,000 homes short. This compares to the more than a million homes that were commenced under the coalition between 2017 and 2021.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To put this into some context, the Labor Party is bringing in record levels of migration—nearly half a million migrants a year—when we're building fewer homes. Only 158,000 homes were approved last financial year—with more than half a million new migrants. You don't need to be a genius to know that this government has no plan for where those record levels of immigrants will be living. We've seen median rents in this country increase by 23 per cent. Australians are paying 23 per cent more in rent, $632 on average per week, as a result of the migration policy of this government. Australians with a mortgage are paying over $20,000 a year more in interest repayments because inflation has remained elevated due to the poor decisions of this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only a coalition government after the next election will ensure that housing is available for all Australians to purchase or rent.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  Education is the driving force of social mobility in our country. Labor is committed to strengthening our education system and rebuilding the tertiary sector. We inherited a system on the brink of collapse after a decade of neglect by the former Liberal-National government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no better example of our commitment to the sector than Labor's fee-free TAFE program. This program has enabled thousands of Australians to upskill in crucial areas such as child care, aged care and construction. We are also reducing university costs for millions of Australians, slashing $3 billion from student debt and making the repayment systems fairer. If re-elected, Labor will go further, cutting student debt by an additional $16 billion to ease the cost-of-living pressures and boost productivity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is about supporting young Australians because no-one should be burdened with a lifetime of debt to gain the skills our economy needs. This is tangible cost-of-living relief—relief the Liberals have called wasteful and voted against. Labor is delivering real support and building a stronger education system for Australia's future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">La Trobe</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  I would like to welcome Emma Vulin MP and her partner, Matt, to the chamber today and also acknowledge the member for Bruce, Julian Hill, who has been taking her around and has known Emma since the age of 12.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I first got to meet Emma at Carrum Downs prior to the last state election, and I must admit that, after meeting Emma, I thought, 'There's not a nicer person I could meet—a CFA volunteer.' I was very concerned you would actually win the seat of Pakenham from the Liberals, which you did. Over the time I've known Emma, I've always had all these injuries, and Emma and I have compared stories. In actual fact, I recommended a surgeon to her!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the sad thing, the reality, is that Emma has motor neurone disease. You've been absolutely incredible, going to citizenship functions with us and also to a Remembrance Day service last week. Even when we had the motor neurone disease Walk to Support event recently, you were more worried about how I would go around the lake, and yet you were in a wheelchair.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Emma, you're an inspiration to all of us and all those other 2,000 in Australia who have MND. I thank you and Matt and your family; you've gone through hell and back. You are a fighter and an inspiration, and it's very sad to see what you are going through, but we all walk in your shoes. Thank you so much.</span>

It was a fantastic afternoon with a brilliant turnout by our community and a lot of action on the pitch. We saw this humble member weave five overs of pure magic with the ball.

We saw Damian McGee, the well-loved proprietor of the Exchange Hotel in Gawler, named man of the match. He's not quite Damian Martyn, having also been bowled for a duck, but, most importantly, he raised the most funds out of all players, with a total of $32,000 going towards people sleeping rough.</span>

We called in on Heidi and Pavo Walker from Walker Seafoods, who are one of the fishers of Fisher! They are at Mooloolaba and are the largest fresh caught tuna fishers in Australia. While talking with Heidi, she asked the deputy opposition leader this question: when did the government declare war on small business? While there's been no formal declaration of war against small business by this government, Heidi Walker, I think, exemplified the feelings of just about every small business in this country when she asked that question—when did the government declare war on small business? Small businesses around this country are bleeding. They are bleeding from the government red tape. They are bleeding from the cost of living. The cost of living does not just impact households; it impacts small-business people, particularly in relation to the energy prices, and the regulatory costs that small businesses are enduring, driving unprecedented numbers of them to the wall.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  The Minister for Education and I have something in common. We were the first people in our family to go to university. And I have something in common with you, Deputy Speaker Claydon, in that the beautiful University of Newcastle is in your electorate, and in 1989, I attended that university for the first time, as the first person in my family. Driving to uni in those days was probably about 45 minutes. Well, it's gotten a lot busier and a lot harder to get to the University of Newcastle, because we know a lot of people want to live in our magnificent region. That is why I'm so delighted to be part of a government that is doing the Suburban University Study Hubs. For the Kurri Kurri community centre, we have now announced that we are going to set up a university hub.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kurri Kurri is my hometown, but in the wisdom of the Australian Electoral Commission, they have redistributed it to the seat of Hunter, and the member for Hunter will now be taking over looking after my beautiful hometown of Kurri Kurri, and I know he is going to do a magnificent job. But I just want to say to all of those students that are going to come from Heddon Greta, Maitland, Cessnock or wherever they are coming from to study at the Kurri community centre, as a Labor government university study hub, it is going to be such a great place. You won't have to battle for parking at uni. There'll be other people who will be studying university courses and trying to get assessments in. It is going to be a great thing. Enjoy the university study hub at Kurri Kurri.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:57</span>):  Today I'm launching a petition calling on the Albanese Labor government to invest in Australia's, and Victoria's, road network. The lack of funding and the cutting to maintenance across our road network are seeing our road network collapse before our eyes. It's collapsing before our eyes, and it is a shame. Once again, all it goes to show is that the Albanese Labor government has its priorities wrong. What it should be doing is immediately investing in our rural road network, in particular. How, in good conscious, can you be cutting funding to our regional and rural roads?</span>

                  </a>  I hear an interjection from the minister for infrastructure. Why won't you fund the Princes Highway on an 80-20 ratio? Why have you dropped that back to a fifty-fifty ratio? That means that you are cutting road funding on that major network that runs right through my electorate. It's not only that; we're seeing the Victorian state government reduce maintenance funding by 95 per cent. It's a disaster, and the real concern and the real worry is it is starting to cost people's lives. We're starting to see the road toll increase. You need to fix our road network starting today. Do it now.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:59</span>):  I want to share a story of Claire from Ryde which tells us exactly what Labor's free TAFE program is all about. Claire has spent years in an industry she's fallen out of love with, but she stayed there because she had to pay her bills and provide for her family. She's wanted to change jobs for a while, but the cost of reskilling was a barrier for her, because not everyone has a couple of thousand dollars laying around. That's where Labor governments come in. Thanks to our commitment to working families and to addressing skills shortages, Claire has enrolled in a free TAFE course. She is now building new skills and setting her insights on starting a small business in her new profession. And she's not alone: over 500,000 Aussies have enrolled in fee-free TAFE, and we want to make that permanent. Free TAFE means more people like Claire, no matter their background, can access better wages and reskill. Under Labor, we want Claire to reskill, to earn more and to keep more of what she earns.</span>

Since coming to government, what this government has understood is that the cheapest form of energy today is renewable energy. That is why we have increased renewables in the grid by 25 per cent. In doing so, we are on target to both put downward pressure on energy prices and meet our emissions reduction target by 2030.</span>

What this man is doing and what those opposite are doing is doubling down on the single most expensive form of electricity which exists in the world today.

                  </a>  A point of order on relevance, it was a very tight question—can the government guarantee that Australians will not face an increase in energy prices as a result of Labor's secret target? If the Acting Prime Minister cannot give that guarantee, he should sit down. What he's saying now is not relevant.</span>

He can do some compare and contrast, but I'm going to draw him back to the question.</span>

                  </a>  We face the prospect of what policies are on offer and what polices we reject. One of the critical policies which has been put forward by those opposite is in respect of nuclear power, and that is a policy that we will not pursue because we will be focused on increasing more renewables into the grid. The prospect that those opposite are suggesting, which will not see any new electricity in the grid for many years to come and, and its peak, will represent about four per cent of the energy grid, is a prospect we will completely reject.</span>

That's why we provided energy relief to every household around the country. We did so in the face of opposition from this man and did so in the face of opposition from those opposite. I can guarantee to the honourable member that, in the Albanese government, there is a government which will be focused each and every day on reducing the energy prices and putting downward pressure on the energy prices of Australian households.</span>

Global inflation in the aftermath of the pandemic and with conflicts in different parts of the world is impacting every nation. Wherever you go, there are communities around the world which are feeling the pinch. That is no different here in Australia. We know Australians are doing it tough and there is more to be done. We offer a government which is utterly focused each and every day on the household budgets of every Australian.</span>

                  </a>  in the war on inflation was prudent economic management, which is why in our two years in office we have produced two surpluses putting downward pressure on inflation, and that is starting to work. We inherited from those opposite an inflation rate of 6.1 per cent. Indeed, in their last full quarter in office the quarterly inflation rate was 2.1 per cent—the highest this century. Now the inflation rate is down to 2.8 per cent annually, within the RBA band.</span>

That has been done in the face of the opposition of this man. If the Leader of the Opposition had had his way, the average household in this country would now be $7,000 worse off. The only idea they have in terms of budget management is $315 billion worth of cuts—that's the age pension, that's bulk-billing, that's Medicare.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fairfax</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:09</span>):  My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. The Albanese Labor government has claimed that its renewables-only plan would cost $122 billion, but the real price tag is over $642 billion. That's more than five times as expensive. Why is this weak and incompetent Labor government hiding the true cost from Australian families, who will have to foot the bill for its renewables-only plan?</span>

It is clear in the world today, whether those opposite understand it or not, that the cheapest form of electricity is renewable electricity. That's why we have got the renewables sector going again—something that those opposite did their best to absolutely crush and, in the process of which, were doing everything they could to see upward pressure on energy prices in this country. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we have got investment in renewables going again, such that there is a 25 per cent increase in the grid. We are doing that in terms of putting downward pressure on energy prices. What those opposite have to offer is a $600 billion nuclear plan which will cost Australian households an additional $1,200 a year, because it is understood around the world to be the single most expensive form of energy today. And there is no prospect of that energy coming onto the grid for years and years to come, and, when it does, it will represent about four per cent of the electricity grid.</span>

That's what we are doing, because that is what every responsible economy on the planet is doing. The only other option that you hear in the developed world is—literally—from those opposite, talking about establishing a civil nuclear industry from scratch at an enormous cost to Australian households, and that is a policy we will not pursue.</span>

We understand, even if those opposite don't, that cash can be a really important lifeline. Cash can be an important backup. Cash can give people a sense of security, a sense of peace of mind, knowing that they have cash there as a backup. And we want to maintain that as an option and as an ongoing feature of our economy. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We intend to do what a lot of other countries have done and what a lot of states and jurisdictions in the US have done, and that is to make sure that cash is acceptable, when people are buying things from supermarkets, pharmacies or petrol stations, and in other ways. You would think that those opposite would enthusiastically support our efforts to give people that peace of mind—but, sadly, no. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know, from Senator Hume this morning, that those opposite don't support our efforts to maintain an ongoing role for cash in our economy. She made that clear. What that means, the logical conclusion of that, is that those opposite are a risk to cash in our economy in the same way that this opposition leader is a risk to household budgets more broadly. We know that they're a risk because we know their record when it comes to Medicare, when it comes to housing and when it comes to wages—and now, when it comes to a role for cash in the economy as an important backup. He is a risk, this opposition leader, to household budgets, because we know his record and we know that his reckless arrogance was set Australians back in tangible ways. </span>

She has asked about my private member's bill entitled Lobbying (Improving Government Honesty and Trust) Bill, also known as the 'clean up politics bill'. This bill introduces several measures to improve trust in government decision-making, including an extension of the register of lobbyists, publication of ministers' diaries and closure of the revolving door between ministries and the private sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member asked whether there is urgency in debating this bill, and there is. I first placed this bill before the House last year. It was not debated. With the help of Senator David Pocock we secured a Senate inquiry into the bill. That received 346 submissions but received only a single day of hearings. That inquiry concluded that the government should improve its regulation of lobbyists' activities in this house. The government has not done so, and it has not indicated any plan to do so. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this 47th Parliament the member for Indi and many of my crossbench colleagues have placed integrity measures before this House: bills to stop pork-barrelling; bills for truth in political advertising; bills for meaningful and equitable reform of electoral donations—we've seen what goes on with that; bills that stop jobs for mates; and bills to protect whistleblowers. Not one of those bills has been debated by this government.</span>

                  </a>  Standing order 99 permits members to ask when bills might be debated. This government has not debated a single private member's bill in this 47th Parliament. I want to reverse the onus and I want to ask the government—I want to ask the Acting Prime Minister and the Attorney-General—when they will act. I would like them to tell my electorate and the electorates of the other members of the crossbench when and how they are going to take action to restore Australia's faith in the integrity, transparency and honesty of its government.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hotham</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Housing and Minister for Homelessness</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:22</span>):  I want to thank the fantastic member for Tangney for his question. He's just a brilliant representative for his community. The Albanese government has the boldest and most ambitious housing agenda that the Commonwealth has had for decades—a landmark $32 billion to help Australians manage this huge problem in our lives. We're helping Australians to build, build, build; we're helping to get a better deal for renters; and we're helping more Australians to realise the dream of homeownership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member suggested, building more homes is at the very centre of our agenda because more homes means more affordable housing for Australians, and all of us in this chamber know that there are a lot of people in our communities doing it tough. All of us in this chamber have met families who are moving their kids from rental to rental, some of them having to disrupt the school year while they do it. We've got working families with mortgages who are really feeling the pressure, and a whole generation of young people out there who are increasingly saying to us that they feel that homeownership is out of reach for them permanently. It's not good for them and it's not good for the country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we came to office 2½ years ago, on housing, the cupboard was absolutely bare. There was a lack of Commonwealth ambition, there was a lack of Commonwealth action and, for most of that time, there was a lack of a Commonwealth housing minister. So the Albanese government stepped strongly into that void and, through our Prime Minister, negotiated an ambitious target of building 1.2 million homes over five years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're working with the states and territories to make it easier to build homes; we're funding infrastructure to unlock greenfield sites; we're training more tradies to build those homes, with more than 35,000 construction related courses being taken up through fee-free TAFE; we've expanded homeownership opportunities, with more than 130,000 Australians helped into homeownership since we've been in office; and we're supporting the construction of more social and affordable homes. Speaker, you might have missed this one when we announced the first round of the Housing Australia Future Fund: in round 1 alone, we will build more social and affordable homes than the coalition did in their entire decade in office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a problem 30 years in the making. It's not going to get solved overnight. But what you have here in Canberra is a government with fierce resolve. We are throwing everything we can at this problem, and we're making real progress in the face of very significant opposition—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's going to be a real choice at the next election when it comes to housing, with an opposition whose nasty negativity and reckless arrogance has probably affected housing policy as much as any issue facing the country. We're in the middle of a massive transformation program here, helping Australians build, rent and buy. All that is going to be at risk if the member opposite becomes the leader of our country.</span>

The biggest risk is a nuclear energy policy that, by their own admission, won't be operational for 20 years and then will only provide four per cent of power—and it will cost $600 billion and it will add $1,200 to the average person's household bills.</span>

And what did they do in response to those 24 coal-fired power stations that gave their closure dates to those opposite? They did nothing. They did absolutely nothing in response to the delays telegraphed while they were in government. They had 22 separate energy policies. They didn't land a single one. </span>

That's why every member of this government is focused primarily on the cost of living and getting inflation down, and that's why progress has been so important. Inflation was 6.1. As the Deputy Prime Minister said, it's now more than half—back in the band for the first time since 2021. Underlying inflation is moderating. The Reserve Bank have lowered their forecast for inflation. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we came to office, real wages were falling substantially. They are now growing—four quarters in a row. The gender pay gap has narrowed as well. A million jobs have been created. Unemployment is still in the low fours. Participation is at record highs. Our economy has continued to grow while most of the OECD has had one or more negative quarters of growth. Every taxpayer is getting a tax cut, and we're rolling out cost-of-living relief. And we've delivered two budget surpluses for the first time in almost two decades and saved $150 billion in Liberal debt. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, we've done all this without the support of those opposite but also without losing sight of the bigger structural issues in our economy at the same time. We do have that primary focus on the cost of living, but we're also focused on making our economy more productive. We had seen the weakest decade for productivity growth under those opposite in more than half a century. We want to turn that around, not with their approach, which is to make people work longer for less, but with our approach of boosting competition in our economy, building a more skilled workforce, harnessing data and digital technology, delivering care more efficiently, and maximising the benefits of the net zero energy transformation. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government already have a big and ambitious agenda when it comes to productivity, but we also made three new announcements in the last week alone: a $900 million productivity fund with the states to incentivise economic reform; a new single front door for major investors to get capital flowing more effectively in our economy; and PC inquiries for each of the five pillars of productivity to help inform the next steps. And we'll have more to say about productivity and investment in and around the investor roundtable on Friday and the Treasurers meeting the Friday after that. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians know our priorities are cost of living and inflation, budget repair and investing in the future, but they also know that they will go backwards if this opposition leader unleashes his risky and reckless arrogance on the Australian economy. I was asked about alternatives, but we are deep into the third year of a three-year parliamentary term and they still have no costed coherent or credible economic policies. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr MARLES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corio</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:40</span>):  The short answer is I don't accept the assertions which were contained in the question that was asked by the honourable member. What we see around the world is that the cheapest form of electricity today is firmed renewable electricity, and, if you go to any developed economy on the planet, they are investing in firmed renewable energy. That is how the world is walking down the pathway of decarbonising. That is how modern nations are engaging in the economic transformation which puts them at the frontier of technology, and that is what this government is going to navigate as well. And it is doing so through increasing renewables in our grid, and through increasing investment in the renewable sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The series of questions that we have had from those opposite makes it plain for every Australian to see that this is a party which is opposed to renewable energy. What is absolutely clear is that this is a party still wrestling with itself and the Nationals about whether climate change is actually happening at all. This is a party which is stubbornly and determinedly refusing to move with where the planet needs us to go and needs governments to go. It is an opposition which is refusing to acknowledge the conversation which is happening in Baku this week, as it has happened each and every year, about transitioning our globe and facing one of the great challenges in our lifetime.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are going to do that because we understand the importance of Australia's contribution to reducing global emissions, but, more than that, what we understand is that a fair and efficient transition, in terms of decarbonising our economy, is what is in the nation's economic interest, and that is what we are pursuing. And we are doing that by pursuing the cheapest form of energy out there, which is firmed renewable energy. Those opposite, and the member in particular, are out there championing, along with the Leader of the Opposition, an idea of pursuing nuclear energy, which we won't see for 20 years, which is the single most expensive form of energy on the planet, which will see an increase in household electricity bills of $1,200 and, when it's all said and done, might—might!—contribute four per cent to our electricity grid. Those opposite can be completely stuck in the past when it comes to these policies, as they were for an entire lost decade, as we saw 22 different energy policies which took this country nowhere. On this side of the House, we have intent, we have a direction and we are transitioning this country to a cleaner, better, more prosperous future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blaxland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Education</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:43</span>):  I thank my friend the wonderful member for Werriwa for her question. Today, the Senate is debating legislation that will wipe $3 billion of HECS debt for more than three million Australians. This is the bill that fixes that spike in HECS indexation that happened last year. It wipes that out and it makes sure that this never happens again, and it is the first step in making HECS fairer. The next step is what we announced a couple of weeks ago. If we win the next election, we will cut all student debts by a further 20 per cent for three million Australians nationwide. Both these things help with the cost of degrees.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we win the next election, we will also reduce the amount of money you have to repay in your HECS debt every year. For someone on 70 grand a year, this means you will pay about $1,300 less a year than you currently have to. It means more money in your pocket, not the government's. It means more help with the cost of living.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have to do something about the cost of a lot of kids missing out on the chance to go to university at all. Today, almost one in two young people in their 20s and 30s has a uni degree—but not everywhere; not in regional Australia and not in the outer suburbs of our big cities. As a kid growing up in Western Sydney, I knew that for a lot of my mates university seemed too far away; it seemed like somewhere else for someone else. Part of fixing that is bringing university closer to where people live. That's what university study hubs do. We've already got more than 40 in regional Australia, and where they are they work. More people sign up for a degree and more people finish a degree.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, for the first time, we're going to put them in our outer suburbs. On the weekend I announced the locations of the first 10: Broadmeadows and Epping, in the northern suburbs of Melbourne; Melton, in the outer western suburbs of Melbourne; Macquarie Fields, in south-west Sydney; Kurri Kurri, just out of Newcastle; Elizabeth, north of Adelaide; Sorell, just outside Hobart; Armadale, Ellenbrook and Mandurah, in the outer suburbs of Perth; and Strathpine, just a couple of hundred metres up the road from the opposition leader's office in the outer suburbs of Brisbane. This is all about building a better and fairer education system and all about helping more kids from the outer suburbs and the regions to get a crack at university, and there's more to come.</span>

Given the cyclical nature of the cashflows of farming, can the minister explain, under the Albanese Labor government's changes to superannuation concessions: will a farmer who has their farm held in a self-managed superannuation fund have to pay tax on unrealised capital gains on that farm, and will that tax be payable when they have had a failed season with no income?</span>

As the member knows, the government is targeting tax breaks in superannuation to make them fairer, particularly for individuals with super balances of more than $3 million. All Australians will continue to receive their tax concessions to help them save for retirement. All superannuation funds, including self-managed funds, are required to have sufficient liquidity. That's already a principle and requirement of our current superannuation system. Under existing superannuation law, funds are required to have some liquid assets to meet any existing and prospective liabilities, cashflow requirements and expected tax concessions and consequences of their investments. Individuals can choose how they pay their tax, either out of their superannuation account or from their own pocket. This is similar to other parts of the superannuation system.</span>

Unfortunately, the Minister for Education dealt with alliteration earlier for his question! Labor is providing cost-of-living support for more Australians to access high-quality affordable training to help them get good, secure, well-paying jobs. Our free TAFE initiative is delivering the training Australians want and the skills that we need for them to get ahead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I was in Western Australia, and, on average, students there are saving over $2,700 for a cert I qualification or better with fee-free TAFE this year. I was at Bentley TAFE with the member for Swan. There I met Kayla, a single mum, one of the thousands of Australians benefiting from free TAFE. For Kayla, not having to find the money to cover course fees means she's got the opportunity to upskill. She's been working in kitchens most of her life, but now, with her kids in school, she wants to get a qualification towards a career she can do for the next 20 years. This is a really big deal. Kayla told us what she was telling her kids: 'I'm going to school to get a better job so we can have a better life.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was asked whether there is any opposition to this. Shockingly, there has been opposition. The Liberals continue to call fee-free TAFE wasteful spending. Under them, Australians like Kayla, working hard to create a better life for themselves and their families, would be worse off. The last time they were in government, we saw the damage that their disregard for the VET system had done. They left Australia with the worst skill shortage in 50 years. They ripped $3 billion from TAFE and training after a decade of reckless neglect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And we know that the Leader of the Opposition is a big risk because we know his record. He has opposed every single one of our cost-of-living measures, and, what's more, he has refused to back additional fee-free TAFE and VET places for construction—likewise, expanding access to new energy apprenticeships, expanding capacity for training facilities and the trainer workforce, support for women's careers in VET, and increased financial supports to priority apprentices and their employers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can't risk the Liberals limiting access to vocational education and cutting off pathways like free TAFE. Under them, Australians would be excluded from opportunities to upskill and make the contributions that we need, meaning the experience of older workers would be lost because they wouldn't have the chance to train for new careers, housing and energy projects wouldn't get the skilled workers they need, and business would be forced to look overseas for workers instead of employing Australians at home. The Leader of the Opposition's reckless arrogance has real costs for Australians. His agenda is wrong for Australia, and he's wrong for Australia too.</span>

Given that the Labor member for Fairfield, who should have a voice in government, has resorted to protesting against his own Labor government with placards and social media to secure a long-overdue upgrade for Carramar station in my electorate of Fowler, what commitment do you have to ensure our community in south-west Sydney receives its fair share of Commonwealth infrastructure investment, noting that the metro line through Fowler was cancelled by state and federal Labor?</span>

My colleague the infrastructure minister reminds me that we're investing an extra $2 billion in infrastructure in Western Sydney—an extra $2 billion of investment in infrastructure in Western Sydney. And that's because, if you look around at the members on this side of the House, from Western Sydney they come here and represent their communities with enthusiasm and with great success, making sure that in a budget which has some pretty serious fiscal constraints we still find room to invest billions of dollars in one of the most important communities in our country and one of most important parts of our national economy. And we will continue to make those kinds of investments in Western Sydney, whether people are waving placards around or not.</span>

The Albanese government understands the deep concerns of many parents about the harmful impacts of social media, including screen-time addiction, on their children, and they've told us that they want help managing their children's use of social media. It is why we are progressing this legislation. It is about helping families, when they are sitting around the kitchen table, to have the hard conversations about accessing social media. Our laws will enable parents to say no. The normative value is immense. But this is not about government telling parents how to parent; it's about getting kids back out in the playgrounds and on the sporting fields.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This aligns with what we're hearing from experts. We know there are benefits for young people from accessing social media, but we are also hearing about the hazards of excessive use. In 2022, a group of UK psychologists and neuroscientists analysed longitudinal data on 17,400 young people. They found that young girls experience a negative link between social media use and life satisfaction when they are 11 to 13 years old. For young boys, it is when they are 14 to 15 years old. This legislation will help relieve some of these pressures for young people—the fear of missing out, the infinite scrolling and the addictive features.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government appreciates the views that have been advanced by young people and mental health advocates. We know online environments can be an important avenue for young people to connect and to find their tribe, and we know the harms don't go away when someone turns 16. That's why, last week, I announced the Albanese government's intention to legislate a digital duty of care. It will place a legal obligation on the platforms to take proactive steps to protect their users. This is a landmark reform recommended by the independent review of the Online Safety Act. Our decision to legislate age limits for social media also builds on the changes I introduced to the Basic Online Safety Expectations in May this year. These changes mean that platforms are required to place the best interests of the child at the core of their services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the challenges of online harms are something that everyone in this House is concerned about. That is why we are looking forward to working with all members to deliver this critical legislation age limits to access social media.</span>

The government has made it clear that under this legislation there will be a broader definition of 'social media' to what is currently in the Online Safety Act. Defining an age restricted service is a new legal term, and we've been clear that the definition is likely to capture what is commonly understood to be social media. The framework will be clearly stepped out for the public and the parliament when it's introduced.</span>

Yesterday, along with the member for Solomon, I participated in the 14th US-Australia-Japan Trilateral Defence Ministers' Meeting, along with US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Japanese Minister for Defence Gen Nakatani. There is no country with whom we have more in common, with whom we have a greater strategic alignment, than Japan. That is why we have seen that our strategic and defence relationship with our old friend has developed rapidly over the past few years. Part of what we have in common is that for both of us our most important relationship is with the United States. We are both American allies in the Indo-Pacific.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, this gathering of the three countries was profoundly important for Australia. It is a gathering that is based on practical, real action. Secretary Austin's visit to Darwin was the highest-level visit of an American official since President Obama visited Darwin in 2011 to announce the Marine rotation. In 2018 Prime Minister Abe visited Darwin. But we understand that the visit of Minister Nakatani is actually the first visit of a Japanese defence minister to Darwin, which carries with it a poignancy. This was a historic gathering, and it was a gathering that was carried with weight. The outcomes of this were as significant as those of any of the previous trilaterals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday we announced that Japan will now make regular deployments of its Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade to Australia, with a particular focus of working not only with the Australian Army but also with US Marines as part of their rotation. Japan will also participate in Talisman Sabre 2025. This obviously builds the familiarity and interoperability between our respective defence forces and also sends such a powerful message about how our three countries are making a contribution to the collective security of the region in which we live, and we are asserting the rules based order within the Indo-Pacific.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also agreed that our three countries will commit to consulting with each other on regional security issues and contingencies. That means that our three countries will coordinate and cooperate on contingencies from conflict through to responding to natural disasters. Our three countries are the deepest of friends, and yesterday was an affirmation of our enduring commitment to each other.</span>

At the global climate summit the UK announced a 2035 emissions reduction target of 81 per cent, along with a ban on all new licences to mine coal. Despite promising Australia's target by February next year, the Prime Minister is now ducking and weaving on a pre-election climate target while approving 28 new coal and gas projects and lifting emissions higher than under Scott Morrison. Why won't you announce a new climate target that builds on the UK's ambition instead of opening new coal and gas projects?</span>

It contains an inaccuracy right at the centre of it, and that's the number of coal and gas projects he's pointed to. We have approved 10 times more renewable energy projects than coal projects. But going to the specific question about the 2035 target, can I reassure the member that the Climate Change Act that he voted for included within it a limitation that says the Climate Change Authority must provide advice before a 2035 target can be included. That was an amendment to the bill that was proposed by this side. It was an amendment proposed by the member for Warringah, and it was voted for by the Australian Greens political party.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That legislation that we passed enshrined both our national targets under the Paris Agreement and a process for determining the 2035 target. That process was voted for at the time by the Australian Greens political party. It was also welcomed by the member for Ryan, who said, at the time, 'We welcome the requirement that the Climate Change Authority once again advise on emissions targets.' The explanation for the member's question is that we're awaiting advice from the Climate Change Authority, which is considering the important issue of setting a 2035 target which will be both ambitious and achievable.</span>

We've introduced legislation into this House, and it is no exaggeration to say that, when passed, it will make Australia the hardest target anywhere in the world for criminal scammers to make a dollar. We will literally have the toughest scam prevention framework anywhere in the world. We will ensure that there is a significant uplift in prevention required right across the economy. It will be the toughest and hardest legislation anywhere in the world because it will apply to banks, to social media companies and to telecommunications companies. It will require them to prevent, detect, disrupt and respond to scams. It will provide victims with a pathway to compensation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm asked, 'What are the obstacles to this legislation passing and us keeping Australians' money and information safe?' Frankly, it's the indifference of the opposition—their indifference to this is a problem. We know that, under the Leader of the Opposition's watch, scam losses doubled every year since 2016. They doubled because the Leader of the Opposition was weak and soft on criminal scammers. He was weak and soft on criminal scammers. Australians were sitting ducks and, frankly, this is the approach that they are persisting with in opposition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm asked why I make that statement. This morning, when the leader of the National Party was presented with a very simple question—'Will you support Labor's legislation?'—he responded that they did not yet have a position on this. You're either on the side of the criminals or on the side of Australians and on the side of the Albanese Labor government, who is keeping Australians safe from these criminals. Under Labor, scam losses have reduced. They reduced by 13 per cent. We are the only country in the world that can make that claim. The clock is ticking. We can pass this legislation in this fortnight. Seven million dollars a day—that is how much Australians are losing. You can say in this parliament this week, 'I'll stand on the side of Australian consumers and I'll pass these laws,' or you can continue to be weak on the criminal scammers. You can't be strong in the telly and weak in parliament. Pass these laws. Back Australians.</span>

Recently, the RBA has said underlying inflation has eased further across advanced economies more so than Australia. Interest rates have fallen in the United States, Britain, New Zealand, Europe and Canada but not in Australia. Isn't the reckless spending of this weak and incompetent Albanese Labor government fuelling homegrown inflation?</span>

If the shadow Treasurer wants to make international comparisons, then let's make international comparisons. If Australia were to measure core inflation in the same way the US and the UK do, ours would be lower. If he wants to talk about movements in inflation around the world, he should be honest enough to say that inflation just went up in the US. It went up in Europe as well. If he wants to make international comparisons about inflation, he should fess up and say that our services inflation is lower than the UK and the US as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While he's at it, he can fess up and say that our inflation here peaked lower and later than the countries with which he compares us. While he's at it, he could concede for the House that interest rates are higher in the US, in the UK and in New Zealand. They're still higher than they are in Australia, and they went up by more. While he's at it, he could probably fess up to the House—while he's on a roll—that unemployment is higher in a number of the countries with which he compares us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the point that I would make again, for the very slow learner who was under heavy attack from his colleagues in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Saturday </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Paper</span> on the weekend for having no direction, no coherence and no idea—and this is what they mean by it; when his colleagues are bagging him in the paper, this is what they mean by it. Australians know that when this government came to office, inflation was more than double what it is now. When this government came to office real wages were falling; now they've been growing for four consecutive quarters. They know that when this government came to office there were deficits as far as the eye could see, and we turned two big Liberal deficits into two big Labor surpluses—something they were unable to do in almost a decade in office. We are under no illusions about the pressures that people are under, but we also say that any objective observer looking at the Australian economy would acknowledge the progress that Australians have made together since the hole that they were left in under those opposite when we came to office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I say to the shadow Treasurer: try and get a question at the business end of the pack if you can, and try and ask me a question. Every time he jumps up here and asks about these dishonest international comparisons, he leaves out the key facts. That is precisely why his colleagues behind him are speaking to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Saturday </span><span style="font-style:italic;">P</span><span style="font-style:italic;">aper</span> about a shadow Treasurer that only throws rocks, that doesn't have any direction, that doesn't have any coherence and that doesn't have any costed economic policies three years into the term.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a bit over two years we've made 250 or more new or expanded listings to the PBS, giving Australians access to some of the world's best treatment at affordable PBS prices. We've also listed new vaccines on the National Immunisation Program. Twelve months ago we introduced the most comprehensive protection program against shingles. Since then more than 1.6 million older Australians have received the new shingrix vaccine. Before then, they were paying $560 each. Now they get it for free, saving older Australians $900 million in just 12 months.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Sunday, as the member indicates, I announced another world-leading vaccination program, this time protecting little babies against RSV. RSV is the leading cause of hospitalisation for babies. An average winter will see around 12,000 babies put into hospital, a quarter of whom will spend time in the intensive care unit. But now pregnant mothers will have access to a new highly effective vaccine to take in their third trimester, which will give them protection but importantly give their newborn babies protection for several months in their new life. Usually, that would cost the family $300, but now it will be completely free. All states will also now provide a backup protection for families who haven't taken the vaccine before birth by giving them a treatment when the baby is born, in the first few days.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Catherine Hughes, who is the terrific founder and director of the Immunisation Foundation of Australia, joined me at the announcement of this program at the Women's and Children's Hospital in Adelaide where she said: 'This is a monumental milestone for preventative health and makes Australia a world leader in RSV protection.' This new program is going to cut the annual hospitalisation of babies due to RSV from the current 12,000, by more than 10,000. That's 10,000 families who will be relieved of the trauma, the stress and the anxiety of their precious newborn babies, usually only a few months old, who are hospitalised in their first few months—all while helping relieve the enormous pressure that we know our hardworking public hospitals have due to respiratory illness during winter.</span>

She simply raised a point of order asking the member to vouch for what he had said. That issue was resolved in a different way under your ruling at the time. The member can't now use a statement of personal explanation to try to revisit where he was not misrepresented in any way.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ANANDA-RAJAH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:22</span>):  on indulgence—When asked about what they're learning, the children at Ewing Kindergarten in Malvern East and the Windsor childcare centre cite caring for country. They appreciate the teachings from traditional owners of this land, as do I. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When elected in 2022, I knew that politics had a shelf life, but I didn't expect mine to be this short—well before my best-by date! The seat of Higgins, established in 1949, was flagged for abolition a mere two years into my term. It is named after Justice Henry Bournes Higgins, who became a peace activist after the loss of his only son in World War I, who raged against the authorities due to their dereliction of care following his son's death and who handed down the Harvester Judgement, which delivered the minimum wage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a man of principle, he fought for what matters. I took a page from his book, facing each day with urgency, focusing on the things that matter. I internalised the Prime Minister's 'never waste a day' adage, amplified by the departing member for Barton, who reflected that you can achieve more in one day of government than in years on the opposition benches. I can confidently say that I never took my time here for granted, using it to advance worthy ideas, often from my own community, and to advocate for better outcomes on behalf of the people of Higgins, who in turn advocate most strongly not for themselves but for others. They are a lion-hearted community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A seat steeped in history, producing two prime ministers, Holt and Gorton—four if you count Menzies and Fraser, who lived there—as well as Australia's longest serving Treasurer, this Liberal stronghold, for the first time in the seat's 75-year history, put its trust in Labor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That I was elected in a seat like Higgins repudiates the claim that people are sick of the major parties. Lifelong Liberals voted Labor. It was extraordinary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a child of this pandemic, I was indignant at a distant political class who gaslit frontline healthcare workers, ignored calls for better safety protections and did not step up when we were stepping into harm's way. Adding the deprioritisation of women, our embarrassment as a climate laggard and a casual approach to integrity by the former government and I was primed when the member for Macnamara and the Acting Prime Minister proposed this crazy idea. As Mandela said, it's only impossible until it's done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I chose to be in a party of government because I wanted to act on problems, not just complain about them, and I wanted to pull in a team.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Among my proudest achievements has been the elevation of clean indoor air both on the Labor Party's national platform and to the peak scientific body that advises the Prime Minister. With my partner in crime, the member for Cooper, who is unwell today, enabled by the Minister for Industry and Science and a recommendation from the long COVID inquiry, which I was part of, we persuaded the Chief Scientist to deliver an evidence synthesis of what works. Arguing the case for clean indoor air at the National Science and Technology Council and subsequently launching the report at a public webinar was a personal highlight for me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The community response has been overwhelming. Australians understand that we spend 90 per cent of our time indoors and that clean air reduces airborne threats like viruses, allergens and smoke. A community advocacy group supported by experts from the Australian Academy of Science and the Burnet Institute is launching this week in parliament to ensure that leaders don't drop the ball on this. It's not my pet project anymore. Implementation of indoor air quality standards will take time, but when 'productivity' is on everyone's lips, keeping people healthy is low-hanging fruit. Sick people are unproductive; it's as simple as that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are other issues I've advocated for which have made it past the budgetary post. A national one-stop clinical trials shop will cut red tape, providing Australians with timely access to life-saving drugs, and will help attract more pharma-sponsored clinical trials to Australia, which could be billions in economic activity. With hospitals groaning, research for the virtual clinic will help manage illness at home—better for patients and better for hospitals. Expanding the shingles vaccine to patients with weakened immune systems means that disseminated shingles—shingles that spreads all over your body—in the cancer and transplant patients I used to treat will vanish. The newly launched Genomics Australia will allow patients to access personalised treatments that they've read about online for years. Clinical guidelines for patients with chronic fatigue syndrome will be finally updated after 22 years, much to the relief and joy of 250,000 Australians with this condition—all thanks to the Minister for Health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Frontline community legal centres like Southside Justice and Eastern Community Legal Centre will have funding for youth and domestic violence services, thanks to the Attorney-General. The ill-advised Job-ready Graduates program will eventually be dismantled and public schools will get the highest funding ever, thanks to the Minister for Education. I've had a few wins with my state colleagues, but that's for another day. But it emphasises that this federation only works when Commonwealth and states work together. I established parliamentary friendship groups for men's health and electric vehicles, and I thank colleagues from right around the chamber and corporate sponsors, as well as community advocates for their engagement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Locally, I helped resolve a funding dispute between the National Institute of Circus Arts in Higgins and Swinburne University in collaboration with the Minister for the Arts. And finally, with the Standing Committee on Health, Aged Care and Sport, chaired by the endearing and much-loved member for Macarthur, I put long COVID on the radar, ending the testimonial injustice for these patients.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have held community events, walked the streets, stood on street corners, called up people, jumped on socials—which I do, under duress, due to my gen Z staff—all in the name of doing politics differently. I have tried to be proactive and approachable. One of the most gratifying experiences was striking up a conversation with a pensioner on a bench outside Malvern Central. He disclosed that he was renting and lived with his son. We got him Commonwealth rent assistance. It made his day and it made mine. It's a full bingo card.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Zooming out, I believe that the defining feature of this term has been overlapping crises from the pandemic, energy shock, regional wars and mass human displacement, punctuated by natural disasters due to climate change. Our term has been defined by a polycrisis, also known as a permacrisis—a state of permanent crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unleashing inflation and a cost-of-living crisis, we responded with support, not austerity, reducing inflation while keeping people in jobs. Going forward, keeping the inflation dragon subdued will demand continuous effort given that global and local shocks may well be the new normal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But inflation was not the only thing unleashed in this term. Social discord from antisemitism, doxxing and violence has threatened the lives and livelihoods of Australians and Labor parliamentarians and disrupted the wider community, fanned by the unforgivable weaponisation in here of a tragic conflict, for political gain. I repeatedly called this out and I hope that Australians at the next election call time on those political players who peddle division. Throwing manure on police will not expedite peace anywhere.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Australians, our allegiance is first to each other. Sectarian grievances should not be imported nor amplified here. Leave them at the door. That stuff is combustible. We need to learn to disagree agreeably, not with 32 characters in upper case but in a tone more akin to the letters to the editor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor recognises that our locus of control is here, not there but here. That's why we outlawed Nazi and terrorist symbols of hate, introduced antidoxxing laws, appointed a new Race Discrimination Commissioner—because racism is a barrier to belonging—conducted our first-ever multicultural framework review to pinpoint why multiculturalism is uneven and what we can do about it, funded intercultural activities and security measures, installed Australia's first-ever special envoys against antisemitism and Islamophobia, created a national student ombudsman with teeth so that university students feel heard and started imposing social media controls, given that social media has devolved from the town hall into a pogrom. This is our track record of real actions, not empty words.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is another threat to our social cohesion—a slow-moving one represented by communities exposed to fading industries. When economic deprivation sets in, social dysfunction follows. The UK community of Sunderland lost one in four jobs between 1979 and 1985 from the decline of its coal and shipbuilding industries. Fast forward 40 years, and the problems came home to roost this year when anti-immigrant rioting needed an army of police to quell. This cannot be Australia's fate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a coal and gas nation in a decarbonising world, we cannot be blind to economic realities. In that regard, Labor's Future Made in Australia is as much an economic policy as it is a social one. We aren't picking winners, but we have picked markets in areas where we have a competitive edge. These include low-emission technology, defence, agriculture, critical minerals, quantum and medical science and are backed by massive government investment, like the National Reconstruction Fund, to compensate for declining business investment. We want to give children in the Hunter and Higgins pathways into secure, well-paid, rewarding careers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am for AUKUS and for quantum—big bets that will have similar economic multiplier effects to what our car industry once had but on steroids. The tech and talent spillovers into our wider community and economy from a future made here cannot be underestimated. It will be evident as startups, patents, inventions, collaborations, jobs—a million flowers blooming provided that the seeds we have planted are not poisoned by the Achilles heel of politics: short-termism. We cannot keep surrendering the 8,500 PhDs we make every year to the hunger games of academia or, worse, to other countries. They need local industries, and we are pulling levers to make that happen. I'll cop the criticism if it means preventing the emergence of rust-belt towns in Australia. Labor can see the writing on the wall, and we are acting so that no-one is left behind. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Responding to the polycrisis means embedding resilience and redundancies right across the economy. In the way critical infrastructure like planes and bridges are overengineered, we need redundancies we can summon at a whim to tackle whatever is coming—terrorism, war, infectious outbreaks which may be natural or man made, cyberattacks, natural disasters or all of those at once. The most important countermeasure, of course, is our people—skilled up, paid a fair wage, pulled back from precarity so that they can be deployed like a trained army when the sirens ring.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of those armies is our Public Service. It is a national asset that Labor is building up again. Good luck to any government managing the new normal of multiple overlapping crises without a strong Public Service. I recall, at the start of my term, a constituent who in desperation paid someone to camp outside the Passport Office for two days. She was livid. The good news is that we have been on a recruitment drive because Australians rightfully expect decent public services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A skills uptake depends on access to decent education. To that end, we have championed education along the lifetime continuum. I never miss an opportunity to emphasise how foundational the early years are to leading a productive life. Better than thanking our early childhood educators, we are giving them a pay rise. However, undermining the efforts of our parents and teachers is an unwelcome house guest: social media. Excessive screen time is associated with myopia in kids, but of more concern is the myopia of the mind it is fostering, narrowing our horizons like tunnel vision, driving us into corners, fracking our attention and killing our negotiation skills. Unscrambling complex problems in the polycrisis era will not be possible if we end up with a generation unable to concentrate, unable to negotiate and unable to listen. Nor can we treat our way out of the mental health harm caused by algorithms targeting boys and girls. This is why we are imposing bans on social media and a duty of care. Social media is more about marketing now and less about connection.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Although education is the most powerful lever against disadvantage, it is not enough. For Australians to prosper, we are building out the scaffolding that helps them succeed, like housing, Medicare, child care and job security. Known as the social determinants, this scaffolding is bread and butter for Labor—bread and butter. Our target of 1.2 million homes in the next five years is ambitious, but so was the Renewable Energy Target set by a previous Labor government. Last week, incidentally, Australia clocked four million households with rooftop solar, thanks to a target set years ago. With people in tent cities and young people locked out of homeownership, we need this difficult Senate to pass our housing bills. Enough's enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my children, Annika and Ash: you make me look like an underachiever! Dad and I are so proud of the way you have grown despite my absences, often during formative events like VCE exams. I couldn't make snacks during those exams, but I did order Uber Eats, often from this chamber! This has been a character-building chapter, and you could both write the manual on resilience. My husband has been a rock for us all. I could only pursue politics thanks to what we built together. To my siblings, Romayne and Steve, who are here, and my parents: thank you for all your support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have deep gratitude to my staff. This is not a typical job, because we never switch off and the stakes are high. But you have served Higgins with professionalism, care and attention to detail. Thank you to my longstanding staff: Drew, Josh, Kalida, Brayden, Niamh, Gabi and Ro. Thank you to Llew and to my friends for your counsel and unwavering support. It helps to have a sounding board outside of this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am grateful for the many friendships across the aisle with colleagues from the Liberals, the Nationals and Independents—too many to name. We had some laughs while doing business. My community groups, parents and schools in Higgins: a profound thanks to you. Your volunteerism nurtures that which is best in us all. To my federal Labor colleagues, especially the class of 2022: we are a unit. The gender pay gap is at its lowest level ever because of a majority female government which is acutely tuned to the aspirations of Australia's women—aren't we?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm straying into dangerous territory now by singling out people, but I wish to thank the Chief Government Whip and the member for Hawke for their care and counsel. Labor delivered cultural diversity, which I hope continues into the 48th Parliament, because having people with funny surnames in this place helps shrink policy blind spots. We should be laser focused, not just on policy but on implementation, especially in health care. I had been reviewing a spate of migrant children—Australian children—dying in Australian emergency departments. But I have run out of runway. Colleagues across this parliament, I urge you to root out institutional bias in health care, because it kills. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When people look back, this government will be remembered for legacy reforms: tax cuts for all—not for some but for all—gutsy, but the right move. It will be remembered for the National Anti-Corruption Commission and for not one but two budget surpluses that allowed room for the things that matter, like paid parental leave, super on PPL, and the Housing Australia Future Fund. We've introduced electoral donation reform to stop elections from becoming auctions sold to the highest bidder. Supermarket scrutiny—aren't they enjoying that? There have been changes to competition, because it is the consumer's best friend, as well as a climate policy that won't deindustrialise our economy or see the lights go out and has upped renewable energy generation from 30 per cent to 42 per cent in less than three years. There has been student debt relief, free TAFE, Medicare urgent care clinics, Medicare mental health clinics, endometriosis clinics, a national anti-scam centre, a future made not there but here, a better NDIS, confidence in aged care, a nature repair market, tax cuts for EVs, and high-speed rail. Can we go faster on that? The Prime Minister is currently overseas repairing international relationships, because friendshoring in the polycrisis era also shores up supply chains and jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have shown that you don't conquer the future with press releases or personalities but with policies for today and tomorrow. Populist leaders and their perpetual grievance machines will seek to undermine our legacy, but they trade in a bogus simplicity, hocking simple solutions to complex problems that are hard to deliver in the cold light of day, leaving voters with buyer's remorse writ large.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I entered parliament because of people and purpose, only to find that politics is what gets in the way. But for all its imperfections, this place still gets things done. There is nothing like politics, as Gillard said, for delivering impact at speed and at scale. I've also learned that nothing is preordained. In the face of the polycrisis, the decisions we make today will determine whether or not we emerge with an inflationary hangover. Knowing that we are masters of our own destiny makes me not just an optimist but, as Desmond Tutu said, a prisoner of hope. I am seeing that hope baked into our work every day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the first Labor member for Higgins and its last ever member, I reflect that although it is not a utopia it is a strong community, where the environment is itself therapeutic: people living productive lives—close to jobs, close to opportunity, close to services—who are supported from the cradle to the grave. My friends and colleagues, places like Higgins should be the norm, not the exception, in this country. It has been an honour to serve this community and to serve in this Labor government. I thank the House.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs MARINO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:48</span>):  I began my first speech in this parliament by thanking the people in my electorate of Forrest for the faith and confidence they showed in electing me to represent them in the federal parliament. In this, my valedictory speech, I thank them most sincerely for that faith and confidence over six elections. It has been an honour and a privilege to serve you—the people of Forrest—during these years, and I've been absolutely grateful for every single day I've had here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I also thank my colleagues who are here in the chamber today? They are here in the same way that many of you supported my maiden speech 17 years ago as the 1,038th member of this House, out of only 1,244 in total now. I was part of the class of 2007, after the election where there were only seven Liberals—Rowan Ramsey, Luke Simpkins, Steve Irons, Scott Morrison, Alex Hawke, Stuart Robert and our one newly elected National Party member Mark Coulton. Even though the coalition lost that election, I can well remember the excitement we all shared. We have worked so well together; this speech is my opportunity to say thank you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly I thank those who have actively worked with me over the years to identify and help me secure what has actually been unprecedented federal investment in infrastructure projects and programs delivered into the south-west during my time as the member for Forrest. This includes the people in my electorate and my coalition colleagues during our nine years in government who understood and responded to the need for, and supported, this critical investment—investment that was so badly needed in what is one of the fastest-growing, most economically diverse dynamic and productive regional areas in Australia. With mining resource manufacturing, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, construction, tourism and retail, the south-west is its own economic powerhouse. It's also a region where people increasingly choose to live, to work, to raise a family, to invest and to retire.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal government investment has been critical to sustaining and the development of the region. It is often basic infrastructure funding—roads, bridges, the life-saving mobile phone towers, airport freight at Busselton airport, aged care and local government infrastructure—that can be taken for granted in metro areas. Let me tell you that those of us who live in the regions respect and value every single taxpayer dollar that is spent in our communities. We know that this infrastructure is critical and saves lives. It took over six years of work and persistence for me to secure what is now a billion dollars, 80 per cent of the value of the project, of funding for the Bunbury Outer Ring Road—thank you to my colleagues—and the dualling of the carriageway from Capel to Busselton.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My focus, though, for project delivery has been on local procurement in our south-west. I thank the unsung heroes I've met and worked with and for—like our local police, who I believe are at increasing risk every single day they're out on the road. A special thank you to our emergency services volunteers, our transport sector and our amazing truck drivers who are on the road delivering day and night; in my opinion, Australia runs on the back of a truck. The unsung heroes are also our farmers, who, day in and day out, supply us with some of the highest-quality fresh, locally and regionally produced homegrown food—some of the best in the world in our south-west. Our farmers need far less red, green and any other form of tape you want to talk about and less interference from activist groups. As Michael Partridge, a local dairy farmer in my electorate, said: 'I feed 50,000 people every year. How about you just say thank you and let me get on with it.' As a dairy farmer, I agree.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where water flows food grows, which is why our farmers need ongoing access to quality local irrigation and water supplies. Harvey Water, in my electorate, is a farmer owned cooperative supplying gravity fed irrigation water to its farmer members and fit-for-purpose water for industry through a series of pipes and channels. They are multi-award winning and great at their job, perhaps to the great frustration and disappointment of some who at the time didn't think our farmers were up for the job and openly said that Harvey Water would go broke and fail. Nearly 30 years on, Harvey Water and those very same farmers have proven them wrong. And, no, our farmers are not stupid; they are businesspeople in their own right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I must thank our community services volunteers and sporting club members, who, in our regional parts of Australia, are often the glue that hold our small regional communities together. These are the people I've loved meeting with and listening to—hardworking, selfless Australians, our volunteers, the ones who stand up when our communities are most at risk or in need. They are also the people I have great respect for because of their direct involvement in their communities and our communities. They know best what is needed and what will work in their own communities. To me, along with our current Australian Defence Force members and veterans, our volunteers represent the best of us, which is in part why regional Australia matters and regional people have earned and deserve respect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No-one should ever forget that it is regional Australia—its industries, its businesses and its people—that create the wealth that supports the basic services that Australians rely on every day. We should not be merely the dumping ground for endless kilometres of offshore wind and onshore wind, solar farms and transmission lines at the expense of prime food-producing land. We should also not be bearing the brunt of the closure of industries, such as live sheep or live cattle and our globally acknowledged best practice working hardwood forestry sectors. I wish every Australian could visit our south-west Wellington Discovery Forest to see how this most renewable, sustainable industry actually works. Being the member for Forrest, though, has given me the opportunity to provide the strong voice for these regional Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am so proud of those who live and work in the regions: the tradespeople, our tradies, who work in the businesses and industries that, as I said, create Australia's wealth—regions like the south-west of WA, where my history is and where I was brought up by my parents, both of whom died in 2000, before I entered the parliament. I know they would have been incredibly proud of my work; however, my mother would have been quietly worried sick at some of what I've had to deal with. By comparison, my dad was blunt in the extreme—it's where I get it from; apologies. He would have constantly reminded me, as he always did, since I was a kid—by your indulgence, Deputy Speaker, I would please insert a particular swear word here—to 'please just do the so-and-so job, will you?' That was Dad: 'Just do the so-and-so job. Get the job done.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My dad was a pioneer of earthmoving and cartage in the south-west. He was the only person I've known to have a licence to cut wood out of Kings Park in World War II, to keep the Princess Margaret Children's Hospital operating with steam. My mother fundraised and worked tirelessly to provide our tiny little home town of Brunswick Junction with its first and second ambulance. This was Brunswick's first ever emergency medical service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, when I was a kid our home phone was the ambulance phone. We had to be able to get an ambulance to the right place with the two drivers each time. Not only was she my mum and an ambulance volunteer but she also provided critical first aid in our house—knife through here, out there—and delivered a baby in the front seat of a car whenever needed. While Dad said to do the so-and-so job, Mum's instruction to us was, 'If a job is worth doing, it's worth doing well.' I thank them both for their values, their hard work ethic and their lifetimes of volunteering and working for our community. They were great role models and by their actions gave me a hands-on apprenticeship in what's needed in a small community: get involved, help out, get the job done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I often refer to my mother as the wind beneath my wings. And my father, who was a migrant, never forgot what he owed this great country for the opportunity it gave him—the opportunity to work hard, to save his money, to put a roof over his family's heads and to run his own small business. What a great country. Now, he was never going to be wealthy, but he was always going to enrich his own community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My husband and I bought our first dairy farm on the day we got married. He said, 'Don't marry me for my money, because it's all printed in red,' and he was right. Interest rates went from 17 to 23 per cent and, yes, it was tough, but we built a small business. I became very involved in the dairy industry, including in voluntary marketing and promotion with our milk industry group and with the Australian Dairy Corporation. Farming, water and regional issues followed, and as a community volunteer I spent 10 years—it was a fabulous 10 years—as the president of my local AFL footy club.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank my husband, Charlie, who encouraged me to take on this role and who, as you will all understand, never made me feel guilty for not being home. I thank him for the many years he did everything he could to make my job easier.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank my family. My son, Kim; daughter-in-law, Deanna; and their family took on all the dairy farming jobs over the past 17 years. I make special mention of my three much-loved grandchildren, Dylan, Simon and Sophie, who've grown up with a nonna—if you're Italian or of Italian descent, you'll understand what 'nonna' means—who has missed many of their special birthdays and events but who are great kids who never complained. I thank them for fitting in with my schedule for our family tradition of Italian sausage-making and sauce-making days. Now, they were very patient when people would stop for a chat when they were out with me in public, and, using my grandson's own words, they doubled up as my 'bodyguards' at certain times. I also thank them for what they've had to put up with because we share the same surname.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my precious daughter, Kylie, who is with us today, thank you for your love, support and strength, and for allowing me to tell the story of your very personal and dreadful endometriosis journey. This motivated me to work with my wonderful colleagues here to deliver the first-ever National Action Plan for Endometriosis, which brought ongoing investment and commitment for women suffering from this incurable lifetime disease. I spent 11 days in ICU with you, sweetheart. All I wanted was for you to live, and so far you have. I'm sorry your partner, Mark, is not here, but together you've catered for—and the Leader of the Opposition can vouch for this—so many dinners and functions at my home, along with our reliable and efficient offsider, Scott Chatley.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank my sister, Judy; my brother, Lindsay; and all my family and close friends who have been absolutely unwavering over these years in their love, support and patience. And I cannot forget my loyal Harvey Bulls Football Club crew. Jenni and Nirah Mattila—my dear friends, who live in Sydney—are here today. Every election they flew over to the South West to work on my toughest booths, because they were tough as well. Thank you both. I am so pleased you're here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the Liberal Party of Australia, and, in particular, our Forrest division branch members for their unwavering commitment and support, and for their practical help and support in manning booths. I also pay tribute to and remember past members who are no longer with us. I thank Dr Steve Thomas, who chaired each of my campaigns. Steve's straightforward, practical approach and advice was a major reason we won six elections, and we've done so much more together since.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A very sincere thanks to the late Senator Judith Adams. Judith showed me the ropes of doorknocking for half a day in Augusta and then said: 'You'll be right. Just get on with it.' Thank you to the colleagues who were there to mentor and support me in the early years: the wonderful Dr Mal Washer and Bronwyn Bishop. I learnt so much from them. They were tough. They were experienced. But they were generous MPs who were prepared to share their wisdom with me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank my fiercely loyal and hardworking electorate office team. Vicki Rake started as my campaign secretary and went on to work with me for 12 years in many different roles, including as whip's clerk in our Chief Government Whip's office team, along with Nathan Winn, whose knowledge of the history and workings of the parliament were, and are, invaluable. Julie O'Sullivan was wonderfully calm and extremely efficient in her role during what was a seriously challenging 45th Parliament that began with a one-seat majority.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The whip's team of Bert van Manen, Rowan Ramsey and our National Party whips worked so well together during this time. Thank you all, and thank you to all of the colleagues who worked so well with me during this time. Thank you very much.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I give a very special acknowledgment to all of my WA colleagues—we all worked so hard to deliver a fairer GST arrangement for Western Australia—and to Kerry Dawson; Jamie Martin; Robyn Roney; Samantha O'Connor; Dylan Gorski, and his carers; and the Newton Moore Education Support Centre students, and their carers, who have done work experience in my office over the years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate staff deserve thanks for all that you've done not just for me but for the countless constituents, businesses and community groups who you've helped over the years. They were often needing your care and compassion, and you gave it. Ongoing, we have Robyn, who's currently working with the service clubs to help auto-electrician Nathan Reed, who provides second-hand vehicles for women who are escaping domestic violence. Your ongoing work shows your compassion and we will make sure that that gets done by you. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you also to the electorate office staff who have moved on to other opportunities over the years. One of these is Ryan Hadji, who only heard yesterday that my valedictory was today. He flew all night just to be here. Ryan, thank you so much. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I cannot forget my Christmas mail-out volunteer envelope stuffers. You all understand the value of envelope stuffers. We've tallied it up today, and I think they've actually stuffed over one million envelopes in my time. A massive thank you to my assistant regional development ministerial team, who are here today, for their exceptional advice: Sophie Beeton, Sam Shirley, Rob Terrill and DLO Andrew Wilson. Thank you for your hard work and dedication, particularly in dealing with the challenges we faced during the COVID pandemic—the global pandemic—when we looked after the needs of Australia's most remote communities in Christmas Island, Cocos Keeling Islands and Norfolk Island. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I must also thank the 53 Regional Development Australia committees, who dialled in to me at my kitchen table at home, three times a week, to provide live, invaluable and accurate information about what was happening on the ground in each of their regions during the pandemic. From these meetings, we developed a regional intelligence bulletin which was passed on to every ministry—the various ministries necessary—to directly assist in the government's COVID response. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud of what we all achieved together and with our key departmental staff. My teams know that they are just like family to me and, like my family, they are worth their weight in gold. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you to all our truly amazing parliamentary staff—the chamber staff, committee and support staff, security, Comcar drivers, gardeners, maintenance workers, cleaners, hospitality and catering, as well as our baristas who work on the coffee carts—I see many of you using those. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I must thank the AFP, who work so hard to keep us safe. Their constant, protective security deserves our respect. In my opinion, they're legends: those here, in and around Parliament House, and our WA based AFP, who looked after me with great care during a risky situation. I really appreciate everything you do for us, domestically, and for Australia around the world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another person I need to thank is Julian Krieg. During his time as WA's regional financial counselling service chair, whenever one of the men had the courage to ring me when they were in desperate personal circumstances, Julian was my emergency go-to for practical help. On one occasion alone, he drove all night to get to a man I was particularly concerned about. To Julian's great credit, each one of those men he helped has gone on with their lives—the best result we could have hoped for in the circumstances. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally, many other wheat-belt families and men, supported through the Regional Men's Health Initiative, who have relied on Julian and his team over many years, have made sound decisions about their family and/or their business future. I thank you, Julian, if you're watching, for the lives you've saved. This is more proof that every day we have in this House as a member really matters and makes a difference. It shows what a difference we can make. I love the work I've done with palliative care and in childhood dementia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In part, when I was elected, I was actually old enough—as you can see—to know that tomorrow is guaranteed to no-one, which is why we need to make the most of every day in life and in politics not only because we owe it to our constituents but also because each day we serve in this parliament is actually one day less we will get to serve in this parliament, particularly when you're in government. Please don't ever kid yourself—and this is the old whip coming out now—no matter what your margin is, there is absolutely no job security in politics. Your own side can take you out, or the other side can take you out or the media can—or all three! So don't ever forget what it takes to get here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've kept my very ugly but comfortable first campaign doorknocking shoes. I kept them right where I can see them every day when I get dressed, a reminder of what it took to get here and to never waste a day. Now, as Vicki knows, there was blood in those shoes. It was a very hot lead-up to the 2007 election, and in those days I had a 21,000 square kilometre electorate to get around, along with a range of major towns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like many of us in certain areas, I got used to being told where to go in very graphic terms. I admit at times I did get to the point of saying: 'I'm actually looking for directions. Could you please tell me where to go, nicely?' And, yes, I was chased by rottweilers, but the only dog that bit me was a jack russell. It's not even a great war story!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, on the first day after I was elected, I sat down and thought about what I wanted on my last day as the member for Forrest. What I wanted was the respect of good people who knew what I was trying to achieve and who knew that my heart was in it. I wanted to maintain my integrity in what is rightly a tough political world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That original class of 2007 became my great mates. We learnt a lot together. A number of us, along with our regional colleagues, have worked year in and year out on every regional and rural issue, such as higher education and youth allowance access issues for regional kids. We've been at it for years, and we brought together 30 of our colleagues as we worked through this. We've also worked on the critical importance and needs of small businesses in regional areas. Small businesses are often the lifeblood of small regional communities, and they employ the majority of the private sector workforce. In our communities, small businesses often give young people their first ever job and, for older people, often their last job. With several of my colleagues, I've worked closely with the dynamic small business minister Bruce Billson to deliver many sound small business policies and initiatives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Early on in my time as an MP, I was a member of a communications committee which did a report into cybersafety and young people. I realised then, from the survey we did of young people, just what they were dealing with online and how much risk they were exposed to. I quietly developed a set of overheads, and I was encouraged by the Harvey business and professional women's group to offer it to our local primary school. And that was the start. As most of you in this chamber know, I have delivered hundreds—well over 400—of these cybersafety sessions to schoolchildren from preprimary through to high school, very quietly and very carefully. The sessions are aimed at helping them to stay safe online and to know how and where to get help. Mostly, though, these sessions are aimed at encouraging families to be involved from the first day the first device is given to their child.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of schools in my electorate have asked me to come in each year or when they had a particular problem caused by online behaviour or the constantly evolving risks with certain games, apps and sites. I want to thank these schools and the parents who've come along to these sessions. Over the years a number of teachers have quietly said to me, 'You have saved lives today.' I knew it mattered and I knew it worked. The mum of an 11-year-old girl, after I had been into their school, rang my office and said: 'My daughter has just come home. She has listened to what you've said and the way you explained it. She was being groomed online now, today.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am possibly the first Liberal Party member to have been appointed whip on day one in the parliament. I think it might be true. And, yes, it was a very steep learning curve, but the wise and capable Alex Somlyay was an invaluable mentor. Much of what I learnt from Alex stood me in great stead when I was appointed as the first female chief government whip in Australia's history. It wasn't just the practical and parliamentary organisational side of this role that was so important; a major part was to provide feedback from the backbench to the Prime Minister and to give him frank and fearless advice, even if he may not have always wanted to hear it. There is a great deal of trust involved in this role. I have always maintained and will always maintain the confidences of the Prime Minister, my ministers and members of parliament and staff members who have chosen to come to me. And, no, I will never write a book about those confidences or disclose those or this information to anyone—not one person.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my colleagues, I don't need to tell you that national security, the defence of this nation, is the government's No. 1 priority. The coalition has always prioritised national security. All my life, this has been a priority for me, well before being elected. My family lived through World War II, and my mother was a World War II widow. Her husband was killed in Papua New Guinea in 1943. My sisters never knew their father, and my family has lived with this loss all our lives. So not only do I know, directly, what it takes to defend Australia—the sacrifices made by my mum's husband Jack Leonard and the over 103,000 brave and dedicated members of our Defence Force who have lost their lives to protect our freedoms—but I also directly understand the sacrifice made by their families, like my mother's and my sisters', which was why I became involved with the Defence Force Parliamentary Program as soon as I came into this place. I acknowledge, today, Major Daniel Tidd, who's here with the reciprocal ADF program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I took part in as many of these programs as I could. I wanted to meet and listen to our people on the ground, wherever they were deployed. I wanted to hear from them exactly what they were dealing with and whether they had the right equipment and support to do what was needed wherever they were deployed to. One early ADF program had a very profound effect to me. It was the trip to Afghanistan in 2011, which ended in the week leading to the taking out of bin Laden, where I was on the ground with the troops. Prior to that time, I knew we'd problems with the CV joints on the LAVs, and we'd lost one of our first combat engineers in an IED explosion. I wanted to hear directly from his mates what had happened, and I did. It was something I will never forget, and every one of these Defence programs that I've done has reinforced to me what great Australians our ADF members are. And I was given a very direct lesson in how respected our ADF is overseas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many years ago, on a delegation, I laid a wreath at Tyne Cot Cemetery in Belgium to honour the memory of the over 1,369 Australians buried there. I followed that up with a visit to Polygon Wood Cemetery. At Ypres, I met the oldest Menin Gate bugler, and I thanked him for the huge commitment he and his volunteers made by playing 'The Last Post' every evening. That was over 30,000 times, at that point. He looked at me very seriously and he said: 'You listen to me. At the time, the Germans were determined to destroy our nation and our people. All we are and all we have is because of your Australians' blood on our soil. The least we can do is play your "The Last Post".'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all understand how serious the Pacific, regional and global security risk is. On home soil, I've been absolutely devastated by the rise in antisemitism that has been allowed to flourish in Australia. My one surviving sister, Judy, whose dad was killed in World War II defending Australia and its values, said to me, 'This is not the Australia my dad fought and died for.' She is right. It is the duty of each one of us in this place to fight for and ensure that our democracy, freedoms and rights are preserved and protected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have great faith in the common sense and genuine goodness of the Australian people. So to every young Australian: You live in the best country in the world. What you can and will achieve is not limited by your postcode. Be proud of Australia, and be prepared to work for and fight for this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my coalition colleagues: as a farmer, a small business owner and a regional Australian, I say that we have never needed a coalition government more than we do right now. I've been farming for over 50 years, and I've never been as worried. And it's a genuine worry, as my colleagues know well. To the Leader of the Opposition, Peter Dutton and our team, including Ben Small, the Liberal candidate for Forrest: all strength to your arms. Make the most of every day, do everything you can to win the election, but never forget the real forgotten people every day, or what makes us Liberals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have had some wonderful relationships and friendships on both sides of this House, and I value them dearly. Please all stay safe and well, and look after your loved ones. And a final thankyou to the people of Forrest. I've been grateful for every day you've given me.</span>

The five small schools that you visited in my electorate were very grateful. It was a two-way conversation. I'm really pleased that you're now much more aware of the finer points of catching wild pigs, and the roles that the dogs do and the various parts of the pig's anatomy that they grab hold of! </span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">COULTON:</span>  I don't believe it's because of my behaviour. This is as close as I've ever sat to the Speaker in 17 years. You'd have to have a Speaker with ears like an African elephant to actually hear any interjection from this far back. So, except for the two years I was Deputy Speaker and happened to sit in that chair, it's been fairly uneventful in here for me, apart from misleading the House as a minister during question time. That's a very interesting thing to do! That walk from down there up to the dispatch box, not knowing what you're going to say when you leave down there is a feeling all of its own. And, on my second day as Deputy Speaker, having a motion of no confidence in the chair is also something that I will remember fondly!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is, next week, 17 years since I was elected. It's appropriate that the member for Forrest and the member for Grey are doing these speeches today—three farmers from different parts of the country. The member for Grey's my next-door neighbour. We've got about a 500-kilometre boundary fence between South Australia and New South Wales. Indeed, I've got one of my offices on South Australian time. So we have a lot in common.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to acknowledge that I've got some very special people in the gallery. I'd like to acknowledge my family. I've got my sister Joy and her husband, Jim; and my much older brother, John, and his wife, Kerry. My brother Bob is sitting up in the back row. Two years ago Bob was in the intensive care ward at John Hunter Hospital after being within seconds of death from a very, very severe farm accident, so we're really pleased that Bob's with us. There is someone missing, though—our older sister, Viv. When I got involved in politics, she took to it like a duck to water. She was my strongest supporter in Moree, Gravesend and Warialda, and God help anyone that was critical of the National Party or me, because Viv would track them down, and she took no prisoners. Sadly, we lost Viv to cancer about seven years ago, and her husband, John, lost his long battle with dementia earlier this year. So they've left a big hole in our family, and I wanted to acknowledge them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my children, Claire, Sally and Matt: you were young adults just starting out in life when I was elected 17 years ago. Matt's now got Anna with him, and, our youngest grandson, Sandy, is sitting up there—there he is—and Claire's son Will, who's managed to wag school today, and Sally's daughter Charlotte, who's just about finished her first year at school. Their husbands, Dan and Bob, had to stay home and look after the other grandchildren and keep the home fires burning. I could speak about the accomplishments of my children, but today's all about me! I wouldn't have enough time to mention—just to say that I'm incredibly proud of the lives that you've built for yourselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've got in capital letters 'Robyn'. I do not want to forget Robyn! He's not here today, but for some reason I can remember the member for Moreton's speech 17 years ago. I was going to sledge him, but he's not here, so I can't really do that. But he said, 'Behind every successful man is a very surprised woman.' I remembered that. But it's not really relevant in our case because Robyn's never been behind me; she's always been beside me. I like to coordinate events in our relationship with celebrations, so it kills two birds with one stone. I believe today could be the 44th anniversary of our fifth date, which involved Robyn riding around the header while I was harvesting wheat. Mind you, that level of attention didn't last that long, but, 44 years ago, it was pretty exciting to have a pretty young schoolteacher riding around the paddock with you. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But Robyn has been with me—we had fairly separate lives. She was a schoolteacher most of her working life. And so we decided to do this as a team. So for the last 18 years—we spent a year campaigning beforehand—we've travelled together, and in a big year we've probably spent the equivalent of 20 40-hour weeks in the front of a car, Robyn reading the emails and me dictating messages back to the office. With an electorate the size that I've got, you don't have a budget to have staff with you all the time; you just cannot do that. So we've travelled, and we've done that. She's had very sage advice and no issues as to when I've said the wrong or silly thing, because it gets pointed out! Robyn is very well regarded in the Parkes electorate, and, quite frankly, many people would be quite pleased if she was the member. Mind you, things would be a bit tougher if she was!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's only been one incident where we've had a complaint to the Electoral Commission. Peter Bartley is up there; he received that because he was my campaign manager. Robyn and a senior adviser, who's sitting over in the adviser's box and shall remain nameless, were manning the pre-poll at Cobar, and they got involved in a ruckus with a hippie that had got off the bus from Wilcannia. They forget the basic law of politics: you should never argue with a fool. Anyone that argued with Robyn and that unnamed adviser clearly was a fool because they came off second best. That's the only blemish in her 17-year record.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But also, for a long time, pretty well the whole time the coalition was in government, Robyn was the chair of Parliamentary Partners and Teresa Ramsey was the secretary. They ran that very important organisation for a lot of years and provided support to the partners of all political persuasions for that time. Indeed, a very exuberant reporter once said the Parliamentary Partners was the most powerful organisation in Canberra; I wouldn't be one to disagree with that!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge my staff, past and present. There are a lot of them here; a lot of them have travelled over lots of distances, and there are too many to name. They are the true heroes in this. They are the true servants of the people. The reason I've been able to do this job for so long is that with everyone that rang either my electorate office or, when I was a minister, my ministerial office, their issue was treated as the most important issue my staff were dealing with at that time. They gave exemplary service. We've had a lot of people that have come through, and many of them have gone on to other careers and other occupations. I'm incredibly grateful to all of you that have come back, and to my current staff as well, for the job you've done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had a big incident in Dubbo some years ago where a suspicious package happened to turn up. It was seeping. One thing led to another, and the Hazmat team was called and the centre of Dubbo was locked off for a couple of hours—only to find it was two bottles of organic prune juice. The constituent was coming to complain about Australia Post, and things got a bit out of hand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to acknowledge my National Party supporters and friends who have come from a long way; some have got off headers to come down here. It's a very effective political organisation. I think we've got nearly a thousand members. They're not zealots; they are just good people who want to be involved in the representation of their area. It's not a room of parties. One of my executive in the Parkes electorate has a lineage going back 60,000 years, and another one is a Bangladeshi migrant that's been in Dubbo for 10 years. They come from all occupations and all towns across the electorate. The Parkes electorate council reflects the people we represent. They mightn't realise it—the general public don't think about these things—but they should be very grateful for the work that these people do in the background, not seeking any public acclaim for the work they do. I think I joined the party 28 years ago, and I think I haven't missed either a Gwydir or a Parkes FEC meeting in that time. I'm grateful because these people from across a big area have become my friends. And I'm very grateful that they're here today. And there's not one beneficial billionaire amongst them. If we did have a beneficial billionaire that wanted to join the Parkes FEC, they'd be welcome! But mostly it's just good, hardworking people that are doing their bit for democracy in their area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to acknowledge my party room and the opportunity that it has given me. For the second time I'm the Chief Nationals Whip. What a lot of people don't know about being the Nationals whip is that one word of command from me and everyone does as they please! But a lot of people don't understand why we have political parties. It's the division of labour. I'll talk about the coalition in a minute because I am a strong coalitionist, but we've got people that have different backgrounds and different skillsets. The job is too big for one person. You need to rely on your colleagues to actually do some of the work so you're best prepared. Our party room—I've seen it at the best—was only 13 members when I was elected. There was a report written suggesting that we should just fold up the kit, disappear and become members of the Liberal Party. I'm glad we didn't. We have a role for a group of people who only focus on regional Australia. I know we've got regional Libs, but we're different in the fact that that's all we are concerned about. And so I thank the Nats party room for their support and I wish them well. I've served under four leaders, and those leaders in different ways have given me different opportunities to work at a different level.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition party room—I couldn't believe the first time I sat in there with the people that I'd only ever seen on TV. As a new member, you've got to very quickly say: 'Hang on a minute. I'm not here as an observer. The people that put me here don't want me to come here goggle-eyed and watch on.' As quickly as you can, you've got to know your way around so you can effectively represent those people.' Because of the 'Rudd-slide' when we came in, I ended up being in the shadow ministry before I got sworn in. I was a fairly lowly rank. For those in the gallery, in shearing shed terms, I was the tarboy in the shadow ministry, but it did give me an insight in the early days and a great opportunity. So I am very proud. I believe in the coalition and I'm proud to have served in it for this time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also a parliamentarian and I believe that, if you want to have a say in this country, you get yourself elected and you sit in here or with our Senate mates over there—and I acknowledge my Senate colleagues behind me. There's no truth in the rumour that I said my retirement plan was to sit in the Senate for two terms! That's being a bit facetious, because the Senate plays a valuable role, and I appreciate very much the work that it does. But, if you want to be running this country, you sit in here, not up there. A degree in communications at a university does not give you the right to run this country. You've got to sit in here. You've got to use this seat. I'm proud to be in this place. Not many people have got to do it, and I'm pleased that I have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My constituents in Parkes—half of New South Wales. It's an economy underpinned with agriculture and mining, and that's very important. We are seeing probably one of the biggest grain harvests in the history of the electorate being harvested at the moment. There are massive crops out in Western New South Wales, averaging six tonnes to the hectare—unheard of a few years ago. Largely because of the techniques, the efficiency and the professionalism of the farmers, we're now growing crops in places like Walgett, Coonamble and out west of Moree.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also the miners. We've got coal. We've got silver, lead, zinc, copper and massive reserves of gold but also the new minerals: the cobalt, the lithium, the magnetite, the scandium and the rare earths that will be dug near Dubbo. All these minerals that people are talking about with our new economy, our technology, are in the Parkes electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's more than miners and farmers; it is all the people who serve those industries. I get very frustrated when we talk about a health crisis in the west. Sure, we need more doctors, we need more nurses and we need more aged-care workers, but don't forget the ones who are out there. You can get good service. Those people—our teachers, all of those people—are out there doing their bit. I say to my staff: 'Our job is to represent the people who aren't thinking about us, who are just going about their daily work.' If I'm doing my job, I'm not on the front page of the paper. You should be largely invisible if you're doing your job properly, because people then are settled. Sometimes your successes with issues become invisible, because if you fix the problem people stop talking about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And so to innovation. A lot of people wouldn't realise that you could be in one of the top hospitals in Europe or America getting a heart valve inserted, not through open heart surgery but through an artery in your leg, and that biomedical device started its life in a lab in Dubbo. The coalition government put money into developing that lab. Biomedical pieces that are saving lives all over the world are coming out of Dubbo.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's been a lot of talk during the last term of parliament about our Aboriginal people. I believe I represent the second-highest Aboriginal population, by percentage, in an electorate of this parliament, after Lingiari. As to the way the Voice in Canberra has been portrayed—and I don't want to be too negative—I just want to remind people that at the last local government election in the Parkes electorate we got a mayor, a deputy mayor, a general manager. Most of the councils that have Indigenous populations have Aboriginal councillors on them. You go to our schools and we've got teachers and we've got healthcare workers. We've even got a young bloke from Goodooga who, at 18, went to New Zealand and beat the Kiwis at shearing. The Aboriginal constituents in the Parkes electorate are just people. Sure, we've got some disadvantage, but your DNA doesn't predict your disadvantage. We should be addressing disadvantage at the individual level, not making assumptions about an entire cohort of people from here. I'm not being a pollyanna; we do have some issues at the moment and we need to address these issues of disadvantage. But we need to deal with them at an individual level.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my first speech here I mentioned education. The Clontarf Foundation is in my electorate, and I was actually one of the first people to be involved with Clontarf. I think we've got 11 or 12 academies, maybe 13. In that time there would be more than a thousand young Aboriginal boys who have finished school and gone on to employment. We've got girls academies. We've got SistaSpeak. I was at the senior college graduation in Dubbo a couple of weeks ago. Seventy-seven of the graduating class were Aboriginal students doing year 12. So when we talk here about some of the things that go on, we mustn't forget about our successes, because these young people are really cracking on. I'm incredibly proud of what they've done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The temptation in this job is to point to shiny things as to your worth. That's a pretty good thing to do, but my job wasn't to go home on weekends with beads and blankets and curry favour with my constituents. I think it's deeper than that. But there are some examples of shiny things that I'm very proud of. The Western Cancer Centre in Dubbo now is world class. It has the only PET scanner west of the range in New South Wales. It's treating people who formerly would not have taken treatment. They would have chosen to die rather than go through the trauma of going to a capital city. They're now getting that treatment in Dubbo, and we've had medical professionals come from all over the country to work there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Inland Rail—just build it, for God's sake. I'll say this one more time: the Inland Rail is not a train; the Inland Rail is a railway line of 1,700 kilometres from Melbourne to Brisbane. It will give cheaper freight. It will make items on the shelves in those two cities cheaper for those people to buy. It will take trucks off the road. It will lower emissions. But it will mean that western New South Wales through to the Parkes electorate will have the benefit of being connected to every capital city in Australia and of the opportunities not only for our grain farmers and our cotton farmers but also for other businesses to be established on rail. History shows us that, wherever rail is built, prosperity follows. We had a report by Kerry Schott last year. It did not say to halt construction. If I'm not here next time and I don't see a bit of action, I'm going to park at Aussie's every sitting day and harass whoever's in charge of infrastructure, okay?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Opal Centre—it's a big hole at Lightning Ridge that's going to have this magnificent building that's being constructed now. The Baaka Cultural Centre at Wilcannia—I chaired the first meeting of what can be quite disparate groups in that town, and they decided that this was going to be a game changer. So, instead of a burnt-out old shop when you cross over the Darling River now, there will be the Baaka Cultural Centre, a magnificent building. It will be open by Christmas time. There's the libhrary in Broken Hill—and even smaller ones. I see the former mayor of Gunnedah and the best damn candidate for the next election, Jamie Chaffey, sitting up there. Don't worry folks; he has been doorknocking for eight weeks, and he's allowed to come down here today! We had a road, the Grain Valley Way—it was dangerous, there was a lot of production on it; the school bus and all that. The local government, the federal government, the state government—it's fixed. No-one talks about it now because it's a good road.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We talk about pork barrelling in the bush—$10 million to the Bourke council to help with the infrastructure for a small animals abattoir. It's now owned by Thomas Foods. Now, there are 150 people working in that abattoir in a town that had shocking unemployment levels. Not only that; it has brought more workers in. The people that have come with those workers have now opened businesses. There's not an empty shop in the main street of Bourke, because of that. Now tell me if that's not a good investment by the Australian people into a disadvantaged community. They're the shiny things—some of the ones I can point to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, on some of the things I'm probably most proud of, I just want to premise this by saying I did this as part of a team. We had wonderful ministerial staff. We had public servants. We had our party room and we had backbench committees. Everyone worked towards these things. But a lot of the things that are achieved here are done without recognition. If you're only seeking recognition, it's not going to go particularly well. The generalist pathway, which is training doctors with more skills to work in rural areas—general practice is still languishing with the number of young doctors wanting to go into it. The generalist pathway, on which I worked with ACRRM and RACGP—we significantly increased the numbers with the rural health commissioner of the time, Associate Professor Ruth Stewart—is now oversubscribed. The medical school at Dubbo had over 520 applicants for the 30 places, so we're training local doctors in the area. People don't talk about that now, but it's just happening. The single-employer model, for which I set up five trial sites, where we are getting a better cooperation between the federal government and the state government with funding medical practitioners in small regional areas, has now been taken up by New South Wales as a broader policy. We did the trial work on that. We transitioned the training of doctors from the RTOs to the colleges, ACCRM and RACGP. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With these longer term ones, it's difficult. When someone comes to you and says, 'We haven't got a doctor in town,' and you say, 'Don't worry; it's under control, and, in 10 years time, it's all sorted,' that's not the answer people want to hear. But, in an attempt to fix that in the short term, we've made bigger problems. We're now paying doctors who go to work in a town part time as a locum twice the salary of a doctor that wants to go there and hang up their shingle and work full time. So we've created a bigger problem. We're seeing that now in aged care, where we've got agency nurses getting paid more than the local nurses to fill the gaps in aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Decisions that are made here make a difference. When the distribution priority area changed straight after the last election—where doctors can now declare Wollongong, Geelong and Newcastle to be regional—western New South Wales lost six doctors from some of the most disadvantaged communities in the country in that week. So decisions here can make a difference. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I graduated the rebate for Medicare. I don't know that anybody here even knows that if you're a doctor working in the higher MM areas you get a higher rebate for every patient you see than the ones in the cities. Frankly, when the current government increased Medicare, that increased exponentially, and it has made a huge difference. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Trade—that was an amazing thing to do. And I see my trade adviser sitting up there. I was involved in, I think, six rounds of the RCEP, Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, negotiations in the ASEAN region, forming a trade relationship with our emerging nations to the north. I represented the country a couple of times at APEC on tourism and trade. I was at the first ministerial meeting of the TPP-11, which was the biggest trade deal done in the history of the world. I was fortunate. I don't know where the trade minister was. Clearly, it was fortuitous that I got sent there. But what people wouldn't realise, when the farmers are going to the silo and looking at the price of barley, is that one of the buyers now is Mexico. They're buying barley to make beer in Mexico because of that agreement that we made. They're not thinking about that. When they're having their big crop now and they're filling up the grain storages that they got off their tax in one year, as a policy to prepare farmers for drought so that they can store their grain and manage it better, they're probably not thinking that that was a decision and a discussion that came out of our party room—or a backbench committee in the first place. But those sorts of decisions are making big changes for people. So going to Tokyo and signing that agreement in a room chaired by Shinzo Abe was a pretty good thing to do for a bloke that had stepped off a tractor to come to parliament. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Local government—I was previously a mayor. With my colleague in front of me, the member for Riverina, when he was infrastructure minister, using the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure fund and local government—527 local governments across the country—to deliver that money into those communities during the pandemic quickly, without bureaucracy, was a masterstroke. We should keep doing that. This government has stopped it. I think we did six rounds of LRCI. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted to reform federal assistance grants. I was not so successful there, mainly because of the reluctance of some of the larger regional local governments. But, thankfully, the grants commission in Queensland took that on, and now those smaller councils in western Queensland are getting a much fairer cut of the pie because of that change. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was minister for regional communications for a while. The Regional Tech Hub is now helping people with this transition. Communications is no longer a static thing. You can no longer sit at home and expect that the government is going to supply all of your needs. You need to be out there and understanding that it's evolving. Our need for data and communications in the regions is growing exponentially. It's actually growing faster than the way to deliver it. We are seeing innovations. On the low-orbiting satellites, I once said rather flippantly that in 10 years time our Telstra towers will just be used at Christmas time to put lights on, because that's evolving. You can drive around Australia now with a thing on your roof and get connectivity in every square inch of the country. That's all changing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to leave with maybe a little bit of a message. I think we've lost our way. As a country we've been very successful, but I think that sometimes we've forgotten some of the basics. When we were in school we learnt the three basic needs of human beings: food, clothing and shelter. I spoke, in my first speech 17 years ago, of my concern that we had lost the ability with the shelter bit, because we'd lost the timber industry out of the Pilliga forest—incidentally it now burns nearly every summer since it's stopped being managed. But the food and clothing bit is important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the day I turned up here, emissions reduction has been the undercurrent. It has seen prime ministers come and go, and it has seen governments come and go. I've been called a denier across the chamber; I'm not. But we talk about 2035 and 2050—what about 2100? What about 2200 and 2500? We've got to remember what developed this country. Our forebears cleared land to grow crops. They went out and found mineral resources and developed them, at considerable effort and expense, and we seem to be taking that for granted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So when you take your family to Disneyland and tick the box that you want to offset your carbon emissions and pay a bit more money, and that money goes to plant trees on a productive farm, you are then sending a future generation to have to worry about food security. And if you want to put solar panels all over farmland it's the same thing. My electorate was adopting solar before anyone was talking about it. Three-quarters of the houses in Dubbo have got it on their roof. Every farmer in my electorate would be pumping water with a solar array and shearing their sheep with solar, but they don't want to see the whole of the countryside covered up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got some environmental champions in this place. I do get into trouble sometimes, but I once did say to a certain member of a certain minor political party—that might sit over there—that my dung beetles had actually done more for the environment than he had. And it's true. These words have consequences, and if we're going to treat regional Australia as a magic pudding, that every time we want to do something we just pink a bit away, and every time you lock up a western New South Wales sheep farm and turn it into a national park or you buy productive water out of the Murray Darling Basin, then you are subjecting future generations to have to worry about food security. And it's not just us. We feed 50 million people outside of Australia, so we've got to keep that in mind. We need to have a more holistic, broader approach to what our future generations need—not this narrow approach at the moment of trying to meet targets on emissions, because it will be a problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that I've noticed is we're making our children fearful of their future. Every generation of mankind, humankind, has had issues. Quite frankly I don't think the issues that we're facing today compare to what our forebears did when they dealt with the Depression or the world wars, or even before that. Encouraging our kids to superglue themselves to a railway line is not going to create the future for this country. We need to be telling them that this country will offer them all the opportunities—they need to work hard, they need to study hard, they need to apply themselves, and they can do whatever they want. We shouldn't be making them fearful about their future. And I've seen speech, after speech, after speech in this place that have done nothing but scare the life out of our young people, and it's got to stop.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I said in my first speech that I have a deep and unshakeable belief in inland Australia; I still believe that today. It holds the keys to the future prosperity of our country. There would be no better place to live in the world than Australia, and no better place in Australia to live than in western New South Wales. It's been an honour and a privilege to serve as the 1,029th member—I beat Nola by a few—elected to the Australian parliament. But it's time to move on, and I thank you very much.</span>

                  <a href="HWS" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAMSEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:02</span>):  on indulgence—I must say, coming fourth in the line after some very fine valedictories, I feel a bit like I'm the last speaker in the session after lunch and I'm stopping people from going to drinks!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Seventeen years—you wouldn't believe it would go so quickly, quite frankly. It's more than a blink. It's more like a hard day's work out in the paddock, quite frankly; it's tough enough while you're there but it's over quite quickly. It doesn't seem it was 17 years ago that I got here. I must admit, I went to a meeting this morning and got out on the wrong floor; I started off 17 years ago like that! I am reminded, in that sense, of the way life rolls on. A good friend of mine, Josie, said one day, 'Life is like a toilet roll; the closer you get to the end, the faster it goes.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I love this job. I'm not tired of it, and I'm fit enough to keep going. It seems like I've got a growing task sheet; there are as many things on my desk at the moment as there's ever been. And I think, arguably, I'm the best in-form person in Australia in the seat of Grey. So why not keep going? The answer is, quite frankly, as I told my party room back in March, increasingly our friends are falling into three groups: those that are touring either Australia or the world, or towing a caravan around Australia; those are trying to die; and those that have been successful in the attempt. Teresa and I have collectively decided we're going to spend a bit of time in the former group before we get to the latter, and smell the roses along the way—even though, I must admit, Teresa is facing some trepidation at the idea of having me home full time. But we'll get along with that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This job is never complete in rural and regional Australia. We still have an education gap. We struggle to attract teachers, health workers, aged-care workers and professionals. We have childcare deserts; in fact, Grey is listed as having one of the worst childcare deserts in Australia, and that is holding back communities in my electorate. When you try and get somebody to come, to recruit them to come and work in your business in one of the small towns, the first thing they say is, 'Where do I put my kids in child care?' The government's spent a lot of extra money on child care recently, but we're not getting any new places in regional Australia. We need that to change. Those of us that do live and work in and who were born and raised in regional Australia are a bit bewildered by the fact that so few people want to come and share this lifestyle, as the member for Parkes said. There will be a number of things he had to say that I'll cut across to. It's pretty good out there. For anyone that's got skills, you might be interested to come and live and work in the seat of Grey, and I just say: 'Go for it. You won't regret it.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of that is that Australia doesn't connect as well with its traditional roots—its rural roots, its regional roots. And a lot of that is because, when we were younger, almost everyone in the city knew someone who lived in the country—an uncle or aunty who lived on the farm or a grandma and grandpa. They'd go up in the school holidays. But, increasingly, that's become a rarity more than the norm, and so there are whole swathes of the population now that are basically intimidated by the thought of going into the country for anything more than a short visit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been a privilege to be a member of the federal parliament. I don't think any of us should ever forget what a privilege it is or forget who put us here. And I note, in that sense, the Liberal Party's gone through the process of preselecting someone to run in my place at the next election. I'm very hopeful that he'll be successful, and, to Tom Venning up there—it's his first visit to the parliament, so welcome, Tom. I hope, when you come back, you won't be sitting here; you'll be on the other side of the House. A very enjoyable experience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been 17 years, and there have been some very significant achievements in my electorate in that time, and one would hope, for that kind of timeframe, there would be. On some, I've been the prime mover. On other, I've lent my support to the ideas and the dreams to assist the passions of others. It's how we get things done—working together in our communities for the common good. And I think members of parliament have a unique megaphone. Many times, we can actually use that public megaphone to get somebody in the Public Service to do what they should have been doing in the first place or to draw attention to an opportunity or a miscarriage of justice. But I think that megaphone is best used if it's not overused and if you actually pick your targets in where you can make a difference and throw your shoulders to the wheel on those. Equally, there is so much to do, because we need more of those skilled professionals that I touched on before.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have plenty of critics on the work we do in this place. Someone should come out for a bit of a stroll some time. There are not as many as who would drive you out of it, but there are plenty of people that have a fairly low opinion of politics generally. And I just say to them: 'Okay. I can see that not everything we do in this place is perfect, but where do you think they do it better? Just start pointing to those dots on the map around the world where they have a better democracy and where they have better outcomes,' and, generally speaking, I find them speechless. I do offer in there, if you can find the place, I'll see if I can set up a permanent visa for you. But there is no doubt in my mind that, if you're born in Australia, you have won the lottery of life. We are so lucky. We're the envy of the world in many cases. In most surveys, we're in the top half-dozen economies of the world and the highest incomes. We have the fourth longest uninterrupted democracy in the world. That's a pretty amazing thing for a nation whose Constitution is 123 years old. It just shows you how unstable the world can be—that we are the fourth longest. We have world-class services, generally speaking. They're all under pressure, and we all know that we could all do better in certain areas, but don't undersell what we have here. By comparison with many other nations, this is a very enviable place to live.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On that theme—once again, the member for Parkes touched on it—Donald Horne is the often misquoted author who wrote the book <span style="font-style:italic;">The Lucky Country</span>, but what he was saying was that Australia was lucky, but we're in danger of squandering our luck, and that our luck would run out. I actually think I'm more worried about that today than I would have been in 1963 when he wrote the book, because we seem to be loading the dice against Australia and Australia's industries at the moment and disadvantaging ourselves in comparison with other nations around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've just come back from leading a delegation to Morocco, joined by some very good parliamentarians, including the member for Adelaide over there—thanks, Steve. And the dynamism of the place—their ability to get something done in a short timeframe—just leaves you wondering whether they're 50 years behind or 50 years in front of us, quite frankly. They've set up a free trade agreement with Europe, and Renault have built this enormous car plant there and are shipping the cars straight back in. They have economic tax-free zones—all these things. They are an innovative country on the move, and I think maybe we need to reflect on how they got to that place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our falling per capita productivity is a great concern, as are drifting education standards. We know that our schools are not keeping up with our neighbours', in our own neighbourhood. There are stifling regulations and ever-expanding responsibilities of employers to pick up the bill of national objectives—for example, domestic violence leave. And it's not a bad policy—it's a perfectly admirable thing to do, the right thing to do—but how on earth did it end up being the employer's responsibility rather than the responsibility of general society, of the taxpayer? That's the kind of thing we pop onto employers all the time, such as when a government in South Australia suddenly decides to declare Easter Sunday a holiday and the pay goes from time and a half to double time and a half for people who are trying to run a cafe. It wasn't theirs to give away! They are giving away the money of private individuals and businesses, and I think we always need to be mindful of that in a place like this, where we make decisions about what those impacts are on the ground.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Australians, we're always seeking increasing standards. The nursing home, the level of health care, the style of holiday and the number of appliances that our parents accepted aren't good enough for us. But it all costs money, and we expect this great country to foot the bill. So, those aged-care facilities that are too small for us and don't have the connected bathroom and all those kinds of things, but that all costs money. I think there's a fair argument that we are actually not contributing enough to our nation to make it successful, to pay for all the things that we are demanding as a population. I think that's something we could all reflect on—how we do a better job for our nation. A very famous president of the US talked about what we could do for our nation rather than the other way around. I think we are reaching that point. So, while people will make claims now to work a four-day week, for instance, or they don't want to come into work at all, thank you very much, or they want to have more holidays, I think we need to reflect on that level of productivity and what on earth is going to pay for all these extra things that we want in our lives. There's a money-go-round effect here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More and more Australians are involved in the service industries—and good on them; I'm not saying that's a bad thing to do. But, on the other hand, service industries do not create new wealth for this nation; primary producers do. In the very broad term of when I went to school, primary producers were people who actually farmed or produced something from scratch, like a miner or a manufacturer. Increasingly there are fewer in that cohort and more in the area of service delivery. That's all very well as long as the country can pay for it, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to do so, and I think we need to reflect on that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The electorate of Grey has achieved much over the last six parliaments. The member for Parkes talked about big shiny things, and I'm very pleased to report that we have a twin bridge in Port Augusta called the Joy Baluch AM Bridge—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-GeneralIInterjecting">An honourable member interjecting</span>—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr RAMSEY:</span>
                  </a>  the second one. I had to walk three transport ministers over that bridge—another one down here I think!—to actually nail it. And it is the right kind of investment, because the north of South Australia, the regions, is where the mineral wealth is. In fact, every major mine in South Australia is in the electorate of Grey, which covers a mere 92.4 per cent of the state. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is the Port Wakefield overpass and the dual lanes we have commenced on the Augusta Highway, which is now only going to go as far as Lochiel and not keep going all the way to Port Augusta, which I had hoped. That's reprioritisation with the current government, but we should keep going on those things. The upgrades to the Horrocks Highway, Eyre, Augusta—the whole lot of them—have had major upgrades, and there is the sealing of the Strzelecki Track. I don't know how many have been up the Strez—once again, the member for Gippsland has been up the Strez with me. In fact, we had a photo in front of the sign that spelt Strzelecki wrong! That's been fixed up, I can tell you. That road will become one of the great tourist routes of Australia, connecting Queensland through the outback and bringing you down into South Australia, into the Flinders Ranges if you turn left—or you can go right and go up to Lake Eyre. It's not a bad little option, really. And, of course, the mighty Moomba basin sits right in the middle of it. That was a god outcome. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there are the tens of millions of dollars that have gone into BBRF programs, sports and community facilities, town sewerage systems, marine facilities, historical precinct preservation, bike trails, tourism—it goes on and on. They're are all good projects. There is the Mobile Black Spot Program and an enormous expansion in coverage. Is it complete? No. It will never be complaint. Perhaps that was touched on again with Starlink; you can't get behind every rock with a radio frequency. But it's certainly made a big difference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another thing I've been involved with is how Defence has a penchant for going out and compulsorily acquiring properties. We've had a fair bit of it go in the electorate of Grey. I've been sticking up for the landholders' rights, which I think are treated terribly in this situation. I've got people I helped out who had 25 years to reach settlement. I've got others now that are approaching the 15-year mark on the compulsory acquisition around Cultana. I'm pleased to be involved with these good people. I'm a bit concerned now that it's all done that the Army is going to abandon Cultana anyhow. It's been a difficult time for those things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The establishment of four headspace units across Grey is a great thing. I wanted another one in Port Pirie and haven't been able to get it, but just a couple of weeks ago we opened a Medicare mental health facility there, and I'm indebted to the former minister Greg Hunt, who put those on the line to fill that space. As for those four headspace units, we've got one in Port Lincoln, one in Whyalla, one in Port Augusta and another one in with the Royal Flying Doctor Service. They are doing great things reaching out to our young people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And there is the dog fence. Where are you, David Littleproud? There he is. The dog fence is a 120-year-old fence that snakes across outback South Australia, protecting sheep farmers from wild dogs and dingoes. We were struggling to get this one up at the South Australian level, and we managed to get David Littleproud to come open the Jamestown show. His staff said, 'We've got a couple of hours free in the morning; have you got anything you could do?' and I said, 'Yes, I've got a really good idea.' So I got a hold of the people at the dog fence and they came in for a meeting. We were about 10 minutes into the meeting and, to his great credit, David said, 'Yes, I've got it. I understand what you're saying, and we're going to make this happen.' And we did with a $5 million contribution from the federal government, $5 million from the state government and $5 million from growers. What I got out of it was an increase in my levy! But the fence is now about two-thirds complete and making a real difference across the outback. They are really good wins. There are the regional airports. I don't think there is a remote airstrip in a remote community that is not sealed for the Royal Flying Doctor Service to get in, and that has been the remote area airport subsidy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here in the House, we all belong to all kinds of committees and different organisations. There are a couple I'm going to mention here. Unfortunately, the member for Moreton is not here today, but the enemies of diabetes is an organisation we had to rename. I didn't really want to be a 'friend' of diabetes, so we renamed it the 'enemies'. Graham Perrett's been the co-chair with me for the last nine years of these three parliaments. We're both leaving, and I wish him well in his retirement from federal parliament as well. We are very alike, Graham and I, in personality, I think—like the two moons of Mars, as it were. But when it comes to opinions on things political, we're more like other things celestial—Venus and Mars—I think. There's a fair way between us. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was another committee that I worked on. I was chair of the agriculture committee. I went to Ian Macfarlane at the time—I can do a reasonable job of imitating Ian, but I won't do it here in the chamber—and I said, 'I want an inquiry into country-of-origin food labelling.' He said, 'Why would you worry? It's been done to death. There's been about eight inquiries before.' And I said, 'Yes, I know that.' And he said, 'Well, you're not going to get anywhere.' So I said, 'Look, all of those inquiries—I've looked at the reports—say that the government should do something about it. We should have a country-of-origin food-labelling system. You give me a go at this and we'll tell you how to do it. How about that?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we got permission. It went ahead. We had to get permission from Barnaby Joyce as well. And then we delivered the report. Some circumstances happened and we managed to get it implemented. So when you go down to the supermarket now and you pick up the food and you see the bar graph on it and it tells you how much of that content is Australian, that came from my committee. I wrote the report, basically, but with the support of the rest of the committee. That's just what you can do when you actually dig in there and find the answer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the time of the inquiry, I said, 'There are a whole lot of people in Australia who need to push that shopping trolley down the supermarket and fill it up with the cheapest food they can to feed their family, and they shouldn't feel bad about that. I say, "Good on them." But there is a whole lot of people in Australia just like me who have a high enough income to make a choice about whether they want to support Australian manufacturing or whether they want to support Australian growers, but they can't do it if they haven't got the information, and now they have.' I'm pleased that that will now spread on to fish, but at the time I knew that was a bridge too far. It would have got too complicated and bogged down. So we made the move, and that was a good outcome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's an old adage that holds true: you cannot please all the people all the time. We know that's true, but I say to electors that they should elect an individual to this place whom they trust to make an intelligent decision on their behalf when that individual is in possession of the facts. You may not always agree with the conclusion that the elected person comes to, but you should elect someone you trust to make an intelligent decision. It is better summed up, I think, by Edmund Burke, the Irish philosopher-politician of the late 1700s, who said, and excuse the sexist language; it is of its time:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">My reading of that is that we should not be in this place to slavishly follow the latest poll. We shouldn't be driven by those ways of making decisions. We should be here to provide our judgement and to lead our communities through challenging decisions. There are two obvious areas where I'd claim to have done so, and these areas have delivered success—I must say, sadly, only to have it reversed by the current government at the change of government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first is Ceduna and the cashless debit card. Out there we'd had, I think, seven deaths. We'd had a coroner's report into people sleeping rough and into drug and alcohol abuse. It was really a very tragic story, and one thing led to another. We'd had a number of interim outcomes, and then Twiggy Forrest suggested to a joint party room one day that we pursue a cashless debit card and, with the great support of the local community in Ceduna, we led the nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank Allan Suter, mayor at the time, and also the Far West Aboriginal Communities Leaders Group, which was established at the time. It took some real guts and determination for them to withstand local pressure, as you would imagine, to back the card in. Once again, I think Mr Chester was with me when we were at a meeting and there was this old pastor. I thought the meeting was going a bit rough—we had a few public servants in there—and then he stood up and we all listened to what he had to say. He cleared his throat and he said, 'I reckon we ought to do it. I think it'd be a good thing,' and we knew we were over the line. And it was a good thing. It made such a difference. There are people who sit around—they've taken surveys or whatever—and say, 'Oh, it's inconclusive.' I can tell you it's as clear as night and day. In fact, of the two of the mayors who led the community through that time, one has sold his house and is leaving community and the other one is leaving in the next 12 months, because they can't bear to see what's happening to their town.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I'm pleased that our leader, Peter Dutton, has said we will be bringing back the cashless debit card. It does not take income away from people; it just says you can't spend it on drugs, alcohol and gambling. Three things—that's all it prohibits. Everything else you can buy. It made a difference to rates of domestic and public violence and to admissions to emergency care. The rates at the moment are far higher than they were when the card was in action. School attendance has fallen too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other place where I would claim to have led the community was in my home town of Kimba, where I raised the possibility of and led the push to establish a national radioactive waste management facility. I'd had an opportunity courtesy of one of the round-the-world trips that once were available to parliamentary members who'd served more than one term. You could go around the world once in pursuing your study topic. We'd had a big desalination plant planned for the Upper Spencer Gulf, and I was very interested in the environmental impacts of what that might look like. Of course, I've still got one of the world 's biggest uranium mines—it's a by-product of its being a copper mine—in the electorate, at Olympic Dam, or Roxby Downs. I had the possibility of going to Europe, and the French, the Swedes and the Finns showed us a wonderful time and took us through their facilities. We looked at the uranium fuel site from top to bottom, including disposal. When the opportunity came up for a low-level waste repository, I really thought this was money for jam. It just needed somebody to recognise what it was. But how could I ask somebody else to nominate their property when I was sitting on my own piece of land and could nominate my own? That's exactly what I did. In the end, I was rubbed out by protocol, it would be fair to say, but by then others in the community had offered their properties. Some of them are in the chamber today, and I'll come to them in a little while.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Kimba we went through a survey and then two full plebiscites. In every one, support for the facility grew, to the point where we reached 62.2 per cent. For the record, that was about the same as for same-sex marriage, which was an overwhelming, landslide result, if I remember rightly. So it's worth putting that in context. Then we managed to get it through both houses of parliament. There had been claims from an Indigenous group. The Barngarla Determination Aboriginal Corporation twice had their case thrown out of the Federal Court. They went back for a third attempt and, on a story whose basis stretches belief—and I've spoken about it in this chamber before—it was halted by the Federal Court. The Federal Court left the door wide open for an appeal, but, in the shadows of the approaching Voice referendum, the current government abandoned ship, and there's still no solution for Australia's storage of low-level waste. Something like one-in-three families benefit from nuclear medicine. It's a weak decision by the government. I'm sorry to do that in this kind of address, but really I'm very sad about it. I'm very grateful to those families that stuck their hand up in the local community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To go on with this theme, it's instructive that the Voice referendum was rejected in a landslide, 60-40. It was actually closer to 80-20 in my electorate. Rightly, Australia rejected the notion of two classes of citizen. I think we've taken a backward step as a result of the Voice referendum, and part of the reason it was rejected, I think, is that native title has become an extortion racket. Projects have been halted or delayed at the penultimate moment by a claim of significant religious or cultural interpretation. Rampant conservationists are edging in and misusing native title groups. I have absolutely no doubt about this. It's an unholy alliance. By doing so they are eroding Indigenous people's standing in the general community. The intolerance to this in the general community is rising.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It all started with Hindmarsh Island, a case back in the 1990s where there was fabricated evidence. More lately we have seen the refusal of the Blayney goldmine and the Santos Barossa pipeline project. Again in Grey, there was a small desalination project at Port Lincoln. It had some community resistance, but the South Australian government, not worried about that community resistance at all, were quite happy to go ahead with it, but then of course, when the Indigenous owners—well, they're not owners, because this is freehold property. Once again, it was the Barngarla people who put in an objection, and it all seems to have fallen over. When the community objected, that was okay. When the Barngarla people objected, it became a stopper. Australians don't see this as fair and reasonable treatment, and that's why I actually decry the fact it's causing more problems than it's fixing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've allocated a large amount of time in my 17 years in politics to try and better understand the issues and opportunities of Indigenous Australia, particularly remote communities. Eight per cent of my electorate identify as Indigenous, and around 40 per cent of those live in remote communities. For the ones that are living in the bigger communities, things aren't perfect, but we are absolutely making progress. The member for Parkes touched on this. I'm seeing success stories—people in jobs, getting their kids to school, driving good cars, living in good houses, living a good life, enjoying the Australian dream. But I can tell you in remote communities we're not there, and we're not there by a long way. I fear we're actually going backwards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think I've gained a lot of respect in those remote communities simply because I go there regularly, and I'm prepared to sit down not only with the leaders but with anyone I find outside the shop or in the village square. We sit down in the dust and talk about what it is they want and what they'd like to see changed and what drives the place. I think I get respect for going there. I absolutely claim that I have their best interests at heart, and I've delivered investment on many levels—and friendships.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The billions of dollars we're spending in these remote communities, delivering improvements in schools, health clinics, shops, roads, dialysis units, communications—it's all very evident. But, I have to say, despite all that investment, improvements to their actual outcomes are hard to identify. The gap is not closing. The education system is failing. The reason it fails is because kids aren't at school. No teacher can teach children who don't attend school. Here's the sad news for them as they grow up: if you can't read a label or the safety directions, in this modern world, there isn't a job for you. It's virtually impossible. So we've got to break this cycle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Remote communities are totally dependent on taxpayer dollars for their existence, and we should be able to have a grown-up conversation, not just here but with them everywhere, about the wisdom of a policy that maintains and grows a population in a part of Australia where there is not a genuine economic possibility of underwriting that existence. Men, particularly, have been totally stripped of their role in society. The men's roles were to deliver shelter and food, to find water, to defend their family. Now all that comes from the government. They go down to the shop. One of the biggest sales on the APY Lands, for instance, is frozen kangaroo tails. It tells you about that disconnect from their traditional lifestyle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I give a speech on this recently in the Federation Chamber, and the member for Clark was in the chair. I'm sure he won't mind me sort of quoting him. I don't want to get it wrong, but he came up to me afterwards and said: 'I've never heard anyone explain it to me like that before. Clearly, you're not speaking from ignorance; you are speaking from experience.' I don't know if that will change his attitudes on anything, but he was generous enough to grant me that concession—that it was heart felt and that it came from experience. Enough on that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll get to the thankyous. Serving in this place is a privilege, and that electorates put their trust in individuals like me and like all my friends sitting around me at the moment is an honour within itself and is a wonderful thing. I've had wonderful opportunities to travel at least some of the world—I just spoke about Morocco before—to meet national and local leaders and the best and brightest people with plans and ideas to improve the nation. That's a privilege. I've laid wreaths on delegation at Hellfire Pass and Brunei Bay in Brunei. I've been to Menin Gate twice for the evening service which has been carrying on since about 1926, I think.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have walked Kokoda in a private capacity and attended an Anzac Day Dawn Service at Gallipoli. On that occasion, I'd only attached myself to the delegation at the eleventh hour. It was a freezing cold day. We were sitting at Lone Pine, and I heard them say: 'On behalf of the Australian government, Mr Snowdon will lay a wreath, and, on behalf of the Senate, someone else will lay a wreath, and, on behalf of this, someone will lay a wreath. On behalf of the House of Representatives'—I thought, 'I wonder who they'll get to do that.' Then they said, 'Mr Ramsay.' I thought, 'Right!' I'm rugged up; I've got my gloves on, got the scarf on, got the coat on, and off it's all coming, as fast as I could go. I got there in my suit, so I didn't look too bad, went up and laid the wreath. That's quite a special moment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It even got better because my sister who's in the gallery at the moment said: 'You wouldn't believe what I saw when I turned on the news after Anzac Day. The first thing that came on the ABC was my brother going down to put a wreath up at Lone Pine.' There you go. After all the best laid out plans for everyone else that wanted to get on the ABC that night, it was down to the member for Grey!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">They are wonderful experiences, but I think perhaps the greatest reward for this job is actually when you fix up personal problems. From the outside, I don't think you rate it, but, people come to you when the system has chewed them up, spat them out and not taken any notice of what they've had to say or it's just—everyone's seen <span style="font-style:italic;">Little Britain</span>—'computer says no.' You can do anything you like up until the computer says no. My staff and I put our shoulders to the wheel and achieve an outcome that should have happened in the very first place, but you just know that you made such a complete difference to their life. It is a privilege.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What getting ready for a political life doesn't prepare you for is that you become a counsellor. People will tell you the best and the worst of their lives, and I think both of them are a privilege. People share some of their darkest moments with you and don't necessarily want you to fix it but to instead just listen. That you can be that person is a very rare and pretty privileged position.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've come to thank some of the people who have given me an opportunity, but, before I get there, once again it was the member for Parkes who touched on the Rudd-slide. We were bright eyed and bushy tailed—the six new Liberals and the one new National that arrived here in 2007. Of that group of six Liberals, four have already left—actually I must have that a bit wrong because my maths doesn't add up. Three are delivering valedictories today, and there's still going to be one left. Something doesn't work quite right there, but anyway. We walked into the party room on the first morning, and, of course, there was a lot of licking of wounds going on after the years of the Howard government. We'd lost government. There were six new Liberals there who thought it was a wonderful thing—they'd just elected us—but everyone else was a bit down. The redoubtable Senator Bill Heffernan said, 'The reason we lost this election was all the deadhead candidates we had.' We all looked at each other and said, 'He must be talking about us.' We became the deadheads. For some years, we used to meet as the deadheads and get people with political experience to come in and speak to us. And, I think in fine form, we decided to appoint Bill Heffernan as the patron saint of the deadheads, and we used to have an award called the Billy for the person who had caused the most problems to the government that week or the week that we met in. It was a good time. Including Scott Morrison, after this next election, we'll be down to just Alex Hawke, who I can't see here at the moment. He will have to carry on without us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just on the three valedictories today—the three from this side of the chamber—I must say it is very fitting that we give them together. We came in together and we're going out together. Nola, from day one, a pocket rocket or—and I know you won't mind me saying this—a pint-sized milking maid! But don't get on the wrong side of Nola. She was determined for her electorate every time, and I am a great admirer—and she's a great friend, and we will remain friends. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Mark Coulton: we have so much in common, Mark. We're both life members of Apex. We're both farmers. As farmers, we both understood that if you wanted to droughtproof your farm you had to marry schoolteachers! They are sitting together behind me at the moment, Robyn and Teresa. Together they piloted the parliamentary partners association for six years, and I think that is a very important organisation. If we could get more of the partners to come more often to Canberra and share in their partner's experience, we might be able to keep them together on a bit more of a regular basis, rather than having so many of them split up. I think anything that brings you closer together through those times is a very good and important thing, and I thank them both for that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the electors of Grey—six times they've seen fit to appoint me to represent them: thank you so much. I don't say that lightly. To the more than 400 members of the Grey Liberal Party who journeyed up to a 1,000-kilometre round trip back in 2006 to preselect me: thank you so much. And they've just gone through that process again. If I'd never been the Liberal candidate for Grey, I would never have had the opportunity to be the member for Grey. To the 800 people who make up the membership of the 22 Liberal Party branches across Grey: thank you for your work each and every election, keeping the flame alive in the community—because we all believe in the same things, even those we have differences with across the chamber. We all believe in a better Australia. A lot of us just believe in a different pathway to get there. I'm absolutely thankful for their support. To my home town of Kimba and my lifelong friends who have supported me—some of them that are here today, some of the most important; not all of them—certainly, through that period of the radioactive waste management facility. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm just the third member for Grey from the Liberal Party. The seat of Grey was formed in 1903, and I'm only the third Liberal. In fact, from 1943 to 1993, we held it just once. That's 50 years. We held it for one term in the 1966 parliament, when it was won by a fellow called Don Jessop, who later had a career in the Senate. In 1993 Barry Wakelin won the seat for the Liberal Party, and I succeeded him. Now we've held this seat for the last 31 years. Barry is from exactly the same home town as myself, Kimber. I think that's quite a remarkable outcome. So, for 31 years, my small community on the northern edge of the Wheatbelt has provided the member for Grey. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a community of just over a thousand people. I think we punch above our weight right around South Australia. The current chair of the South Australian local government association is the Kimber mayor, Dean Johnson. And, with Caroline Schaefer and her father, Arthur Whyte, Kimber has contributed a member of parliament at either state or federal level for 40 of the last 48 years, and for 17 of those years we had one at state level and one at federal level. I think that's quite remarkable. It's something about living on the edge. It's not easy making a living in Kimber, and I think it's always attuned the people of the town to what the exterior threats are and why we need to have a common purpose when we come together as a community and work for those outcomes. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the great joys of the job is the plethora of new friends we've made right around the electorate, people that we would have never, ever met in another life. Obviously, there are too many to mention. But a special call-out today for Anthea Kennett up there in the pink—thank you, Anthea—who's come here from Wallaroo today. She and her husband, John, committed no greater sin than being our friends when we took our kids to boarding school together. I managed to recruit them into the Liberal Party and rebuild the local branch there. They weren't on their own, I must say, but thank you for making the effort of being here today, Anthea.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The team from Kimba, Jo and John Schaefer, Jeff and Jenny Baldock, Graeme and Heather Baldock—Heather was my first campaign manager—are still here with me, 17 years later, backing their local boy. I thank them so much. They are just such wonderful, valuable friends. There's another couple who couldn't be here: Bert and Barb Woolford. Barb is a ball of energy and will throw her shoulder to the wheel on any attempt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, one of the things you need to do is try and get some people up on the APY Lands when you're having an election. Barb was often at the forefront of leading a delegation or being part of a delegation to go and hand out for Rowan Ramsey. One particular afternoon, she and my wife, Teresa, were there—I think they were at Mimili—and there was a fair kind of raucous going on about 50 metres away from the voting station, as sometimes happens in these communities. Just when they thought things might really get out of hand, this big bloke walked in, in traditional dress, with a spear. He went over and, in no uncertain terms, told them they should disperse and get about their lives, which is pretty much what they did. Then he headed towards the voting box with his big spear. Barb and Teresa thought, 'Oh, gee, what do we do when he gets over here?' Teresa said, 'Hold your nerve.' He came up and put his spear down on the ground and then—as he should—he took a 'How to vote for Rowan Ramsey' card and went in and executed his democratic right. Barb's has been a very special contribution. One year, someone from the Electoral Commission got sick and they only did half the booths, so she headed back up and did the second week. I always say, incidentally, that to get to the Lands it's a thousand kilometres without going out of my electorate, from my gate to the turn-off, and then, if you want to go to the WA border, it's another eight hours. I try and do that a couple of times a year.</span>

And thank you to Deb Darby, who came down ill and couldn't make it. They've all been outstanding. Leonie Lloyd-Smith—the reason I just put her on the end is that she's someone most of you in this place would know. She has come to Canberra with me virtually every week for the last 10 years or so. She's the chief organiser of the staff nosh-up on Wednesday nights, so they may well miss Leonie's services. Vicki Manderson is also back in the Port Pirie office today holding the fort. They are a terrific staff—terrific because not only do they serve me loyally, as they should do, but they serve the electorate loyally. When people come in with their problems, they have the time, the patience and the compassion to sit down and talk through those problems. Both the electorate and I are well served by them, and I thank each and all of them. Some of them—in fact, three—have been with me for the entire 17 years, and one, Gen Wells, just a few months short of that.</span>

My other sister, Anne-Marie, is watching from home. Thank you, all, for being here and your support throughout my time in this parliament. My three wonderful children are all here today: Alex with her husband, Ben, and our grandson, Arthur. Can you give me a wave, Arthur? There you go! Good on you, fella. To Courtney and Lachlan, wonderful supporters: I thank you. I know you've given up a bit for me to have this career. I hope it's been rewarded in other ways. Certainly one thing we haven't done is lose touch. At the time we made the decision for me to have a go at this job, Lachlan was actually at university in Adelaide and living in our unit. While they always needed us, they didn't need me to drop them off at footy and netball anymore, so it was a good time for us, and for me.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This brings me to the last and most important person, my beautiful wife, Teresa, my soulmate of 46 years plus. In Mark's terms—he treaded the platform before me—many people consider her to be the second member for Grey. We get two for the price of one. She has driven some of the countless kilometres that we've travelled around the electorate, has dealt with behind-the-scenes things like donations—we look forward to those; there'd be a lot of requests coming in for those—and, particularly in the early years—she's an art teacher by trade—set out the materials that come out of the office.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've been each other's sounding board, not always in furious agreement, sometimes just furious! It proves the strength of our relationship that we can have a very vigorous discussion about things and then just move on. Because there's no doubt we still love each other. I love Teresa, and I'm so privileged to have had her in my life. Many people have said to me over the years, 'You've got a driver, haven't you?' because we do about 80,000 kilometres a year, and I say, 'Yes. I had to marry her.'</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been a wonderful journey. We made the decision to embark upon it together. We are ending it, I guess in a privileged way, in that we were able to choose the time of our leaving. I'm working on, like I said, being a long time in that first group before I get to either of the second two, and going off and enjoying everything. Thank you all for your friendship and support.</span>

In particular, I want to say to Charlie, in his absence, but also to Teresa and to Robyn, thank you very much for your service to your electorates, to this parliament and to our country.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As was pointed out before by the three members, it is a family effort, and families make an enormous sacrifice in this business, and none more so than those who live in rural communities. The absence, given the long hours on the road and the long hours away from home, and the travel to Canberra from remote parts of Australia mean that there are extra burdens on people that come from regional areas. I do want to pay tribute to the families and the sacrifices that they've made; the hours that they've missed out on kids growing up; separation from grandchildren; and missing major events. It is truly a sacrifice that you've made.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To each of our colleagues—to Nola, to Mark and to Rowan: as each of you pointed out, you have a lot in common, having come in in 2007 and having served your respective parties loyally. Not only have you come from rural communities and shared the journey together but each of you share in common an innate sense of decency and trustworthiness and, ultimately, the total respect of your colleagues. To each of you, I wish you every success in the next phase of life. May you enjoy good health, good fortune and lots of time together. Can you also stop for a moment to pause and truly appreciate the contribution that you've made to your electorates and to your country. Of that you should be incredibly proud. Well done.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WALLACE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:54</span>):  I think they were hoping that I'd back up and be the fourth one to make a valedictory speech, but they can't get rid of me that easily! In continuation, on behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security: collectively, the bills that I spoke about earlier provide a suite of measures intended to uplift Australia's cybersecurity, including through mandated minimum security standards for smart devices, mandatory reporting of ransomware payments made by businesses, establishing a cyber incident review board and limited-use provisions to encourage private-public cooperation on cyber incidents, and reforms to the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018, including to bolster the protection of business-critical data and to simplify information sharing across industry and government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Bolstering Australia's cybersecurity is a whole-of-nation endeavour, and one in which the Australian business community can and must play a crucial role. The evidence supplied to the committee within 60 high-quality written submissions and over two days of public hearings demonstrates that, from the business community, there was broad support for the bills amongst most contributors to the inquiry. Many contributors had been involved in consultation prior to the bills being introduced, in connection to the 2023-2030 Australian Cyber Security Strategy. Although some witnesses had in-principle objections to aspects of the package, the majority of matters brought to the committee's attention concerned implementation or matters of detail.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to the matters raised, the committee has made a total of 12 recommendations, mostly aimed at ensuring the implementation of the package is as effective as possible and subject to ongoing review. These include recommendations for the government to ensure businesses are educated about the new ransomware reporting obligations and provided with clear administrative guidance on how the various aspects of the new legislation are intended to be interpreted and applied in practice. The committee has recommended a small number of technical amendments aimed at clarifying the operation of the ransomware reporting obligations in relation to incidents that do not affect a business's operations in Australia, clarifying the protection of material that is subject to legal professional privilege and ensuring the package's limited-use provisions are clearly expressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has also recommended that the Cyber Security Bill be subject to a statutory review by this committee after three years and that an existing statutory review of the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018 be deferred by two years. This will allow time both for the new reforms to be implemented and for the currently legislated independent review of the SOCI Act to be completed. The committee recognises that hardening Australia's cyber resilience and implementing the 2023-2030 Australian Cyber Security Strategy is an urgent priority of this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the committee, I extend my thanks to the range of organisations and individuals who contributed to the inquiry and helped inform the committee's report. I also thank my fellow committee members for their constructive and bipartisan approach, and I'll take this moment to thank the former chair of the committee, the member for Wills, for his work and dedication to the PJCIS. I have been on many committees in this place, serving as a committee member, chair or deputy chair, and, hand on heart, I can honestly say that there is no other committee with such a demanding workload as the PJCIS. The member for Wills has had some difficulties in recent times, and I want to send out a shout-out to him for those difficulties that he has encountered both in his electorate and in his family. It's a difficult role to be in in this place, but it is made even more difficult by virtue of being the chair of this committee, which is, as I said, one of the most onerous positions in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the new incoming member, Senator Raff Ciccone. He's already demonstrated a very significant willingness to work very closely with me and the coalition members of the committee. I thank him and all members of the committee, but, most importantly, I want to thank the members of the secretariat who managed to turn a very significant body of work around in a very short period of time. The members of the secretariat are absolute champions, and we thank them for their efforts. I commend the report to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr HAWKE:</span>
                    </a>  by leave—I rise to speak to the very important report that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services has conducted throughout the course of this year in response to the very serious matters that were revealed at the Tax Practitioners Board. Peter-John Collins, a partner of PwC, conspired with perhaps 20 to 30 people to monetise confidential Australian government information for the benefit of a particular consultancy firm, PwC, and its clients. I think there's an important signal to industry here that, if government is your main client and you're earning revenue of hundreds of millions of dollars from the government, you have to have the highest of standards and probity in relation to the transparency and operation of your business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Certainly the government is not to be ripped off, just like any other business in our economy and society. And, if the government is ripped off and we make the rules and we make the laws, the taxpayer rightly expects action in response from the parliament, the government and the authorities. While normally coalition members would be quite averse to red tape, regulatory burden, it's clear that we are supportive of a majority of the recommendations made in the committee report. I thank the committee chair, Senator O'Neill, for her great work and her dedication to this task, because we do agree with the need for greater governance, disclosure and transparency requirements being imposed on large professional partnerships, including the large multidisciplinary accounting practices, given their significance to the Australian economy and the way the consultancies are embedded in government work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, the inquiry has indicated there needs to be a range of forms implemented with respect to matters such as regulatory oversight, disciplinary procedure and the calibration of appropriate penalties for misconduct. We do agree with these recommendations because the revelations that partnerships were so large and people had no idea what was going on when we're talking about the theft of the Australian government's information and the monetisation of it overseas is deeply disturbing and does require transparency and other changes to ensure that this conduct, which may have been isolated to particular people within firms, isn't abused in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are, of course, a limited number of recommendations where the coalition does have reservations. We appreciate the intent, but we do think the recommendations go too far. In particular, there was idea that reforms would be staged in a way that would take existing businesses, with large partnerships being the example, and then somehow reduce those to an arbitrary number. There was no evidence about this, in our view, and indeed the recommendation were to reduce to 400 partners. It's very unclear how this would work or could be implemented in practice, and it was a very arbitrary figure that was argued about by the committee without an evidence base that that would produce a particular better result. I would mention that, in theory, we do not oppose the idea of capping partnerships in the future or having a future based cap in terms of the number of partners within these firms. Certainly, the government has previously passed laws that increased the cap to 1,000 partners. Reducing to 400 does feel arbitrary. It may not work and it would create great economic chaos without benefit, so we certainly have concern about that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the other recommendations, I point to the fact that we do indeed support many of the strong recommendations that have come through in the course of the inquiry. It's paramount, of course, to have trust in the auditing services provided by firms, given the function of providing independent truth isn't marred by secrecy or this lack of transparency for regulators and the government when it inquires.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given that all the partnerships are the model that is adopted by the big four in Australia, this is a signal from the government, a signal from the committee and a signal from the parliament that we are serious about reform in this sector. The UK has taken a series of reforms that are more strident in many ways. We've made recommendations, and some of those have to be scaled back. But this is a clear signal from both sides of the committee—and there are many recommendations; this is a substantial reform of the sector—that we want increased accountability and response mechanisms but also cultural change, and that cultural change won't come without some regulatory and systemic change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why there are so many recommendations. Sometimes recommendations are overdone in these committee reports, but the signal to this sector, which is now critical to the functioning of our economy, couldn't be clearer. We require standards of governance, and we're recommending that the Corporations Act be amended in a number of ways, including to make sure that public interest entities, which all the big four would be designated as being, are required to have their financial reports audited and a public tender process undertaken every 10 years. Again, we've spelt out measures that we think will actually make a difference in public trust, in trust from the government and in trust from the taxpayer in making a difference to the future, given the central role these firms are now playing in the models.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I would say to these partnerships: you need to get your own house in order. This committee has had to take the embarrassing steps of heavy-handed regulation because of the cultural situation in many of these firms. The 'see no evil, hear no evil' model is unsustainable in 2024, especially when you work for the government, who makes the laws and the rules. Then, if the government is ripped off and the taxpayer is ripped off, you can expect, with our secret information, heavy-handed regulation to come forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do want change. We want cultural change, transparency change and structural change. But I would say to the firms: Make the changes positively. Get ahead of legislative and regulatory change, and you'll be in a better position. It's really where you should be anyway. And read the room around the world, where governments are cracking down on these opaque arrangements that are producing very poor outcomes, including the monetisation of secret information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, thank you for the opportunity today. I want to thank the committee's chair, Senator O'Neill, and all my colleagues on the committee, on all sides. It was a very collegiate process. We did find some shocking information about cultures within firms. It was very disappointing and I think confronting to understand that some of these very high-reputation firms don't have the highest of standards behind the scenes in terms of governance, transparency and what might be expected by the public and by the Australian government. So I want thank all the committee members for all the work that's been done, and the secretariat in particular. I'd have to say that this committee took all the submissions that came through from the public  very seriously—from whistleblowers, from people who came forward. I thank them for coming forward and providing us with all the information. I believe that in the report we've done a very effective job of incorporating the concerns of the public, business, people who have worked within these firms, whistleblowers in the past and people who've sought change. I think change can come out of this report. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MASCARENHAS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:08</span>):  by leave—I take the opportunity to speak on the tabling of the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, of which I'm a member. This report follows the inquiry into ethics and professional accountability: structural challenges in the audit, assurance and consultancy industry. This inquiry is a statement to the strength of our democracy. It shows that parliament has a critical role to play in holding our institutions accountable. It proves that our democratic systems are alive and well. And I agree with the member for Mitchell, the deputy chair, that this has been an incredibly collegiate committee. I commend the chair of the committee, Senator Deb O'Neill, for her leadership and commitment to this important work, as well as all committee members: the deputy chair; the members for Fraser, Adelaide and Petrie; and Senators Pratt, Pocock, Bragg and Scarr. Their dedication ensured that this inquiry was thorough and impactful. I also extend my appreciation to the witnesses who contributed. Their insights, expertise and lived experience guided the committee. Without their courage and willingness to speak, this report would not have been possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inquiry began in 2023, prompted by serious revelations. Misconduct in the audit, insurance and consultancy sector came to light. At the heart of this scandal was the PwC tax leak scandal, which exposed unethical practices and breaches of trust. This inquiry was vital. People needed to be held accountable. Today we table a report that uncovers the full extent of the misconduct. It shows how confidential government information was misused by partners and employees of PwC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report makes 40 recommendations. First, it proposes a cap of 400 partners for firms structured as partnerships. This is a reduction from the current 1,000 and aligns these firms with the limits already in place for law firms. I support the position, and the recommendation is sensible and is needed. Second, the report calls for an operational separation of audit functions in multidisciplinary professional service firms. Audit clients should not be able to access other firms from the same firm. This will reduce conflicts of interest and improve trust in the audit process. Third, the report recommends the introduction of accountability measures for consultants. This includes a public register of consultants, a consultancy code of conduct and a compliance body to oversee the sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the committee recommends that PwC should not be allowed to tender for government contracts until all legal investigations are complete. This sends a clear message: unethical behaviour will not be tolerated. It will also be an important measure in rebuilding public trust in the institution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inquiry also revealed deep failures in governance. Conflicts of interest were widespread. Practices that undermined our national interest went unchecked. If not for this inquiry, many of these issues may never have come to light. This is unacceptable. It must not happen again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee's recommendations are forward thinking and are made in the national interest. Australia deserves a consultancy sector that is ethical, transparent and accountable. Trust in our institutions matters. It underpins our democracy, our economy and our fundamental way of life. When institutions fail, it hurts us all. This report is about rebuilding trust. It's about ensuring these values are not repeated. It's about protecting the stability and integrity of our systems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we take a step forward. We hold those responsible to account. We recommit to the values that make our democracy strong. I commend this report to the House.</span>

                    </a>  by leave—This report follows the committee's second interim report that was tabled in the House in October. That report examined how the decision of Meta to abandon deals under the News Media Bargaining Code could influence the provision and consumption of public interest journalism in Australia and give rise to mis and disinformation. It also found that while the code was established in good faith, its implementation has revealed significant shortcomings. Accordingly, the committee made 11 considered recommendations to improve the effectiveness of the code and the sustainability of public interest journalism and digital media in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This third and final report looks closely at the influences and impacts of social media on Australian society. The committee received 220 submissions throughout the inquiry, conducted 10 public hearings and received additional written responses to many questions on notice. We heard from experts, academics, bureaucrats, big tech companies, advocates, grieving families and young Australians who have grown up with digital technology all their lives. Social media users in Australia are some of the most active in the world, with approximately 81 per cent of all Australians reporting that they were regular users of social media in 2023.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While acknowledging that social media is a huge part of everyday life for most Australians, this final report examines social media in its entirety—the good, the bad and the ugly. The committee heard that social media can be addictive and disruptive to offline activities. It can impact on sleep, lead to mis- and disinformation being shared and consumed and poor mental health and, at its worst, expose vulnerable users to online predators, unhealthy expectations around body image, bullying and sextortion. In some tragic cases, it can lead people to extremely dangerous self-harming behaviours, such as eating disorders and suicidality. We heard that much more needs to be done to protect Australians from these harms, particularly by social media companies themselves, who make money by keeping their users engaged. Social media is never free, because users pay for it with their attention. As one young witness observed, if the product is free then you are the product. This statement reflects the true nature of social media platforms. They provide a free space for community and connection, but in exchange the user is beholden to the business decisions of big tech companies, whose focus is squarely on increasing revenue without consideration for the health and wellbeing of their customer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This report puts big tech on notice. Social media companies are not immune to the need to have a social licence to operate here in Australia. Participants to the inquiry also painted a picture of how the relationship Australians have with social media is complex and forever evolving. We were told that many Australians, particularly young Australians, enjoyed using social media and, for the most part, they didn't want their access to it to be restricted. As one young person said, social media isn't just a platform; it's a lifeline for connection, information and community for many young people. But we also heard that social media companies use opaque algorithms that keep users scrolling, feeding us what they think we want to see, even if it is harmful. Young people recognise these harms and the vulnerabilities of some users, but they wanted to better protect themselves from harms and have more control over their social media experience to better improve their own health and wellbeing. They want to be able to alter, set or indeed turn off their personal algorithms and recommended systems. They want greater control over the content and paid advertising they see and when they see it, and they want to be active participants in co-designing policy to help improve the safety and accountability of online platforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee also heard from mental health organisations who told us how social media is used to support people's mental health and wellbeing, with many Australians accessing mental health resources online. But they too agreed that some harms were so extreme that interventions were required and much more should be done to protect users from online harms. Academics and experts spoke to the many different facets of the social media environment, including its harms, noting that there is no one silver bullet that is going to solve this problem. But they were adamant that this shouldn't stop us from taking immediate action to better protect Australian users. We heard that, while legislating an age limit might not be the perfect solution and should certainly not be the only solution, it would provide important breathing space for the implementation of long-term sustainable digital reforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the committee also heard from parents regarding the horrific online harm experienced by their children, with some parents drawing a direct link between the influence and impact of social media use and their child's mental health and wellbeing. We heard about young users suffering eating disorders who are continuously shown social media content that is harmful to their recovery, and we heard about vulnerable young people who are endlessly bullied and sextorted via social media, leading to them taking their own lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Parents presenting evidence to the committee pleaded for an increase in the minimum age for children to access social media, noting the current restrictions had failed. Without a legislated minimum age to access social media, parents said, they felt unsupported in their efforts to protect their kids from social harms. They wanted to be able to tell their kids, 'No. It's the law. You have to wait until you're old enough.' And they worried that social media companies would take years to implement reforms that made them responsible for their platforms and for preventing online harms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While everyone agrees that social media is part of everyday life and will remain so, social media platforms and online services have a key responsibility for the safety of their users. This report makes recommendations for immediate and long-term government action, but it also puts the responsibility back onto big tech, who absolutely must do better. It contains 12 well-defined recommendations that go to the heart of the problem: keeping Australian users safe. The report recommendations include greater enforceability of laws to bring digital platforms under Australian jurisdiction; support for a single and overarching statutory duty of care for digital platforms to ensure Australian users, particularly children, are safe online; effective mandatory data access for independent researchers and public interest organisations, coupled with a rigorous auditing process by appropriate regulators; measures to enable users to have greater control over the content they see by having the ability to alter, reset or turn off their personal algorithms and recommended systems; greater protections for users' personal information; inclusion of young Australians in the co-design process for the regulation of social media; research and data collection provisions that enable evidence based policy development; ongoing education to improve digital competency and online safety skills; built-in safety-by-design principles for current and future platform technology; a transparent complaints mechanism that incorporates a right-of-appeal process; and adequate resourcing for the office of the eSafety Commissioner to discharge its ever-evolving functions. Taken together, these recommendations map a pathway forward for social media reforms in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee notes that in the past two weeks the government has announced the introduction of legislation to make 16 the minimum age of access for social media. Other recent measures include legislation to combat the rise of mis- and disinformation and a landmark scams prevention framework which calls for fines of up to $50 million and requires social media platforms, banks and telecommunications companies to protect Australians from online scams. And just last week the government announced that it will be legislating a digital duty of care to place the onus on digital platforms to proactively keep Australians safe and better prevent online harms in the first place. These actions are part of a suite of government reforms that complement each other and incentivise the design of a safer, healthier digital platforms ecosystem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee strongly supports the 12 recommendations in this final report, along with the recommendations of our second interim report. Collectively, these 23 recommendations map a pathway forward for social media reforms in Australia and put big tech on notice, because social media companies are not immune from the need to have a social licence to operate in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to sincerely thank the secretariat, who have worked hard to meet the committee's deadlines and have been exceptional in providing support to the committee. Thank you to the committee secretary, Gerry McInally; Aysha Osborne; Natasha Rusjakovski; Michael Perks; Aisha Bottrill; and Jamison Eddington. I would also like to thank—I see her sitting at the table—the former chair of this committee, the member for Jagajaga and assistant minister, for her diligent work in the first iteration of this committee. I also want to acknowledge all of the committee members—some of whom I see sitting in the chamber this evening—who have worked productively with me throughout this inquiry. It doesn't mean we haven't had our challenges and differences, but we have landed in a place where there is a good collective will to ensure improved online safety for all Australian users.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My message is simple: the age of unregulated social media is over. Online safety is paramount and social media platforms must take responsibility to ensure fundamental protections are in place. Social media has a social responsibility for the safety of their users, and this report maps out ways in which they can be held to account, ensuring social media is a safe place for all Australians to find connection, community and reliable information.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WALLACE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:26</span>):  by leave—I begin by thanking the member for Newcastle for stepping in as chair for the committee and the member for Jagajaga for the work that she did before her elevation. This was a comprehensive inquiry with 220 submissions, 10 public hearings, 58 responses to questions on notice and three reports. The coalition members of the committee welcome the recommendations made by the committee, including a statutory duty of care and a children's online privacy code.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having said that, I feel that it would be remiss of me if I didn't point out that I think that if the report was left as is it would be seen as a missed opportunity. Coalition members felt compelled to provide not a dissenting report but additional comments, and there were some 16,000 words in that additional commentary, which we believe fills a gap in this report. Simply put, coalition members believe that government members of the committee have missed the opportunity to demonstrate the strong leadership required for the kind of comprehensive reform which social media platforms desperately need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 3 January 2018, Dolly Everett took her life as a result of very, very significant bullying. Most of us would remember that day, and I have to say it was a day in my life that I remember well. Shortly after Dolly's passing, I went down to Sydney, New South Wales, and had a meeting with the DIGI group, where all of the social media platforms and big tech are represented. I made the executives of the DIGI group a promise that I would be a thorn in their side for however long they continued to not look after the welfare of Australians and, in particular, the welfare of Australian children. I made them that promise, and today I feel somewhat vindicated that that promise has been, or is being, delivered on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Big tech companies have proven utterly incapable of protecting their users from harm, and Australians demand strong leadership to hold them to account. I remember walking out of that meeting with the DIGI group thinking that I had just met with big tobacco from the 1960s and the1970s. I was assured that everything was all under control and that platforms were doing everything that they humanly possibly could to protect Australians. We all know that that is not true.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Coalition members were concerned that, despite the significant evidence provided by witnesses, the committee failed to give enough attention to the issues of child safety, foreign interference and mental health, particularly in relation to eating disorders and addiction. A parliamentary inquiry such as this one should freely offer recommendations to government to steer policy and find practical solutions to real-world policy problems with far-reaching consequences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Coalition members want user-control features which address persuasive design issues. That includes resetting your algorithm, stopping autoplay and infinite scrolling and having the ability to better customise one's social media feeds. Coalition members would like to see greater transparency and reporting requirements in relation to actual or suspected foreign interference or transnational commercial activities. Coalition members would like to see a centre of digital education excellence established to bolster Australia's digital technology and media literacy. Coalition members want a proactive obligation on social media companies to report actual or suspected child sexual abuse and exploitation, regardless of whether end-to-end inscription is used.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Coalition members want a proactive obligation on search engines and similar platforms to report how they are combatting the indexation and dissemination of harmful material. Coalition members want big tech to be held accountable for harmful materials published by connected third-party platforms, including link-in-bio tools. Coalition members want the government to work with experts, youth representatives and lived-experience participants to develop a strategy to improve the online safety and wellbeing of boys, who are disproportionately affected by online harms, particularly in relation to sextortion. Coalition members want the government to invest in the research and development of technology to combat child sexual exploitation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Coalition members want social media companies to provide regular transparency reports on data collection. Coalition members want regular reports on revenue received from the advertising of regulated and restricted industries like alcohol, gambling, pornography, cigarettes, pharmaceuticals, weight-loss treatments, debt collection and more. Coalition members want the government to adequately resource the eSafety Commissioner and the Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation to meet increasing demand on their services. Coalition members want a new parliamentary committee—like other committees before this one—on online safety, artificial intelligence and technology, tasked with responding to and preparing Australia for the growing threats and opportunities in social media technology and AI.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is imperative that a standing committee be established. This committee is handing down its report today, but it's likely to be out of date in a couple of months time, and having a standing committee which can keep abreast of the constant changes in this area will stand this country in good stead. The jurisdiction that this standing committee should have would also include dating apps, gaming platforms, live-streaming programs, the Metaverse and more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition members have put together an alternative report to highlight the serious issues which the existing report fails to address. We've nominated 13 additional recommendations to protect Australians online. We've demonstrated, once again, that the coalition is leading the charge on social media reform and online safety. I want to acknowledge the efforts and the receptiveness of the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for communications, David Coleman, and acknowledge their great work in leading social media reform. At this point, I also want to thank my partner in crime, the member for Flinders, for her outstanding work on this committee and in relation to online safety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that only the coalition can be trusted to keep kids safe online. Only the coalition has the courage to hold big tech to account. I commend the report and additional comments to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Capricornia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:36</span>):  The coalition supports the policy intent of the bills, the Cyber Security Bill 2024, the Intelligence Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Cyber Security) Bill 2024 and the Security of Critical Infrastructure and Other Legislation Amendment (Enhanced Response and Prevention) Bill 2024. As cyber threats continually evolve and the strategic environment continues to deteriorate, urgent action is required to uplift Australia's national cyber resilience.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reforms introduced by this package of legislation represent a logical extension of the world-leading approach taken by the former coalition government, who architected the security-of-critical-infrastructure regime and authored successive national cybersecurity strategies in 2016 and 2020. However, we continue to hold significant concerns, as do many interested stakeholders, about the government's rushed process and limited time for parliamentary scrutiny, which increases the risk of overlooking unintended consequences and drafting errors in the legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The former coalition government introduced the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018, which outlined the legal obligations for entities that own, operate or have direct interests in critical infrastructure assets and included government assistance powers for serious cybersecurity threats or attacks. The former coalition government amended the SOCI Act in 2021 and again in 2022 to enhance security obligations for critical infrastructure assets and systems of national significance, including by introducing mandatory risk management programs for certain assets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the wake of the Optus and Medibank cyber incidents in 2022, the former Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Cyber Security, Clare O'Neil, trashed the SOCI Act:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That law was bloody useless, not worth the ink printed on the paper when it came to actually using it in a cyber incident. It was poorly drafted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On a separate occasion she praised the SOCI reforms, saying, 'If you look at the work that was done on the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act in the last parliament, when I describe that law to politicians around the world their mouths are open, thinking, "How can we construct something similar in our country?"'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is somewhat ironic that the backbone of Labor's much-touted cyber legislation is a modest and logical extension of the SOCI reforms introduced by the previous government. Clare O'Neil's desperation to politicise what should be bipartisan national security policy is emblematic of Labor's chaotic approach to national security writ large. It is good to see the government has finally seen reason as to the merits of the coalition's world-leading SOCI reforms to the point that it has decided to double down on our approach, and we welcome the measures in the Security of Critical Infrastructure and Other Legislation Amendment (Enhanced Response and Prevention) Bill 2024. We welcome the limited-use provisions in the Cyber Security Bill and the Intelligence Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Cyber Security) Bill 2024, the ISA bill, which will provide assurance to entities that the information they disclose to government about cyber incidents will not be used against entities' interests in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The former director-general of the Australian Security Directorate, Ms Rachel Noble, publicly endorsed this concept in November 2022:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Speaking purely from ASD's perspective, I think the safe harbour concept is a most excellent idea because, to your point, where there is ambiguity—if I'm dealing with a government, do you hand that information to other government departments or don't you? How can I be sure that that won't occur without my permission and so forth?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">So from an operational perspective, in the heat of the incident, if you will, when we're still trying to pull people out of the water and into the lifeboats, to have that absolute confidence for the private sector, that at the very least their operational engagement with ASD would be exempted from the inquiry of others, whether they are other government agencies or other people scrutinising the process, like we've seen in class action lawsuits, for example, that is very attractive to us as well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Paterson first called for a legislated limited-use obligation on 22 March 2023. I note that, if the Australian government had moved more quickly with this reform, it may have gone some way to address the declining willingness from industry to share information with ASD in a timely way, which have we witnessed in the intervening years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed mandatory standards for smart devices in the Cyber Security Bill 2024 are welcome and long overdue. This proposal was first canvassed by the former coalition government in the discussion paper, 'Strengthening Australia's cyber security regulations and incentives: an initiative of Australia's cyber security strategy 2020', released on 13 July 2021. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The need for these reports has become more acute in recent years, as we have learned more about the national security risks of internet-connected devices through successive audits, which revealed hundreds of Chinese-manufactured cameras, drones and internet-connected solar inverters in use across Commonwealth government sites. The Commonwealth government has had ample time to develop and refine this proposal, and we welcome this work finally coming to fruition. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition welcomes the introduction of the legislated Cyber Incident Review Board, the CIRB. Senator Paterson originally called for this construct on 19 November 2023, noting the need for a mechanism to conduct dispassionate, objective investigations following significant cyber incidents, for the collective benefit of organisations who may be able to benefit from the lessons learned. This came after the US government announced the establishment of the Cyber Safety Review Board in 2021. Had the Australian government acted sooner to establish a construct here, it may have assisted post-incident investigations into significant incidents such as the MediSecure data breach and the CrowdStrike outage, which both occurred earlier this year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nevertheless, the coalition welcomes the establishment of the CIRB—however belated—noting the clarification provided during the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security inquiry that standing members of the Cyber Incident Review Board do not necessarily need to be members of the public service, which will provide flexibility to include representatives external to government if the minister deems it appropriate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the coalition supports the policy intent of the bills, we continue to hold significant concerns about the Albanese Labor government's rushed process and limited time for parliamentary scrutiny, which increases the risk of overlooking unintended consequences and drafting errors in the legislation. The former Minister for Home Affairs and former Minister for Cyber Security, the Hon. Clare O'Neil MP, originally announced the development of the 2023-2030 Australian Cyber Security Strategy on 8 December 2022. The cyber strategy was released on 22 November 2023 and, on 19 December 2023, the Department of Home Affairs released a consultation paper on legislated reforms arising from the cyber strategy, which informed the current bills. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Department of Home Affairs consulted on a targeted exposure draft of the proposed legislation reform package between 4 and 11 September 2024. The government introduced the bills into the House on 9 October 2024 and referred the package to the PJCIS on the same day, with submissions due by 25 October 2024. This means that stakeholders had only two weeks to make a submission on the bills, and the PJCIS had just over a month to consider and report on the bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given these reforms have been in train for close to two years, it is inexplicable that the government has seen fit to reduce the time for parliamentary scrutiny in its desperation to pass this legislation before the end of the year. Multiple stakeholders shared these concerns during the PJCIS inquiry. The government has shown a flagrant disregard for these concerns, and it remains abundantly clear that the condensed inquiry timeframe is insufficient to properly scrutinise such highly complex and consequential legislation. The PJCIS report canvases numerous concerns and potential issues already identified through this inquiry. It stands to reason that a more fulsome scrutiny process would reveal even more areas that warrant further consideration. The coalition has repeatedly cautioned against this impetuous approach, and any unintended consequences that arise in the future as a result of this rushed process lie solely with the government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition supports the policy intent of the legislative package. In the face of a complex and evolving threat environment, the Commonwealth government needs robust leaders to protect Australians from cyberthreats. Industry should also be able to engage quickly and confidently with government in responding to cyber challenges, and we welcome the limited use provisions which will go some way to facilitating this culture of cooperation. The coalition will be supporting these bills without amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislative package comprises three bills which seek to implement reforms emerging from the 2023-2030 Australian Cyber Security Strategy. The Cyber Security Bill 2024 has four elements. It introduces a power to make mandatory security standards for smart devices, also known as Internet of Things, or IoT, devices, requiring entities to implement security standards specified by the Minister for Home Affairs. There is an accompanying enforcement and compliance regime which will allow the Secretary of the Department of Home Affairs to issue compliance, stop and recall notices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It introduces mandatory reporting obligations, requiring entities who are affected by a cyber incident to report to the Australian Signals Directorate if they make a ransomware payment or give other benefits in connection to the cybersecurity incident, enforced by civil penalty provisions. This obligation applies to entities with an annual turnover of more than $3 million—noting this threshold can be altered by the minister—as well as entities responsible for critical minerals that are already subject to mandatory cyber incident reporting under the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It establishes a limited time obligation that restricts how information that is provided to the National Cyber Security Coordinator during a cyber incident can be used and on-shared by other government entities. This also enshrines the cyber coordinator role in legislation and confirms the voluntary basis by which an entity provides information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It establishes an independent cyber incident review board, with limited information-gathering powers, to conduct no-fault reviews of significant cyber incidents and to compel information from entities involved in a cybersecurity incident under review where voluntary requests for information have been unsuccessful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Intelligence Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Cyber Security) Bill 2024 has two schedules. Schedule 1 amends the Intelligence Services Act 2001 to legislate the limited use obligation to protect information voluntarily provided to or acquired or prepared by ASD during an impacted entity's engagement in relation to a cybersecurity incident. This mirrors the equivalent provision for the coordinator enshrined in the Cyber Security Bill and specifies permitted purposes for information sharing. The bill also prevents ASD from communicating limited cybersecurity information for the purposes of investigating or enforcing a contravention of a Commonwealth, state or territory law, other than a criminal offence, against an impacted entity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments do not impact the reporting and notification requirements of entities under existing legislation to Australian regulatory bodies; preclude other government agencies, including regulators, from seeking or acquiring such information directly from entities under existing information-gathering powers; or provide a shield or safe harbour for entities against legal liability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 amends the Freedom of Information Act to exempt from FOI requests any information received by the coordinator under the limited use obligation, noting that ASD is already exempt from the FOI Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Security of Critical Infrastructure and Other Legislation Amendment (Enhanced Response and Prevention) Bill 2024, the SOCI bill, has six elements. It expands the definition of 'critical infrastructure assets' to include secondary assets which hold business-critical data and relate to the functioning of the primary asset to capture data storage systems that could impact the critical infrastructure and expands SOCI government assistant powers to facilitate the use of a last-resort directions power for the Secretary of the Department of Home Affairs when authorised by the minister for the purposes of managing both multi-asset incidents and the consequences of serious incidents which could have, are having or have had a relevant impact on one or more critical infrastructure assets. This facilitates the management of consequences stemming from all hazard incidents; however, it does not extend powers relating to intervention requests, which remain limited to cyberincidents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It introduces a revised harms based definition of 'protected information' under SOCI and clarifies the operation of the secrecy and disclosure provisions, in particular to enable greater intergovernmental sharing of protected information across industry collaboration. It reduces the unnecessary burdens of these provisions on entities in the ordinary conduct of business, introduces a review-and-remedy directions power for the Secretary of the Department of Home Affairs or the relevant Commonwealth regulator which is exercisable where it has been identified a critical infrastructure risk management program is seriously deficient. It moves certain security notification obligations under the telecommunications sector security reforms, TSSRs, administered by the Home Affairs portfolio, into the SOCI act and clarifies and aligns the regulations, including by creating a new part in the SOCI act for critical telecommunications assets. This includes consequential amendments to the telecommunications interception and access act and other acts. It removes direct interest holders from administrative obligations associated with systems of national significance, SONS, to protect the identity of SONS and reduce the risk of inappropriate information disclosure.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Richmond</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Social Services and Assistant Minister for the Prevention of Family Violence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:54</span>):  I rise in continuation on this very, very important bill, the National Broadband Network Companies Amendment (Commitment to Public Ownership) Bill 2024. I am pleased to be speaking in continuation further on this particular bill, as the Albanese government is committed to keeping the NBN in public ownership. We've made that very clear. We want to keep it in public ownership, because we believe the NBN needs to stay in full government ownership to support the ongoing upgrade of the network, which is absolutely vital, and to ensure ongoing regulatory oversight of NBN wholesale pricing, keeping broadband affordable for Australians, particularly as those upgrades continue in regional and rural areas I spoke about in my initial contribution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The need to have constant upgrades of the NBN and connectivity is absolutely vital for our regional communities. In a community like mine, there are so many reasons why it's absolutely vital. We have a huge number of small businesses in my area of northern New South Wales. They're the backbone of our local economy. Those businesses need to be connected. People need to have access to NBN and connectivity for many work purposes. Of course, it needs to be in place for a whole range of educational purposes, and people need to have that access and connectivity there for many personal needs too.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even more so, in areas like mine and other areas that are prone to natural disasters, we need to have access to communication services, and we need to know that we're able to access those services. Certainly, in our devastating floods of 2022, which I've spoken about here many times, one of the big issues was the lack of connectivity and communication. We need to ensure that we have as many services as possible in place to assist our communities—for all of those everyday reasons that people need in communities and, even more so, in regional areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has been making an ongoing investment in the NBN to bring the benefits of high-speed broadband to many more Australians. This government support includes a commitment of $2.4 billion to replace the deteriorating copper network with fibre, which will provide 90 per cent of Australians—around 10 million premises—in the NBN fixed line footprint with access to faster and more reliable broadband. We have been rolling that out in so many communities. This investment is already delivering benefits, with increased reliability, fewer faults and access to higher speeds. In addition, the government and NBN Co are delivering a $750 million investment to upgrade services in the NBN fixed wireless network, which has flow-on benefits to NBN satellite services, which are, of course, very vital as well in many regional and rural areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned before the need to have these services in times of natural disasters—in my area, particularly with those devastating floods. We have a whole series of measures that help communities like mine. One of those is the STAND program, the Strengthening Telecommunications Against Natural Disasters program. We've had installations right across the country. In my area we've had installations at the Tweed Shire Council civic centre auditorium and also at the Mullumbimby Rural Fire Service brigade. It's important to have those STAND programs in place so that there can be a backup of NBN Sky Muster satellite services under that program and under other programs that we're rolling out. As I said, when we had our flood in 2022 there were absolutely no communications available at all, so the increase in that emergency backup satellite access is so important for our area and any other areas that are, unfortunately, subject to those natural disasters. There are many throughout the nation, so increasing our investment in STAND and other programs helps those communities become more resilient, which is all part of the resilience programs and the mitigation measures that we need to have in place to assist our communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The increase in towers that we see, particularly in regional areas, is vital too. We've had many in the north coast of New South Wales recently, and I have supported each and every one of those for all the reasons I outlined, as well as the need for emergency services and for residents to have access not only in natural disasters but in their everyday lives. For example, thankfully, there is a tower underway at Newrybar, which will be providing a whole lot of increased connectivity to many areas, particularly Bangalow, which has had horrific access to the NBN. Having that tower is the only way to ensure that those people can get, and stay, connected. I have 100 per cent supported that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many years ago, in my area, unfortunately, there was some very criminal activity which damaged one of the towers. I spoke out at the time and absolutely condemned that. We need to have these towers in place in our regional areas, and I've supported all of those that are coming online in my community. Some of those, of course, do receive government funding, particularly through our Peri-Urban Mobile Program. We announced one just a couple of weeks ago, with funding for new mobile phone infrastructure for the Optus network in the Kingscliff area, another area that has had many issues in terms of connectivity. I've only mentioned two of the towers, but there are others—and we need to have them in place because it is obviously a lot more difficult in those regional areas in terms of being able to access all sorts of communications services. So I will continue to encourage all forms of communication that assist regional communities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through this bill the National Broadband Network Companies Act will be amended to remove conditions enabling a future government to privatise NBN Co. These changes reinforce in legislation our government's commitment. It is absolutely resolute. The bill provides certainty to everyone—to stakeholders—including so many broadband consumers, the wider telecommunications industry, broadband retailers and NBN Co, that the Commonwealth will continue to retain ownership of NBN Co. Very importantly, it provides certainty to all consumers, particularly those consumers in regional and rural Australia who are so dependent on their communications access. This certainty supports the government's commitment for NBN Co to provide high-speed and reliable broadband connectivity for all Australians. That is our commitment and that is why NBN Co must remain in public ownership. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the bill to the House. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="306489" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CALDWELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:01</span>):  I rise tonight to speak against this bill, the National Broadband Network Companies Amendment (Commitment to Public Ownership) Bill 2024, and in doing so I think it is worth reflecting briefly on the history of where this came from. We'll recall that a few weeks ago the Prime Minister in question time had a particularly bad afternoon. He popped into the chamber late that night, issued an apology to the people of Australia, and then promptly, the next day, absolutely out of nowhere, we found this new piece of bright, shiny legislation which is nothing more—and was nothing more at the time—than a complete distraction, a shiny bauble so that people stopped thinking about either the Prime Minister's actions or what was actually going on in their life at the time. What we ended up with is six pieces of paper that form this unbelievably unimportant piece of legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll refer, for example, to some legislation that was introduced earlier today, just to give those viewing at home a little bit of a sense of what six pages might achieve. Earlier today we saw some legislation introduced that was 227 pages long—substantial reform. So what on earth might we or the government be trying to achieve with these six pages? I can tell you what they're trying to achieve: really, not much more than the complete distraction and smokescreen that I referred to. It doesn't do more than a front page headline for them to use, which is: National Broadband Network Companies Amendment (Commitment to Public Ownership). There we have it, ladies and gentlemen. That's your headline. That's the distraction. What it shows is the level of desperation that this government have two weeks out from the end of the year, when there are two more sitting weeks. They are completely out of ideas on issues that are genuinely important to Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can tell you that this issue about the public ownership of the NBN is almost the furthest thing from the minds of the average Australian at the moment. I get around the electorate. I talk to people. I stand outside a supermarket or walk through the park. I can tell you that none of them are coming up to me, saying, 'Geez, I really think that we should change that piece of legislation about the potential future sale of the NBN because I'm really worried about that.' No. What they're saying is: 'I'm really worried about my grocery bill. I'm really worried about my electricity bill.' And what are we seeing from this Labor government? We're seeing not much on those issues. In fact, we know that this is really just a sneaky distraction because not even the government itself has been talking about the NBN. The Prime Minister himself last mentioned this on 3 July, and it's only been mentioned a few times in parliament this whole year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll give credit to people where it's due, but I'm just thinking that there's something quite cynical about this whole thing. Part of it is in what we saw from the member for Richmond, who is one of the better performing local members out of a very bad government—I'll give her that—maybe using this time in the public domain that's streamed out to lounge rooms cross Australia and watched frivolously on various social media channels to talk about how amazing the coverage is in suburbs like Kingscliff and Newrybar. That's all fantastic, but that's not actually what this bill is about. This bill is a bill to try and amend some provisions of legislation that was brought in almost 14 years ago to the day. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The irony of this is that the distraction tactic chosen by the PM has given us as an opposition some time now to really delve into the history of the NBN. What I love more than anything in life is a dose of irony. The biggest dose of irony that I think we've found in our subsequent research is that, at a time when we all know the Prime Minister was famously the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport—and I understand he was very concerned about how aeroplanes were getting around at that time—he momentarily showed an interest in the NBN, almost 14 years ago to the day, in his second reading speech to this place on Thursday 25 November 2010. So the Prime Minister himself actually tabled the legislation, about which he says in his speech:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It also sets out arrangements for the eventual sale of the Commonwealth's stake in the company once the NBN rollout is complete, including provisions for independent and parliamentary reviews prior to any privatisation, and for the parliament to have the final say on the sale.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm just finding it quite curious that, 14 years later, the Prime Minister now feels it's time to go back on what he thought was a pretty good idea then, by amending these provisions with the seven pages of flimsy legislation that have been put forward. It would seem to support the fact that the whole basis of this is really nothing more than a splash of a headline. Perhaps it's a distraction, but I think it's probably something more. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know from this period of time, if we go back to 2010, that another Labor luminary who was right in on this NBN action at the time, Senator Stephen Conroy, was going ballistic in the media, with press release after press release. The press release that was issued on 22 November 2010 has the heading 'Government committed to sale of NBN Co'. Again, I'm finding it extraordinary that the very people who are now trying to save the NBN from some fanciful sale offering are actually the ones that created the vehicle and the idea for the whole thing in the first place. Senator Conroy was very clear in what he was expecting at the time, and the Prime Minister—the then Minister for Infrastructure and Transport—was very clear when he gave his second reading speech. The press release says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Senator Conroy said the Gillard Government remained firmly committed to selling its stake in NBN Co after the network was fully built and operational, subject to market conditions and security considerations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has always said any sale of NBN Co will be subject to a Productivity Commission inquiry before any sale takes place. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They clearly thought about this a lot because there's an entire process that's set up with what we might describe in the modern vernacular as guardrails so that this thing would go really well and maximise the public interest and the financial outcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It just seems extraordinary, again, that I reflect that in 2024, almost 14 years to the day after this press release, I'm standing in this same place now with this Labor government undoing the very thing that it set out to achieve. I find some of this really quite interesting, in that there were some very clear steps set out as to how any potential sale could take place. I'm going to step through those because this is not something where a third party could just run out into the world, stick it on the internet with a 'for sale' sign and sell it to the highest bidder. It's not like that. The legislation is very clear, and perhaps, to give them some credit, they thought this through. It provides about five simple steps that would need to be attended to before any sale could be completed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, the NBN has to be complete. We know that that's the case. It was declared by the minister at the time that the NBN, for this purpose, was complete. But then steps 2, 3, 4 and 5 are, in my understanding, nowhere near happening. The first one of these incomplete steps is that the Productivity Commission would need to be requested to conduct a 12-month inquiry. The next step would be that we would then have a parliamentary joint committee to consider the Productivity Commission's 12-month inquiry report. It would then need to be declared ready for sale, and, ultimately, there would need to be a decision of both houses of the parliament for this to go ahead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This framework has been in place, as I said, for 14 years. The framework has been the same for 14 years. Nothing's changed since the Prime Minister first walked in here in November 2010 and introduced this legislation. There has been absolutely no mention of this from the coalition. There's been no suggestion of a sale. There's been no suggestion of a change in the approach to the sale. What we've been doing as a coalition is remaining firmly focused on the things that matter to Australians, and this stunt, quite frankly, is not one of those things. Perhaps it's the ghosts of Labor governments past that they're trying to save this sale from—that somehow the then Prime Minister concocted some sort of landmine that the Prime Minister's now going to step on 14 years later.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is all complete and utter nonsense. I think what's more likely—from having seen the Labor Party in operation over many years—is we're going to see a corflute campaign at the next election. Make no mistake, there is nothing that Labor love better than a policy that they can fit onto a corflute. I'm wondering what these corflutes are going to say. Maybe one of them will say 'Keep the NBN in public hands'. Maybe another will say 'Cheaper internet'.</span>

                    </a>  I love the enthusiasm shown by the member for Lingiari, because her engagement on this issue would actually suggest to me that, having recently seen the successful election of the CLP in the Northern Territory, where the Labor government utterly failed on a number of fronts, she knows exactly what I mean about how the Labor Party will run the next federal campaign. It will all fit on either a postage stamp or the back of a coaster, but, more likely, it will fit on a corflute. This Labor government thinks it can create some kind of distraction, and the Prime Minister thought he could distract Australians away from their troubles. But now it's grown into something else. As I said, the member for Richmond is talking about how great the tower coverage is, and that gives them a reason to talk about it. That's fantastic. But it's a distraction from the issues that are important to Australians. The government think that by creating a shiny bauble over here about the public ownership of the NBN, when they're having an entire <span style="font-style:italic;">Seinfeld</span> episode of their own about whether it can or can't be sold or will or won't be sold, Australians are not going to focus on the government's failures when they're casting their ballot at the next election. Unfortunately for this Labor government, it severely underestimates what Australians know is going on in their household budgets.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This NBN sham of a bill is actually the last thing that Australians are thinking about right now. They want relief from their hip pocket; they want relief from cost-of-living pressures. They want to see their mortgage payments going down. None of those things are done by a government who is too busy chasing the corflute headline.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="295588" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GARLAND</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:15</span>):  By his own admission, the previous speaker spoke for 15 minutes about nothing, and I tend to agree with him. I'll just make a couple of observations here, on the National Broadband Network Companies Amendment (Commitment to Public Ownership) Bill. The first is that this bill cannot be an unimportant piece of legislation or just a distraction—they say we shouldn't be interested in it—when it is already so significant that the opposition have made the decision to vote against safeguarding the NBN. It's really up to those opposite to explain what their position is and why they don't want to safeguard the NBN. It is also up to those opposite to explain why, for the issues they profess to care about, such as reducing the cost of living, they are so determined to vote against measures like fee-free TAFE or housing legislation or debt relief for students. I am experiencing a bit of confusion right now, I'll be honest, given the contribution of the previous speaker. It would be really valuable to understand if they think this bill is so unimportant that they are going to dismiss it or if it is so important that they are determined to oppose it and vote against it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I invite those opposite to work with us to safeguard the NBN and to commit to the cost-of-living relief measures that our government has sensibly put forward. It is really important to show bipartisan support for cost-of-living relief. People and communities across Australia would love to see that. That invitation is an open one to those opposite to support our sensible measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason this is such an important bill to have before the House is that we know Labor is the party that had the vision to put the NBN forward and to implement a national broadband network for this country. That network would mean that people in our communities could be connected and would have world-class internet access. Unfortunately, we saw that undermined and compromised when the coalition came to power in 2013. That is why we want to make sure that, while we are in government, we take the opportunity to safeguard the very important national asset that is the National Broadband Network.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, we've seen too often the tendency of those opposite to cut and gut public assets. I'm from Victoria, where we still have a long memory of the legacy of Jeff Kennett and what his state government did to our state. Schools closed, and we are now having to reopen public schools right across the state as a result of the fact that they did not respect and did not treat with due regard the public sector and public assets like schools, like hospitals and like so many other important public services. We know, unfortunately, that it does seem to be in the DNA of those opposite to cut public services and to privatise the assets and utilities that are probably best served by being in public hands. That's why we're putting forward this bill today—to amend the National Broadband Network Companies Act 2011 to ensure ongoing public ownership of the NBN. This bill is going to make it really clear to Australian people that we have a deep, deep commitment to the ongoing sustainability and efficiency of the NBN and we want to keep it in public hands. We've supported strong regulatory oversight already, and we've already settled a special access undertaking with the ACCC to cap wholesale prices. We're really worried about what those opposite might do if they ever—and I'm worried about this—got access to this side of the House and sat on these benches because we know that not only do they like to reduce services and cut costs in ways that have detrimental effects on our communities but they also like to sell off public assets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are absolutely committed to keeping the NBN in public hands. We are incorporating new wording into the existing act to make clear that the preservation of the NBN in public ownership is an explicit requirement, removing provisions in the act relating to the NBN Co sale scheme. We strongly believe that the NBN needs to stay in full government ownership to support the ongoing upgrade of the network and ensure ongoing regulatory oversight of NBN wholesale pricing, keeping broadband affordable for all Australians. We know how important the NBN is for connectivity. I think most of us could not imagine our lives without being online and being able to have easy and affordable access to the internet. It is vital for all parts of our lives, whether it be work, whether it be education, whether it be leisure or whether it be keeping in contact with loved ones. So we know that we need to be a responsible government and safeguard and protect this important public asset. We made our commitment clear in the updated statement of expectations in 2022 that the NBN needs to stay in government hands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Government ownership is essential to deliver the strategy for a more connected Australia, including rolling out more fibre in the fixed line network, planning for the transition to next-generation satellites and modernising universal service obligations. I think the other thing that's really important to understand and remember here is that the internet and the NBN are evolving all the time as technology evolves, and so it will be best delivered through government where we're able to have that flexibility and those obligations for services to our communities to upgrade the system appropriately. This is crucial national infrastructure with cybersecurity and national security imperatives too, which absolutely—and I'd hope that both sides of the House can agree on this—require strong government oversight to ensure that we protect national and cybersecurity requirements. This is best delivered through ongoing government ownership. Any future sale of the NBN would likely involve foreign ownership, which raises potentially serious national sovereignty and security risks, and I'd urge those opposite to be mindful of those.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The former coalition government had taken the initial legislative steps to prepare the NBN for sale, which is quite worrying, especially in the context of what I've just described in relation to national security, including declaring the network built and fully operational in 2020. The coalition also supported an NBN submission to increase wholesale prices on their core product by three per cent and to bolster their income streams in preparation for sale. This was ultimately rejected by Labor and rejected by the ACCC. I mentioned earlier the memory of some of us—and my memories in Victoria—in terms of coalition governments selling off public assets. Of course, who can forget the sale of Telstra under the Howard government? This is a prime example of the coalition making promises on prices and services for telecommunications that were not delivered. The sale of Telstra also deprived the government of leverage to roll out fibre broadband in Australia, necessitating the Rudd government's establishment of the NBN in the first place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government has been consulting on regional telecommunications services and has received feedback from communities, particularly in rural and regional Australia, that there is strong support for the NBN network to stay in government ownership. We know that keeping the NBN in public ownership is absolutely essential to continue to provide modern, accessible and affordable communication services for all Australians, no matter where they live.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would hope that those opposite can recognise the importance of giving the public assurances about the future of the NBN. I hope that those opposite can recognise the importance in relation to cybersecurity and national security of ensuring the NBN remains in government hands. I'm really pleased to commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:25</span>):  Yet another political stunt by this desperate Albanese Labor government. As usual, there is absolutely no real consideration of the issues which are having such an impact on regional Australians. I know Labor neither understands nor, worse, cares about those Australians who live over the sandstone curtain, the Great Dividing Range. How about this government do something different for a change? How about this government focus on improving regional phone connectivity? They'll say, 'But we are.' But when they brought out their election promise of the so-called improving connectivity round—and it was an election promise—all the upgrades to the existing mobile phone towers went to Labor Party seats. They came in here and they said: 'We will have transparency and integrity. There will be no pork-barrelling under us.' Well, shame on them because the colour-coded spreadsheets—at least ours had a bit of colour, but theirs were all red when it came to upgrading mobile phone towers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Residents are rightly concerned. Just two months ago I spoke both locally back in my Riverina electorate and in this place about the issue of mobile connectivity affecting residents in and around Ardlethan and Kamarah. They're not big towns but they're very important agricultural entities and districts. Ardlethan had a tin mine which flourished for many years until the world price of that commodity dropped through the floor. They are big wheat growing areas and sheep producing areas. Residents there shouldn't have to climb the nearest wheat silo to get coverage, to get reception, to get at least one bar on their mobile phone, particularly during harvest and particularly if there's a medical emergency. That is just not right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Farmers these days expect better, farmers demand better and farmers deserve better. Particularly since we had the deregulation of the wheat industry, farmers need their mobiles whilst they're up the paddock, whilst they're on the chaser bins, whilst they're on the header and whilst they're stripping their crops to be able to sell those crops, that grain. Once upon a time you took it to the silo and the wheat board took care of it, and you got the price depending on the hard wheat or whatever quality and quantity you produced. Not these days—you can actually sell the wheat; there's a huge market for it. But you can't sell it if you can't get mobile coverage. Farmers tend to sometimes lose tens of thousands of dollars simply because they can't get the right price at the right time because they've got no damn coverage. It's just not good enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government comes in here with legislation that is not going to fix the farmers left in the Kamarah district. I know that Telstra is working closely with the farmers and I appreciate the efforts to which the southern regional manager, Chris Taylor, is going to help them. I know there's been a delay in that, and I know that Telstra and Mr Taylor have been upfront with the residents. But it's incumbent upon this government to show a little bit of care and concern over those issues affecting those regional people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the benefits of bringing mobile phone connectivity—and I appreciate this is about broadband, but it's all about data and having connections to the rest of the world—and how much the benefits bring to areas. I remember unveiling a tower in Goobarragandra, in the Tumut snowy valleys, and I know how pleased Tony Keremelevski was. He said that will actually save lives and he fought so hard for the benefits it brought to a little place called Murringo in the Young district of the Hilltops Council area. The number of small businesses run by women in that area who were going to be connected to the world because of the connection that we provided through the mobile phone tower at Murringo—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  I take the opportunity today to reflect on the crash of the US Marine Corps B-22 Osprey aircraft that took place at Melville Island on 27 August last year, killing three United States marines and injuring 20 others. There were more than 2,500 troops from the United States, Australia, Philippines, Timor-Leste and Indonesia participating at the time in an exercise on the Tiwi Islands as part of Predators Run 2023. To mark the anniversary of this accident, three traditional ceremonies were conducted in Darwin and on the Tiwi Islands, hosted by the Tiwi Islands' Mantiyupwi clan in collaboration with the Larrakia Nation Aboriginal Corporation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 24 September, a spiritual walk including smoking ceremonies took place at several locations, including Robertson Barracks, Defence Establishment Berrima, the Royal Australian Air Force Darwin base and the Larrakeyah Defence Precinct. This was followed by a healing ceremony on 26 September on Larrakia country at Cullen Bay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 27 September, US marines, all the families of the fallen and the Australian Defence Force members travelled to the crash site at Pickertaramoor, Melville Island, for a historic pukumani ceremony. The pukumani ceremony marked the end of a one-year-and-one-month mourning period. This private event is steeped in Tiwi culture and tradition to honour the deceased and help guide their spirits to the afterlife. These events honoured the lives of those marines who were tragically lost on this fateful day in 2023, with traditional Tiwi rituals intended to help guide their spirits on the next journey. The Tiwi people, in keeping with their traditions, referred to the fallen marine as having gone to sleep, honouring 'Big Brother', which was Major Tobin Lewis; 'Little Sister', Captain Eleanor LeBeau; and 'Little Brother', Corporal Spencer Collart, through three traditional ceremonies symbolising the deep bond between the Tiwi people and the US Marine Corps.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I join with the Minister for Indigenous Australians, who spoke at the pukumani ceremony, in extending my heartfelt condolences to the families of those marines and the entire military community who have been impacted by this terribly sad incident. I also express my gratitude to the Tiwi first responders, including the Tiwi Rangers, who were amongst the first to offer help 12 months ago. I echo the sentiments of Mantiyupwi traditional owner Jennifer Ullungura Clancy in acknowledging the responsibility that Tiwi people felt and to make sure the families and the visitors were safe and looked after while on country. As Jennifer reminds us, following this tragic event that took place on Mantiyupwi land in August last year, the US Marines and the Defence Force are now part of our Tiwi family. The pukumani ceremony was an opportunity for grieving families and friends, Tiwi brothers and sisters, to heal and move forward with their lives. For Tiwi elders, the three US marines that passed away in the crash will always be a part of us and will never be forgotten. The sad events that happened on Tiwi country have connected the families as forever part of our Tiwi culture and history. The healing and the pukumani rituals have marked the final chapter in the journey of Big Brother, Little Sister and Little Brother. May their spirits rest in peace.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="260805" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HASTIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:34</span>):  Tonight I want to talk about defence recruiting. It's in a really bad state. In fact, reports I hear are that it is in a diabolical state. But tonight I want to start with my own experience, which was 22 years ago, and I thought it was an isolated incident.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I applied for the ADF 22 years ago. My paperwork was lost and I had issues with recruiting. I had some family friends who were serving in the ADF—one was a brigadier, another a major-general. They both had to intervene to get my paperwork going. Once I was in the ADF, there were more issues to do with my basic training. I remember the moment when I was so fed up that I said to the officer in charge, 'I'm going to go to Mr Anthony Albanese,' who was my member of parliament at the time. I'll tell you what, I've never seen any paperwork move so quickly as I did in that instance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, looking back 22 years, I thought we would have fixed all of these problems, but the reports that I've received and the reports that my colleagues have received show our ADF recruiting to be in a terrible state. We're losing good people. We're losing young Australians who are keen to serve their country but can't get through the door because of a whole range of administrative bungles. The system is not working and it needs fixing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Defence, again, is proving itself to be part of the problem. Back in June, during estimates, questions were put about the personnel requirement for the ADF. The number was at 63,597 and there was a shortfall reported of 5,313. Just this month the <span style="font-style:italic;">2024 </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Defence </span><span style="font-style:italic;">w</span><span style="font-style:italic;">orkforce </span><span style="font-style:italic;">p</span><span style="font-style:italic;">lan</span> was released, and 2½ years after the Albanese government won the election—it's taken 2½ years to get a defence workforce plan—the government has revised down the personnel targets in the ADF to 58,650, which has now reduced the shortfall by 1,624. They've lowered the standards of recruiting to reduce that shortfall, and it's unacceptable. This is while the country has grown in the last 2½ years by 1.4 million people. So the ADF is shrinking as our general population is growing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But tonight I want to give voice to the young Australians who have had all sorts of trouble with ADF recruiting. I think of Alan from Wheatbelt in Western Australia who says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I have seen your posts about ADF recruiting and have had a dismal experience with both of my children trying to enlist for up to 2 years now. The experience has been abysmal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alan's son was due to attend his enlistment last Tuesday morning at 7.30 am; however, he was advised at 2.30 pm the afternoon before that he was no longer able to attend because Defence Force recruiting couldn't get hold of the person who processed his security clearance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Faith from Perth, who was home-schooled and met all the requirements—she completed her OLNA test, her SAT test and her years 11 and 12 at TAFE—attempted to get a position with the ADF Gap Year program, and she was denied. She says: 'My ADF case manager has been struggling to convince her supervisor I qualify for the Gap Year despite my competence.' Aidan from Victoria says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">My career goal is to become a Defence Helicopter Pilot and I had recently completed testing with ADF recruitment which I had successfully unlocked Naval Helicopter Pilot. However, I disclosed in my medical application that I had used an asthma inhaler once four years ago. Unfortunately, this disclosure meant my application was rejected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was despite him appealing the decision and demonstrating that he no longer suffered from asthma. This is a kid who has strong academic results, having achieved dux of systems engineering for 2023 with a predicted ATAR of 90.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I could go on. Tiana from Queensland has had similar issues. She says she is 'starting to consider other employment options' and 'just wants to know whether she has been accepted or not'. And Joshua from New South Wales has been attempting to apply to the ADF since April 2022. He scored a high result in the aptitude test and unlocked almost every job within Defence. He was rejected by medical teams, without review by a doctor, for having a history of anxiety disorder during adolescence, which is more and more common with young Australians these days.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The point in all of this is that we are letting down young Australians who are keen to wear our uniform, to put a flag on their shoulder and defend our country. Because of the quality of ADF recruiting, which has been outsourced—first to Manpower and now to Adecco—we are letting young Australians go on by, and they're finding careers elsewhere. We can't afford to do this, especially when we already have a recruiting and retention crisis in the ADF. We will fix it if we win government next year.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:39</span>):  I rise to celebrate three fantastic achievements all linked to the world-leading University of Newcastle. Speaker, if I asked you, 'What do Coldplay and the University of Newcastle have in common,' what would you say? You might be forgiven for having to take a moment to ponder that one, during which I would jump in to say, 'They both have a love of renewable energy, solar energy in particular, and they're both known for their love of innovation.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">British rock legends Coldplay are known for their innovative music and electrifying live performances, and they reached out to Newcastle's Kardinia Energy, who have pioneered the printing of solar panels, to install 500 square metres of printed solar panels for their shows. Invented by the University of Newcastle's Professor Paul Dastoor, the solar panels were placed in the seats behind the stage and elsewhere around the venue to collect power in battery packs that were then used to power the C stage and to fulfil other power needs throughout the venue. The University of Newcastle has partnered with Kardinia Energy to develop this technology which is ultralightweight, ultraflexible, totally recyclable and cheap to manufacture. It's similar in thickness and appearance to a chip packet, and it's manufactured using conventional printers. I am so proud of the world-leading research being undertaken at the University of Newcastle, and it's so great to see their efforts recognised by Coldplay and now the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Continuing on with the concept of innovation, Dr Stuart McBratney from the University of Newcastle is about to host the screening of his new feature film, <span style="font-style:italic;">Strangers in a Car Park</span>. The film tells a story of a cleaner working backstage at an awards show who unexpectedly recognises the medallist as her assailant. The story is set primarily in a single location in one night, a concrete car park at the University of Newcastle, where Dr McBratney works as a lecturer. Dr McBratney specialises in simple production methods to produce his masterpieces. Multiple times over, he has demonstrated how the process of making a full-length feature film from conception to production and distribution can be achieved for a reasonable price. This method has been giving Australian actors and filmmakers the opportunity to work on feature films that might otherwise be out of reach. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

This included students enrolled in a variety of programs, including media and communications, law, psychology and business. Congratulations to Dr Stuart McBratney and the team. I am wishing you all the very best for the screening of <span style="font-style:italic;">Strangers </span><span style="font-style:italic;">in </span><span style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Car Park</span> this coming Sunday at the Conservatorium of Music in Newcastle.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Stories of Our Town is a series of documentary films that tell the history of Newcastle through the eyes and points of views of Novocastrians who are there. This is an additional project, and these films are produced by Glenn Easton Dormand, also known as Chit Chat Von Loopin Stab, and Tony Whittaker of Carnivore Films. Everything from the story of BHP, the famous Star Hotel riot and our military history to how Newcastle Harbour was once the most dangerous for shipping—they're just some of the stories recounted across 12 extraordinary films. These efforts are possible because of the great partnerships between local filmmakers, the University of Newcastle and Newcastle's major cultural institutions and communities organisations. Stories of Our Town's latest film, <span style="font-style:italic;">Shipwrecked</span>, tells the story of hundreds of shipwrecks in and around Newcastle Harbour has been screened all over Newcastle and the Hunter, and is now available on YouTube. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr John Di Gravio OAM, who wears many hats in Newcastle, reached out to me last week asking for my help to ensure Novocastrians and, indeed, the world can continue to enjoy these great films. Stories of Our Town currently has 3,300 subscribers on YouTube, and they need to reach 4,000 on their channel so they can attract some of YouTube's advertising revenue, thus providing them with more funds to make more films. I implore everyone to head to YouTube and subscribe to this essential viewing preserving the stories of our town, so that future generations can enjoy them just as much as we can. I salute the University of Newcastle and the creatives in the city of Newcastle for their innovation and continuous drive for a creative, exciting future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="219646" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:44</span>):  In the black summer of 2019-20, the bushfires destroyed 40 per cent of the Hyne Timber mill pine feedstock. Now, for many companies, they might just pack up and leave, but not Hyne. This company was established in 1882. It's one of Australia's largest softwood manufacturing companies. It has a commitment to the Tumbarumba region that is second to none. I commend the company. It employs more than a thousand people at the Tumbarumba sawmill. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Tuesday, the Hyne company opened its new 4,700-square-metre storage facility. That's going to enable the timber that was once sitting out in the open, getting weathered, to be under cover. This is going to help prosperity. It's going to help productivity—and I say bravo to this company. Its CEO, Jim Bindon, was there. The newly elected mayor of Snowy Valleys, Julia Ham, was present last Tuesday at the very auspicious opening, as was the executive officer of the Softwoods Working Group, Carlie Porteous, who also serves as the Murray region forestry group's hub manager. You could see the excitement in the eyes of the employees, because they knew that this was securing their future. But, more than that, it secures Tumbarumba's future and the area around Tumbarumba—indeed, you could argue, the council local government area—where 70 per cent of its gross product, its gross shire product, is underpinned by timber. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know timber is a dirty word in Victoria amongst some of our Labor colleagues. But I have to say that the former coalition government implemented the Forestry Recovery Development Fund Program. I also want to put on record that the work with the timber industry by the former member for Hunter, Joel Fitzgibbon, has been fantastic. It has been amazing, and I commend him for that. But, under this fund—as well as from the former New South Wales government—Hyne Timber was successful in securing finance to help optimise the mill for improved efficiency, with fewer logs. It built this storage facility. It's going to help protect the timber that's been kiln-dried from the weather before it is planed in the dry mill to build the next generation's new homes. And we need new homes. If we're going to keep increasing the population with the migrants coming in, with their numbers at present, we are going to need to build new homes, and governments have to get around this thought about timber. Indeed, it's a great sink for our future. A great clean, green, environmental outcome is actually having timber in your homes. You can't build them all out of steel, particularly with the price of power at the moment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This new storage facility is going to make such a difference. Throughout its construction, 30 local jobs were created and more than $5 million was injected into the region's economy. That might not sound like much to people in here when we talk about billions of dollars for infrastructure upgrades and projects and programs, but I tell you what: for a community the size of Tumbarumba, it means everything. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hyne contracted Joss Group of Albury to complete the project. It's just down the road. It's a good local company. Hyne has a long-lasting and clearly demonstrated history of investing in the local community. I can remember one of my very first visits as the National Party candidate, and then as the National Party member for Riverina. I was taken to Hyne. I went there with no less than Warren Truss, a former member for Wide Bay. I know that Hyne's got a big financial commitment in that electorate as well. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But Hyne established the Hyne Community Trust too, and I just want to talk about that. It was established in 2007. Nearly $800,000 has been distributed to community groups and good causes in the Tumbarumba region from this charitable trust that this great company has put forward. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So well done to Mr Bindon and well done to Hyne Timber. Like I said, it has been going since 1882. It's had a commitment to the Tumbarumba sawmill since 2001. It provides good charity. It provides good jobs. It provides a good future for Tumbarumba. I say: well done to Hyne, and may your new storage shed bring about every success that you planned it to have. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:54</span>):  When I've been speaking to people out in the community of Penrith, St Marys, Luddenham, all across Lindsay, and speaking to small businesses this last week, there has been a common theme. You ask, 'How you are going?' and arms get thrown up in the air. The top issue, of course, is the cost of living and people are just so annoyed about the broken promises of the Albanese Labor government, particularly on the cost of living and those cheaper mortgages that were promised. We have seen rate rise after rate rise, causing so many Western Sydney families to struggle. Families are under pressure when it comes to housing, whether it be their mortgages or whether they are looking for homes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The commitment to the Morrison government's infrastructure pipeline was cut by the infrastructure minister and then repackaged. Western Sydney residents were given back the repackaged commitment, which was less money—and we were all expected to be grateful for less money. The current commitment is nowhere near enough for a growing population with the Western Sydney International Airport just around the corner. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is one figure, though, that is etched into the minds of everyday Australians in the suburbs of Western Sydney, and that is $275. The Prime Minister, before the election, promised almost 100 times that energy bills would be lowered by $275. But they've gone up a tremendous amount. In Western Sydney, households are paying more than $1,000 above what the Prime Minister promised when he said they'd be paying $275 less. It's extraordinary. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A gym in Penrith is paying double for its energy bill. A cafe tells me that they're struggling to keep their doors open, particularly because of the cost of energy. We've got food banks not only feeding families with double incomes but also paying for their electricity bills. For us, this isn't good enough. It's certainly not good enough for me, being the local member for Lindsay. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reckless renewables-only approach of the Minister for Climate Change and Energy is causing so much damage to families and small businesses. I've been speaking to manufacturers across Western Sydney, and they're not happy with the Albanese Labor government. Do you know what they need? They need gas. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We spoke with brickworks recently, at Austral Bricks, and they need gas to make bricks. Pandrol Australia in Blacktown needs gas to make railway parts, and I know they are so worried about not being able to be part of our sovereign capability—our supply chain—of making Aussie made in this country. Mascot Steel Fabrication in Emu Plains needs gas to fabricate steel. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition is committed to gas being part of the Capacity Investment Scheme, and we need gas projects approved and basins unlocked to get the economy moving again. More supply will help bring prices down so our manufacturers can make things in Australia and our households on double incomes don't have to line up at those food banks and get their electricity bills paid for them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the $275 figure isn't scaring people off enough, there are more concerning numbers that have been released over just this last week. The Frontier Economics report demonstrates the government has not been straight with the Australian people. We now know Labor said that utility scale generation, storage and transmission would cost $122 billion, but the real number that they haven't told Australians is $642 billion. They are only off by a whopping half a trillion dollars. The concerning thing is that that big figure translates to a figure that every single Australian in the national electricity market will need to pay: $59,000 per household. That is $59,000 that people will be worse off. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the cost of people's mortgages and the broken promise on infrastructure projects that were ripped away and then repackaged with an expectation that everyone would be grateful—even though they were getting less—and when it comes to the broken promise of the $275, Australians are asking a lot of questions and, in Western Sydney, they are certainly feeling very let down by this Albanese Labor government. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:32</span>):  The Mount Isa rodeo is in very serious trouble. I have absolutely no idea how it ended up being run by a public servant in Brisbane and a lady in Townsville. They tell me they're quite nice ladies. I don't denigrate them, but I don't know how anyone can run a rodeo when they've never really been on a horse much—and one lives in Brisbane and the other in Townsville. It's not really surprising.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Curry Merry Muster is still going very strong, in the neighbouring town of Cloncurry. It was the first rodeo in the area, and the second biggest rodeo in Queensland for a long time. It was founded by my father. He was President of the ARRO, the Australian Rough Riders Association. He wasn't a roughrider himself, but he was very active in rodeoing. As a little kid, I had to run the water over, because they built all of the chutes and grounds themselves. That was the spirit of rodeo. You had 12 or 15 blokes carrying all the big logs, putting them together and building the rodeo grounds, and I had to run the water over from our house, which was about 400 metres away, to all the workers. This is my father's song:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the spirit of rodeo. I worked at the bar. I wanted to watch the fights, and the bar had steel protection, so I was protected. A big mob would come down from Doomadgee and they'd get into fights. Vern Daisy, a very famous rugby league player, would be there enjoying it. It was a great atmosphere, with big trees and shade. I'd talk to all my mates. There was Kenny Coleman, who I'd see every year—the greatest roughrider in Australian history; Grant Lillyman—one of the most prominent families the mid-west has ever produced; and Ronny Purse, my best mate—we had half a million acres together, the pair of us. I would run into all these people; I'd see them. It was a shady area, very well set out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we just have a barren brick wall and nothing—not a tree, not an ounce of shade cover. No-one can drink at the bar and talk about old times; no-one wants to, because of the incredible heat and barrenness. If you had anything to do with the town, you would know that. You would know that you need trees and maybe a shade shed there. You would know that. My son, Robbie Katter, the state member of parliament, lives in Mount Isa. My family has lived in the Mount Isa-Cloncurry area for about 120 or 130 years now. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="276714" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DAVID SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bean</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:35</span>):  Menslink has been supporting young men in the Canberra region for over 20 years through free counselling, volunteer mentoring and education programs. In that time, it has helped thousands of young men get through tough or lonely times. It helps young men reach their full potential and become the great adult men they want to be. Menslink believes everything is possible for them, their families, their mates and our community. Services are provided at no cost and are available to all young men aged 10 to 25 in Canberra and the surrounding region. Menslink's sister organisation, Fearless Women, was set up recently to provide equivalent services to young women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to update the chamber on a fantastic activity which I was able to participate in last week, in support of Menslink and its goals. The Menslink Great Walk, which is now in its fourth year, was a huge success, not only raising funds for this fantastic organisation but also raising its profile and the availability of its services to the Canberra region. Journeying across our nation's capital, the five-day adventure is one of those unforgettable, epic adventures. At 142 kilometres, this trail is longer than the Kokoda Track and further than the distance to the Everest base camp. It gave all the participants—including me—a fresh perspective on our home town of Canberra. Starting at Parliament House on the morning of Tuesday 12 November 2024, we walked up to 30 kilometres per day along the Canberra Centenary Trail.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The challenge of the walk is not just the distance. Walkers raise significant funds for the cause as well, and those contributions go directly to Menslink to support its programs, which support young men and their families in the Canberra community though volunteer mentoring, counselling, and school and workplace programs. Each year, it costs over $1,800 to support one young man through counselling, mentoring and school programs. Every dollar raised is an important part of funding that effort. The programs help improve mental fitness, combat domestic violence, reduce youth suicide, increase respect and positive behaviours, and create stronger communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to thank Menslink Chair Michael Battenally, the board, CEO Ben Gathercole, and all the crew at Menslink for the work they do each and every day and all their efforts for this year's Menslink Great Walk event. I'd also like to acknowledge the contribution of all the walkers and their supporters. I want to give a shout-out to the sponsors as well: Threesides Marketing, Southside Physio, PSC Insurance Brokers, Geocon, Workin' Gear and Region Media. Thank you to all the other contributors for your support of the walkers and, through them, the families and young men that Menslink helps every day.</span>

Well done. On behalf of the people of Fisher, I want to say congratulations to all of those businesses, who consistently represent the best of the best on the Sunshine Coast. I'm proud to be the member for Fisher, which is said to be the small business capital of the country. I want to thank them all for their work and congratulate all of the award winners.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PHILLIPS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:41</span>):  In my electorate of Gilmore, which is home to HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span style="font-style:italic;">lbatross</span>, the Fleet Air Arm and HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Creswell</span>, defence and defence industry is pivotal. Last week I hosted Richard Marles, the Acting Prime Minister and Minister for Defence, providing a huge opportunity for him to understand the scale of operations in our region and to see for himself the skill and dedication of our defence members on the south coast of New South Wales. With more than 7,500 serving defence members, veterans and their families in my electorate, defence is highly important to people here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to particularly thank the early educators at One Tree Defence Childcare Unit Tingira, who we visited. They do magnificent work supporting our young ones for our defence families. We made a visit to the MCCI Italian seniors group in Nowra, a valuable networking group that comes together over traditional Italian food, friendship and activities, and we were even treated to Stella's opera singing. We met with electrical and carpentry students at TAFE to see how our fee-free TAFE is making a difference, and it is. It is great to see these classes booming, and now we are making fee-free TAFE permanent because we need more tradies to build more homes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Acting Prime Minister also confirmed that, while the previous chopper on a stick could not be revived, there would be a new replacement helicopter, because we know how important it is to show at our gateway to Nowra that we are a proud Navy and defence town. Members of Special Operations Command's Australian Defence Force Parachuting School gave us a super display of different ADF parachuting techniques, showing how important ADF parachuting is for defence capability for our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We visited the fine defence members and staff at HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Albatross</span>, including 723 Squadron, which does initial helicopter training for both Navy and Army. We met with avionics maintainers that maintain the MH-60R Seahawk Romeo helicopters. We went to the Romeo squadrons and even popped in a Seahawk Romeo simulator to witness firsthand the fine training our pilots and crews undertake to be prepared for any situation. HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Albatross </span>is growing. It is currently receiving a $125 million airport and infrastructure upgrade, and soon there will be a further $140 million in infrastructure works to support new and additional Seahawk Romeo helicopters. This will include a new squadron, simulator and associated infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you to everyone involved with this visit. The minister took his time to talk with defence members, and defence members asked great questions. You could see the learning taking place. I certainly look forward to a bright future for HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Albatross</span>. If you're a local or from anywhere around Australia, consider a career in the Defence Force today.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILLCOX</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:44</span>):  If you're lucky in life, you'll get old, grey and good looking—a bit like me! I was scheduled to speak on the Aged Care Bill 2024, before it was guillotined. However, I wanted to ensure that my constituents of Dawson know that ageing gracefully and with dignity is important to me. When you have worked hard your entire life, it is only fair that the government provide assistance in your golden years. We need to ensure that any legislation promotes dignity and independence, values elders in our society and is strong and sustainable for the future generations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In good faith, the coalition worked to ensure that the government's reforms suited regional and rural Australia, not just those in the big cities. The coalition pushed the Labor government to include grandfathering arrangements, lifetime caps, a much lower taper rate and an assurance that the federal government will remain the priority funder of aged care—not the consumer. The introduction of the grandfathering arrangements into this legislation is most critical. This guarantees that Australians who are already in residential aged care or on a home-care package, or are waiting for an allocated home-care package, will not see any changes to their existing arrangements. This means any Australian who is currently in the aged-care system will not pay one cent more. Another vital component was a lifetime cap. This means that the maximum contribution payable is fixed, providing families with peace of mind. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to come from a rural and regional area, but unfortunately this also has come with its issues. That is why the coalition negotiated with the government to secure an additional investment of $300 million in capital funding for regional, rural and remote aged-care providers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While there have been significant achievements made by the coalition on this bill, it is important to remember that this is Labor's package of reforms. This bill was not co-designed with the coalition. In this bill, this Labor government has failed to address critical issues such as workforce, regulatory impacts and implementation timelines. Last year alone, 49 aged-care homes closed under the Albanese Labor government. This bill cannot force the closure of more homes. We want Australians to live their life with dignity. The coalition has fought, and always will fight, for elderly Australians who live in rural and regional areas. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hawke</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:47</span>):  Patricia Mary Dorothy Clegg, affectionately known to us all as Pat, was a remarkable woman whose presence will be deeply missed. Born on 13 August 1933, Pat passed away peacefully on 16 August 2024. Pat and her beloved husband, Arthur, raised three wonderful children in the community—Christine, Malcolm and Elizabeth—and she was a devoted grandmother to her eight grandchildren. Pat cherished her family deeply, and they adored her in return. She instilled in them her courage of conviction, always encouraging them to stand strong in their beliefs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A matriarch of the Bacchus Marsh branch of the Australian Labor Party, Pat was a formidable force, a strong woman who was unwavering in her belief in a just and fair society. She was well versed in the issues of the day and always ready to discuss, or perhaps even vigorously debate, her views with anyone who thought differently. Pat was passionate about the things she loved: first and foremost her family; and then, in no particular order, clothes; her beloved Richmond Tigers; and politics. She and Arthur were generous and gracious hosts. Their door was always open, the kettle always on, for a cuppa and a chat. There was no judgement from Pat, just an occasional knowing nod and perhaps a cheeky smile.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Pat was a true believer, and her legacy lives on in her children and all those who were fortunate enough to know her. It was my great privilege to attend her service, a final farewell to a woman who has left a lasting impression on our community and all who had the honour of calling her a friend. My condolences go to Chris and all the family. Vale, Pat Clegg.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Paarhammer Windows and Doors is a shining example of the innovation and talent in my electorate of Hawke. This remarkable family business has grown from humble beginnings in Ballan to setting the gold standard in energy-efficient products across the nation. Since 1990, Edith and Tony Paarhammer have worked tirelessly to deliver sustainable, high-quality products to clients across Australia. Their dedication and craftsmanship have made them industry leaders. Recently, Paarhammer Windows and Doors were recognised for four prestigious awards, two national, one Victorian and one from New South Wales. These accolades are a testament to their excellence, but awards alone do not tell the whole story. The Paarhammers are not just good business people; they are a generous and community minded family. Now joined by their son, Thomas, the Paarhammer's legacy is set to continue, ensuring this remarkable business will remain a cornerstone of our local economy for years to come. I congratulate the Paarhammer family on their incredible success.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, in both our state and federal government, ministerial diary disclosure laws should be introduced to allow the public to see who politicians are meeting with, who's concerns they really care about, and who's voices have most influence over bills being developed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, we must ensure that people aren't needlessly left out of our democracy. Currently, prisoners serving three years or more are barred from voting, and despite overwhelming campaigning, sixteen and seventeen year-olds are still denied a vote.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In the space of 10 years, these changes would demonstrate a commitment to all Tasmanians, by ensuring we are empowered, educated and represented. Politics should reflect all voices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Volunteering for charities has changed my life. Far from giving up my time, these organisations have given so much back to me, and in 10 years, I'd love to see more young people involved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">At Salvos Stores Launceston, I built my interpersonal skills in a supportive team. These soft skills make young people more employable and confident.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, youth often feel powerless about the problems in their communities. When I started volunteering, my mental health improved significantly with a direct way to help.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Lastly, volunteering also bridges age, cultural and socio-economic divides. Engaging with people in need makes our youth better informed, empathetic and motivated by others' struggles. In this way, volunteering has set me up for a lifetime of changemaking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">However, youth volunteers face financial, access and time pressures. These could be solved by awarding TCE points for volunteering as part of senior secondary education; subsidising public service fees like transport for youth who give back to their community would reward work and easing financial pressures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">And finally, schools should promote volunteer opportunities and recognise those who give back to their communities. Tasmania needs volunteers. In 10 years, investment in volunteering would help both our communities and youth thrive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks for your contribution, Erin. It's been my privilege to share it in this place today.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:53</span>):  Recently my team and I had the pleasure of visiting a magnificent local small business in Empire Bay named Sorrento Pizzeria. Sorrento Pizzeria is owned by the friendly Mr Elia 'Luigi' Eliopoulou and produces exquisite-tasting authentic pizzas. Elia is incredibly passionate about his Italian ancestry as well as his grandmother's pizza recipes, which originated from Naples and are over 100 years old. Elia uses these recipes at Sorrento Pizzeria and they are why his customers keep going back for more. I can wholeheartedly say that I have not had pizzas that have tasted so good elsewhere. While my team and I were enjoying our pizzas, he explained his intriguing family history. His grandmother grew up in Naples and began the family tradition more than 100 years ago by learning how to bake bread and how to make pizzas. This tradition and the recipes were passed down to his mother and, after, his family immigrated to Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Elia has fond memories of growing up in Marrickville in Sydney, enjoying these pizza recipes every Friday night after school. Fast forward to today and he is keeping with the family tradition and keeping the recipes alive through his exceptional Sorrento Pizzeria. He is often supported around the restaurant by his young children, Sophie and Jack, where the pizza-making knowledge is again being passed down to the next generation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sorrento Pizzeria has also just recently been named one of nine Australian winners of the Square 50 awards facilitated by the global fintech company Square. Square 50 celebrates businesses reaching major milestones within their operations. After Square received more than 1,000 submissions from across the globe, 50 businesses were selected to be part of this year's best, which included Sorrento Pizzeria, on the mighty Central Coast in New South Wales. This remarkable achievement underscores Sorrento Pizzeria's commitment to its high-quality pizzas, outstanding customer service and authentic Italian experience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to take this opportunity to commend Mr Elia Eliopoulou on his amazing pizzeria. My team and I were blown away by your delicious pizzas and friendly staff. Congratulations on your global recognition, and thank you for being an excellent businessman and employer of young people on the Central Coast. I look forward to visiting again soon. Keep up the phenomenal work.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PASIN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:55</span>):  I rise to pay tribute to a stalwart of the Limestone Coast community, Mr Fred Lindsay Ellis, who recently passed away. A family man, a community man and a farmer, Fred Ellis was also one of the last remaining World War II veterans of the Limestone Coast. He joined the Royal Australian Navy when he was 17 and served as an able seaman on HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Cowra</span>, searching for sea mines around southern Australia, the Solomon Islands and New Guinea.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following his service, Fred married Kathleen, and after a few years they acquired a grazing block at Canunda, near Millicent, in the south-east; there they raised six children. Life on the farm presented its challenges, especially schooling for the children. Like all great Aussie farmers, Fred and Kath were resilient and innovative. They had no telephone for the first four years until they built their own line, running a mile and half across to connect to the nearest service. It took 10 years before they had a proper road to town. Rabbit control was a priority. They trapped, fumigated and ripped but also had fun spotlighting at night as a family. Family was essential to everything they did. Whether it was rabbit control, shearing, land marking or cattle work, everyone pitched in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout his life, Fred was deeply involved in the community. He contributed to public affairs, schools, sports, church activities, the Caledonian society, the lodge, the RSL and the agricultural bureau of which he was a life member. He served two terms as a Millicent district councillor in the late 1960s and early 1970s and was a justice of the peace for 30 years, retiring at the age of 80. He was the longest-serving member of the Lions Club of Millicent, with a herculean 58 years of dedication, which also earned him life membership. Fred was instrumental in the formation of the Lions Club of Keith. Fred drove his Holden Statesman—with no bull bar—to Keith every fortnight for 12 months until the club finally got up and running. Fred, as a good Methodist, reckoned God was always on his side, and he never hit a roo on the way home. In 2015, Fred was honoured to be named Millicent senior citizen of the year in recognition of his service to the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fred Ellis was a humble, generous and caring man dedicated to his family, his farm and his community. Fred's life was one of purpose and dedication. His strength, humility and kindness touched all who knew him, leaving a lasting impact. Fred's legacy continues to inspire me, as I know it does so many others in the Limestone Coast community. Vale, Fred Lindsay Ellis, </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in 2013, I was living in the United States in Florida, working for a little company called Disney. I had an experience there that really set me up for getting into politics for the rest of my life. I'd never really been that interested in politics growing up. I'm not from a political family per se. But one day I walked into the stockroom at where I was working and one of my co-workers was on the floor in literal tears. Obviously, as any normal person would do, I went up to her and asked: 'What's wrong? What's happened?' She was having to make the decision about whether she paid her rent or paid for her insulin. I remember in that moment thinking: 'I don't understand how this has happened. I don't understand how we can be working for this giant billion- or trillion-dollar company, getting paid $7 an hour, and you've been put in this position where you have to decide between fundamental health care or fundamental housing.' It's an impossible decision. We were able to rally around and raise some money for her, but I kept thinking that that was only going to help her for one month. It wasn't actually going to change the system that we were living in, where she had been put into that position. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear all these horror stories that come out of the United States about their healthcare system, and we just cannot go down that same path. Having lived it and having seen people that have lived it and been at the brutal end of that system—we cannot do that. We have to turn the ship around now before we head down that path, because universal health care is vital to Australia. Everyone deserves to have access to quality health care, including dental care and mental health care, regardless of where you live, how old you are or whatever your bank balance may be. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A properly funded universal healthcare system actually saves us money in the long run. It reduces poverty, creates jobs, drives economic growth and helps to alleviate inequality. But our healthcare system, as it stands, is starting to falter. At the same time, nearly one in three large corporations operating in Australia pay no income tax. Large corporations are able to use various offsets to be able to pay no tax while everyday Australians can't afford to go to the doctor. The system is fundamentally broken, and we are all living it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bulk-billing options are plummeting around the country. Most people with a Medicare card are unable to find a bulk-billing appointment like they used to. In my electorate of Brisbane, only a few per cent of clinics still offer bulk-billing at all, and, what's more is that finding bulk-billing appointments outside of general working hours has become almost impossible. What this means is people skipping regular health appointments, prioritising their kids' health over their own, not following up on test results or avoiding care altogether because going to the doctor has become too expensive. People are waiting until issues become critical and then presenting to emergency rooms. Those healthcare horror stories that we all judge the United States for are well on their way to becoming a reality here, so what we need to do is triple the bulk-billing incentive for everyone with a Medicare card and establish at least six free local healthcare clinics in each electorate to enable all Australians to go to the GP for free.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to a recent Black Dog Institute poll, the leading reason for Australians delaying or not seeking mental health care is the cost. Sadly, but unsurprisingly, young adults are being impacted the most. Sixty 60 per cent of those aged 18 to 24 reported that they couldn't afford to get the help they needed—more than across any other age group. In order to access mental healthcare sessions through Medicare, you need a mental healthcare plan through a GP. After the pandemic, these subsidised sessions were cut from 20 to 10 per year. That's just the subsidy; it rarely covers the full cost. Like GP visits, it has become incredibly difficult to access sessions without a gap payment. There are also extra hoops to jump through to access the final four sessions. For example, you need another GP referral, which is going to cost you more and more money. When it comes to mental health care in this country, for every person receiving treatment, at least one person is going without. We have to bring mental health care fully under Medicare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, everyone should be able to go to the dentist when they need help. Millions of Austrians are putting off going to the dentist because they can't afford it. This doesn't just lead to worse teeth; a range of other health concerns also come from that. The first thing I did after being elected to this place was go back to the dentist to get some fillings done, because I couldn't afford them while I was working in my retail job. Because I had left it so long, fillings became root canals and became exponentially more expensive. You shouldn't have to become a politician just to be able to afford to get your teeth fixed. Having healthy teeth should not be a luxury. Everyone should be able to use their Medicare card to go to the dentist. We have to bring mental health care and dental care fully into Medicare.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:07</span>):  There are parts to this motion on health care that I don't disagree with. I do agree with the underlying sentiment of the motion, which is to broaden access to core medical services. The fact that Labor introduced Medicare in the 1980s and has supported it significantly since then is the aspect of the Labor Party's legacy which I'm most proud of. I've thought about this a lot, I've written about it and I've undertaken research in relation to it. For me, it is one of the most important functions of government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where I don't agree with this motion is the extent to which it doesn't acknowledged the constraints. What it basically puts forward is an unrealistic wish list of things the mover of the motion would like to see achieved immediately. What I'm going to point out is that, in the context of what we inherited when we came to government, there has been a very significant turnaround in the underlying stability of the Medicare system, and it is one that is all the more significant given the constraints that this government has been operating under. When we came to government, we inherited from the previous government 10 years of neglect of Medicare, among other policy issues. There had been a freeze on Medicare rebates for six years. The previous government, of course, in their first horror budget, tried to introduce a co-payment. So the previous government, both through financial neglect and at times through ideological misadventure, had tried to undermine Medicare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we saw were a whole range of pressures building up. We saw pressures building such that GPs and others in the healthcare system were increasingly unable to offer bulk-billing. It is important to look at the particular timeline of bulk-billing, but what's really important, rather than looking at a year-to-year change alone, is to look at the underlying pressures that had been building up. What is clear is that, by the time we got to the 2022 election, all too many doctors were facing a situation where they were just not able to offer bulk-billing at the rates they would have liked to or, indeed, at all. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners took the extraordinary step around this time of calling on every GP in the country to stop bulk-billing to maintain the viability of general practice. Dr Karen Price said that: 'This is why, as a college, I am exhorting everybody, including my own practice, to move as many people as you can onto private billing.' There was a huge pressure building in the system, and that was something that was going to play out in a very dramatic and adverse fashion, particularly for the most vulnerable. What happened when we took over is that we dramatically increased funding to strengthen Medicare. We increased funding by $6.1 billion dollars in the 2023-24 budget—a historic investment, particularly given the state of the overall economy, and that was backed up by an additional $2.8 billion in the 2024-25 budget. To put it in context, this government has delivered more than double the amount of indexation in relation to Medicare than the previous government did in a decade, and it did all of that at a time when the government's fiscal position has been under strain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, we've put into place very significant measures in relation to cheaper medicines: a 60-day prescription and a cap of $31.60 for medicines on the PBS. All of these measures have saved billions across the community, but significantly—for those most vulnerable—they have been particularly beneficial. I can speak for people in my electorate of Fraser that the cheaper medicines initiatives that this government have brought in have been particularly welcome. We have opened 77 Medicare urgent care clinics across Australia, including 19, already, of the 29 Medicare urgent care clinics announced in this year's budget. There have been almost 860,000 visits to Medicare urgent care clinics across Australia, and all of these have been completely bulk-billed. This is a significant measure, and given where these are located—including one in my own electorate, and again, I've talked to people that have used that and seen the benefits that it has produced. This government has turned around this system. It has responded to the under-investment, neglect and ideological poor positioning from the previous government, and the Medicare system is, thankfully, much stronger than it was when we came to power.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear about this: the total cost of bringing dental comprehensively into Medicare over the next four years would be $46 billion, as costed by the independent Parliamentary Budget Office. In context, one-third of Australia's largest corporations pay no tax on hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue. There are large multinational gas corporations that pay less tax than a nurse, despite earning tens of billions of dollars in income.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not kid ourselves: the country is wealthy enough to bring dental into Medicare, and yet we hear these stories from people across Australia who are suffering as a result of a political and economic system that always puts everyday Australians last when the financial interests of large multinational corporations are threatened. We have a plan to, for instance, raise taxes on the super profits of large multinational corporations. Over 10 years, it would raise half a trillion dollars—$500 billion. It could cover bringing dental and mental health into Medicare. It could cover making sure everyone could see a GP for free. Instead, right now that money is going into the profit margins of large multinational corporations.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The stories I just read out should not happen in a wealthy country like Australia. The stories that I read just out are preventable, if only we had a political class with the guts to stand up to multinational corporations, who right now get away with often paying zero dollars in tax. We can bring dental and mental health into Medicare. We can ensure everyone can see a GP for free. We can ensure that the millions of Australians right now who skip seeing the dentist because they can't afford to pay have some light at the end of the tunnel.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:17</span>):  Labor is the party of Medicare. We will always protect Medicare, and we will always do what we can to strengthen it. As an Australian, one of the things that I am most proud of is that, no matter how much money you make, you can have access to world-class health care. This is because Medicare is fundamentally about universal health care. It means that anyone and everyone can get access to the care they need when they need it—using their Medicare card, not their credit card. This is something that should always be protected, and that's why we have made historic investments in Medicare throughout our first term of government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Medicare went through some tough and scary times under the former coalition government, especially under the reign of the current Leader of the Opposition, who was at the time labelled as the worst health minister in living memory. What a reference to have on your CV when applying for the job of Prime Minister! The Leader of the Opposition will say he cares about everyday hard-working Australians, but he will make it harder for you to see a doctor when you're sick, just like he did when he was the king of cuts to Medicare. He doesn't care about how hard you work; he cares about how much money you make—if you don't make enough money, you don't get to see a doctor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why strengthening Medicare has been one of our top priorities. In 2023 we delivered the biggest indexation boost for Medicare in 30 years. This year we delivered the second largest increase, with almost $900 million in additional funding for Medicare. This is where the difference between our approach to Medicare and that of the coalition sticks out like a sore thumb. This government has delivered more than double the amount of indexation to Medicare, compared to what the previous government did in almost a decade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also focused on making it easier to see a doctor. Peter Dutton, doing Peter Dutton things, froze Medicare rebates when he was health minister. This is a trend that lasted for six years under the coalition government. As a consequence, it left the financial viability of general practice in serious trouble. That's why we have tripled the bulk-billing incentive, from 1 November last year, in the largest investment to bulk-billing in history. This has been a national increase of 1.7 percentage points in the first year and 5.4 million additional visits. We have opened 77 Medicare urgent care clinics across Australia. I know for a fact that the people of Cessnock and surrounds are forever grateful for the urgent care clinic in my electorate, which has helped thousands of people who need access to health care. Unfortunately, the opposition wants to cut these two.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also committed to reforming the mental health and suicide prevention systems, ensuring that Australians receive equitable access to the care they need, providing free mental health services through a network of 61 walk-in Medicare mental health centres. Two of these are in my electorate, in Muswellbrook and Cessnock, and the impacts they are having are clear to see.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are always improvements that can be made to Medicare, and perhaps including dental is one of those improvements. I know that the Greens as a party has never and will never come close to forming government. They think you can sprinkle some fairy dust and click your fingers, but, unfortunately, that's not how this world works, and that's not how governments work, and including dental in Medicare isn't something that can be done overnight. However, we are committed to the long-term goal of expanding Medicare to dental health services, and that work is currently ongoing.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will always be the party that prioritises issues that have real impact on people's lives. The Albanese Labor government are party who made the largest ever investment to Medicare, and the coalition are the party who made the largest ever cuts to Medicare. They just don't care about Aussies being able to afford to go and see a doctor. So, when you cast your vote, look at our track record and the things that matter, like Medicare, and then look at the track record of the Leader of the Opposition and the coalition team. This will make clear who really looks after you and who really stands up for the things that matter in your life. An Albanese Labor government cares about Medicare and cares about you, so please make sure you cast your vote wisely when it comes to having that choice.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Education changes lives, and, like many members in this place, I had the absolute privilege of attending Monash University. My alma mater has one of their incredible campuses in my electorate in Caulfield. However, my grandparents on my father's side left school when they were teenagers. They didn't have the opportunity to attend university and access higher education. It wasn't because of attitude; they were brilliant—the opportunity was not afforded them. They moved to Australia in search of freedom, opportunity and equality. Part of that was the ability of their children to have the opportunities that they did not have and for their grandchildren to have the opportunities that they do not. That is what the HECS system is all about. It's about ensuring that everyone can have access to higher education studies. It's about ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to climb the ladder in Australia. I know how much education has changed my family's life, and I know how much education has changed other Australians' lives as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that HECS was never designed for young people to have lifelong debt. I've spoken to countless members of our community who feel the burden of student debt right now. In Macnamara, we have approximately 27,000 people facing student debt—HECS debt. They're feeling it at the supermarket. They're feeling it when they pay their bills. They're feeling it when thinking about whether they can afford to buy a home. That is why I was so proud of our announcement a couple of weeks ago. The Minister for Education announced that we will wipe off 20 per cent of all student debt. That will wipe around $16 billion of student debt for around three million Australians. It's not just university debt; it also includes debt from TAFE courses and apprenticeship loans. Someone with a HECS debt of $27,600 will see around $5½ thousand wiped from their loan next year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, we announced our plans to make the repayment system fairer by cutting the repayment rate as well as increasing the threshold before one starts to pay it off. For someone on an income of $70,000, this means they'll pay around $1,300 less per year in repayments. We know Australians are doing it tough right now and, fundamentally, this is about giving young people a bit more of the support that they need right now. They shouldn't have to be worrying about paying off their HECS debt until they are earning a sustainable income.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, the Minister for Education joined me in the great electorate of Macnamara. We had a coffee with some university students who were at different stages of their university degrees and were talking about what this meant for them. They also told us about the increases in the cost of humanities degree. As a student of the humanities, I completely support the idea of making sure that humanities are not too expensive and that we encourage critical thought, writing, literature history and, of course, politics. Our reforms not only provide cost-of-living relief for people when they need it most but also are about making sure higher education is there and opportunity is there for those when they need it and wherever they live across our great country, including those from regional Victoria. All up, our government will wipe approximately $20 billion in student debt loans for approximately three million Australians. This recent announcement was on top of the budget announcement we made earlier this year to make indexation fairer and wipe an initial $3 billion of student debt. These recent changes provide significant relief for students while continuing to protect the value of the HELP and other student loan systems which have meant that more young people can get access to higher education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Across my electorate we have some fantastic higher education providers, including Monash University in Caulfield and of course the University of Melbourne in South Bank, just to name a couple. I know how much accessing these universities as well as so many of our great universities in Victoria and across our country means to the lives of young Australians. It should be hard. University is hard. You should have to work hard in order to complete it. But it also should be possible, and so should paying off your student debt. We are making changes. We are making it fairer. We are reducing that debt, and we're going to make sure that more young people can have access to university in this great country of ours.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="296272" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MILLER-FROST</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:27</span>):  Australia is a country with a bright future for our citizens. A Future Made in Australia, the National Reconstruction Fund and the energy transition are all big policies that are driving industry and opportunities that every Australian will benefit from whether it is from the secure, well-paid jobs that they will create, the services they will benefit from or the thriving economy. The one thing that all of these strategies need is a skilled workforce. For many of these jobs, an apprenticeship, university degree or TAFE qualification is the entry ticket. When we came into government we inherited workforce shortfalls across the economy. There wasn't a sector that I didn't hear from telling me how hard it was to get the skilled workforce they needed—tradies, the health sector, retail services, manufacturing, defence and the list goes on. The previous government ran down TAFE and universities, cutting their funding, jacking up the cost of degrees and making students and graduates pay their HECS or HELP debts when they could least afford it, as they were setting up their careers and setting up their lives post qualification. No wonder there was a shortage of skilled workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government knows that many students are doing it tough. That's why we are changing the way that HELP debt is calculated. Legislation is currently before parliament to make the indexation rate the lower of CPI or the wages price index, and we are backdating that to 1 June 2023. This makes indexation fairer and wipes around $3 billion of student debt for more than three million Australians. It means that your HECS or HELP debt won't go up faster than your wages. Around 80 per cent of those who will benefit from this change are 40 years of age or under and 50 per cent are 30 years of age or under, the same people who are trying to set up their lives while they establish their career and maybe buy house and start a family. This is a practical and direct cost-of-living measure to help them at the stage of life when they need it most.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also heard from students required to do unpaid pracs as part of their qualification. Some of them had to give up paid work to complete their pracs, and some of them had to move from where they live to a city and pay for accommodation and expenses away from home. Some just couldn't afford to do an unpaid prac, so they didn't finish their qualification. That's an enormous loss to them, but it's also an enormous loss to the country. So we're introducing paid pracs for social work, nursing, midwifery and teaching so that students can afford to complete their prac and complete their qualification. These reforms provide cost-of-living relief for students and graduates, and make higher education better and fairer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also massively expanding and properly funding fee-free uni ready courses to help students set up for success. We've doubled the number of regional university study hubs and established hubs in outer suburbs for the first time. We've established a national student ombudsman to investigate student complaints. And, of course, there is our massively popular fee-free TAFE program, which has delivered over 500,000 places so far and is set to be made permanent. What's next? I'm glad you asked. A re-elected Albanese Labor government will wipe student debt by 20 per cent. That will wipe a further $16 billion in student debts for around three million Australians in relation to apprenticeship loans, and TAFE and university loans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I paid my HECS debt, it was calculated at around 30 per cent of the cost of the course. It's now 40 per cent. Students nowadays are paying more per course than my cohort did, at a time when we want more apprentices and more TAFE and university qualified people in the workforce. We will also raise the income threshold at which you need to start repaying your student debt. The previous Liberals and Nationals government lowered it so that students and graduates on relatively low wages had to start repaying, but we want students and graduates to be able to set up their careers and their lives post qualification. We will also change the way the repayment is calculated so that the minimum repayment is lower.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want Australians to have good, well-paid, secure jobs, and we want Australia to have the skilled workforce that it needs to become an economic powerhouse in this changing world. Helping students and graduates with their student debt is a practical way to achieve both those things and help them with the cost of living.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:32</span>):  I've said it before and I'll say it again: education is the master key to opportunity for all Australians, starting in the classroom at primary schools across the country, right through to the halls of Australian TAFE and university campuses. The doors unlocked for Australians in these buildings have created our families and our communities, as well as our very culture and the country we're so privileged to live in today. Make no mistake. There is no Australia without education. There is no Australia without the hardworking people who have learned trades who are quite literally building the nation brick by brick. And there is no Australia without the innovators across all disciplines who achieved their qualifications at Australian universities. That's why it is on us in this place to support these students who work so hard to build what's in front of us. It's on us to make sure that Australia's student loan system, which has given millions of Aussies the chance to study at tertiary level, is fair and affordable when someone enters the workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what this Labor government is going to do. We're slashing 20 per cent off all student loan debts, wiping a total of $16 billion worth of debt for over three million Australians. We're making paying those debts more affordable by ensuring students are starting repayment when they earn more. We're also helping people with these debts to keep more of what they earn by lowering the rate of repayment. These changes build on this government's proposal to fix the HELP indexation rate as well, which, if passed, will save a student with an average HELP debt around $1,200. This is significant. As the motion suggests, it can't be understated. It is taking pressure off the three million everyday Aussies paying off their student debt, and it is helping them to pay it off sooner rather than later.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a policy that is fighting the cost of living in this country and helps level the playing field for millions of Aussies in electorates like Spence. It's a shame that there are members of the opposition both in this House and in the other place that have referred to these changes as 'a cash splash that amounts to waste'. I'd like to ask those opposite if these changes are wasted on people like Isaac, someone who is currently studying a double degree in my electorate. He told me: 'I think that, for a lot of us, HECS is seen as an investment in our own future. We forego work and a stable income to pursue an education with the promise that we'll be better off once we graduate. In an entry-level law job, I stand to earn as little as $55,000 a year—slightly less than I made working a full-time admin job during COVID. Yet, despite this, I'll meet the threshold for HECS repayments. These changes guarantee I will be earning a decent wage before I start paying it off, and that should be the case for all students. It's good to see that finally reflected by the government.' Isaac is one of nearly 20,000 people in Spence with a HELP debt. Under a Labor government, he will be one of 20,000 people in my electorate paying off their student loans sooner and more affordably while earning more under a fairer system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of changing the game for former students, this commitment achieves something even more important in my view, especially considering the community I represent, and that's changing the game for future students. This goes back to what I said earlier. Education is the master key for opportunity in this country, and all Australians, regardless of who they are and where they're from, need to be able to access it. This is especially important in disadvantaged areas of Australia, like the suburbs of Munno Para, Elizabeth and Salisbury, which I represent. That's because, in those suburbs and across Spence overall, we lag behind in rates of educational attainment. In the north, where families are already disadvantaged, not being able to afford and access higher education just embeds that disparity more and makes it harder to break intergenerational cycles of poverty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why reforms to education, which include the university study hub announced for Elizabeth over the weekend, are especially important for my community. By making the education system fairer and more affordable by smashing barriers to give people greater access to university, education becomes a circuit-breaker for people in the north to lift themselves socially and economically and forge a better future for themselves and their loved ones. This is what a Labor government will never stop working towards, and that is what drives me each and every time I walk into this building. I commend the motion.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300123" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WARE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:37</span>):  I rise to speak on this motion brought by the member for Macnamara. I thank the honourable member for bringing this motion, because it gives me an opportunity to speak about some of the failures of the Labor government in relation to education generally and specifically in the higher education sector. Just by way of background, this motion talks about the HELP indexation. We have seen escalating student debt as a direct consequence of Labor's high inflation and economic mismanagement. Labor is now proposing to change the way HELP indexation is calculated to the lower of the wage price index or the consumer price index. It changes how the HELP indexation is recalculated and backdates that indexation formula for two years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Assuming this bill is passed, the indexation, for example, will be 3.2 per cent on 1 June 2023 and four per cent on 1 June 2024, rather than 4.7 per cent. However, this still means an overall increase in student debt of 11.1 per cent. In the face of this cost-of-living crisis directly attributable to the Albanese Labor government, this is still a kick in the guts for struggling students and the three million Australians still with a student loan. Most of these students will not see a refund, as Labor is trying to suggest, providing no cost-of-living relief whatsoever. This is because there will be a rebate applied against each person's HELP loan account, which, of course, will lessen over time because of indexation, depending on how long it takes to pay off the debt itself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do just make the comment that this is an attempt to assist some university students. What help has been proposed by this government to assist those who will never walk into a university? What help has been provided by this government to assist those people? What help is proposed to be provided by this government to ensure that more people—for example, more of our younger Australians and our older Australians who wish to return—will have a good trades education?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a chronic housing shortage in this country and a chronic shortage of trades across the construction industry, particularly in our manufacturing industries, and I do not hear the government talking anywhere about how they are going to find more fitters, turners and machinists. Those people are the ones running the machinery within our factories, the ones producing manufactured goods and the ones directly contributing to our GDP. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A university education is very important. A university education was the right pathway for me, but it is not necessarily the right pathway for everybody, and we should not be corralling, into a university education, students who either are unable academically to complete the course or will be unable, when they do complete their degree, to find a well-paying and satisfying job into the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill and Labor's overall higher education policy are completely silent on encouraging universities to engage more with industry to ensure that our graduates that are coming out with very large debts will, in fact, be able to get into the workforce at the end of that time. We unfortunately do see a very large number of students leaving university before they've completed their degree. I think there has been absolute silence from the education minister around what we are doing at the high-school level and where we are encouraging our students. Clearly, the large dropout rates say to me that—and this is from careers advisers in schools overall—we are encouraging students to enrol in universities for degrees that they either are not able to complete or do not want to complete. They are still leaving university without a degree and with a massive debt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To conclude, the federal Labor government has absolutely failed in the university sector.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government's decision to invest almost $1 billion of taxpayers' money into the American company PsiQuantum raises several serious questions which warrant scrutiny. Since the announcement was first made by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Industry and Science on 30 April, the opposition has sought to hold up to scrutiny this extraordinary bet which has been made with public money, and the government has trenchantly resisted that scrutiny at every stage. That is why today I'm moving to establish a parliamentary inquiry so that we can find out what happened and who is responsible. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government has chosen to bet a very large amount of public money on one particular company pursuing one particular technology path within the broad field of quantum—a field in which people who have worked for 20 or 30 years cannot say with certainty which of the many paths being explored is likely to achieve a successful outcome. On any view, it will be at least several years, very possibly longer, before the technology being developed by PsiQuantum is proven to work, if it can be proven to do so at all. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that a very poor process was followed to get to this decision. The Albanese government agreed to assess an unsolicited proposal from PsiQuantum as early as November 2022, two months before external probity advisers were engaged. The Department of Industry, Science and Resources entered into a non-binding agreement with PsiQuantum in June 2023, yet the government points to an expression-of-interest process which commenced only in August 2023. It was an expression-of-interest process in which companies were invited to participate by one email only. There were no follow-up telephone calls; there was no second email. Those who were invited to participate were told they could not speak with Australian government officials. This was after PsiQuantum had been speaking for more than eight months with Australian government officials, up to and including the minister, who had visited their premises in California and had met with them directly. We now know the terms of the expression of interest. It essentially asked respondents to match the promise made by PsiQuantum of building a fault-tolerant, error corrected quantum computer by 2030. Many in the sector are extremely sceptical that this can be done. But scepticism is not welcome in Minister Husic's regime.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that Minister Husic has a particular interest in venture capital firm Blackbird. In October 2022, he appointed Clare Birch of Blackbird to the National Quantum Advisory Committee. In December 2022, he appointed Kate Glazebrook of Blackbird to the Industry Innovation and Science Australia Board. In May 2023, he launched the National Quantum Strategy with Nomad Atomics, a Blackbird funded company. On 30 April this year, he announced almost $1 billion in funding for PsiQuantum, a company in which Blackbird is an investor. Blackbird and the many other investors in this company of course greatly benefited from that decision and that announcement. It is on the record that there is a close personal friendship between the minister's senior adviser Ellen Broad and Blackbird executive Kate Glazebrook.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've written to the Auditor-General requesting that the Australian National Audit Office undertake an investigation into the Australian government's investment in PsiQuantum, and the Auditor-General has responded that a potential investigation is being considered. There are many aspects of what happened here which are very concerning, and there needs to be a parliamentary inquiry to get to the bottom of this decision, the reasons for it and many other aspects of what happened. We know a deputy secretary who advised against this commitment of funding subsequently left the department after being on gardening leave for a considerable period of time. We know that Export Finance Australia was directed to commence work on providing the funding even before the expression-of-interest process had concluded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The sad reality is that, as a consequence of this decision, Australian taxpayers are now exposed to almost $1 billion of their money being put at risk in what is a remarkably speculative venture. The minister has publicly stated that he welcomes scrutiny of this investment, and now is the time for him to back those words with action. If he's serious he will arrange for this resolution to brought on for a vote and for Labor to vote in support of it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:47</span>):  I'm glad to have the opportunity to talk about this motion brought forward by the member for Bradfield. I feel that this is a similar theme and that we've been here before, talking about science and the future. On a previous occasion I spoke about the nature of science. Science isn't about guesswork or clinging to the past; it's about methodology. It's about facts and evidence and about taking actions based on that evidence. But here we are again, and what's the opposition up to this time? I feel like they're stuck in the seventies, the eighties or the nineties, refusing to embrace the future. Let me tell them something. The future is coming, and it's coming fast—and the future is quantum computing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Swan, we indeed are leading the change. Swan is the home to the most powerful research supercomputer in the Southern Hemisphere. It's called the Pawsey supercomputer. It is a world-class facility that is doing incredible work. Back in September, I hosted a meeting with young people from Swan at the Pawsey centre. We held a changemakers conference because we wanted to talk about the future and what we could do to make our country a better place. We hosted it in that space because it was interesting to see the amazing contributions that quantum computing is making. It's making them in leaps and bounds and it's doing this by looking at the future and what we need for Australia. Let me tell you, Deputy Speaker, that they were enthralled. They saw this supercomputer and learnt about the possibilities that it creates. That's what we're doing: we're preparing young people for the opportunities ahead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This isn't just for young people; it's honestly for the whole country. Quantum computing is a game changer. It has the massive potential to transform industries, solve complex problems and deliver benefits to all Australians. That's why we're not just talking about it; we're actually doing it. We're pushing forward. Meanwhile, what's the opposition doing? Tearing it down, ignoring the evidence and sticking to outdated ideas. Unlike them, Labor is embracing the evidence. This goes back to advice that the government has been given. Back in 2023 the nation's Chief Scientist, Catherine Foley, said: </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">This is a high risk, high reward venture, but one that would position Australia as a truly deep tech country …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">She also said we have a chance to build the industry here. She said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">I can assure you I have not drunk the Kool-Aid. The assessment is based on evidence gathered.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is based on evidence, not on Kool-Aid.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's how we as a government work. The government is acting professionally and strategically to move quantum computing forward. We've done the homework. We're investing $470 million in equity and loans to build fault-tolerant quantum computing with PsiQuantum. This isn't some off-the-cuff decision. This is part of a methodical process. The process has involved looking at economic, legal, commercial, technical, probity and also national security advice. It was a whole-of-government effort. That's how you get things done. But what do we get from the opposition? Blockers, not builders. They're constantly saying no. They're the 'no-alition'. They said no to Intel when they wanted to set it up here. Now they're saying no to quantum computing. It's the same tired playbook—to say no to the future and hold Australia back.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fortunately, the Albanese government isn't waiting around for their approval. We're taking action. We're preparing Australia for challenges and opportunities of tomorrow. Quantum computing is a part of that vision. It's about innovation. It's about jobs. It's about ensuring Australia is a global leader in this space. This motion is another example of the opposition's refusal to engage with real work. It's nothing more than what we would expect—them saying no to progress. Well, I say no to their motion, and I say yes to the future—yes to science, yes to evidence, yes to the amazing potential of quantum computing and yes to a government that's getting the work done.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300147" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VIOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:52</span>):  Let's be very clear: the coalition isn't opposed to quantum as a technology. I've advocated for testbed strategies for the whole Australian quantum industry in this House many times. We're opposed to this government picking one winner in quantum, a Silicon Valley based American company, and having the audacity to put that under the Future Made in Australia program. The member for Swan was happy to quote Chief Scientist Cathy Foley. There was a quote about PsiQuantum that the member for Swan and those opposite won't quote, so I'll quote it. This is from the Chief Scientist:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I was also put off by the 'salesman' push and lack of detail in the information provided and how it was presented.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's how the Chief Scientist described the PsiQuantum pitch at the start of the process, before Minister Husic—as he does—brought his pressure to bear on her and she gave some qualifiers. But she did also talk about 'high risk', and that is what we have argued from the start. It is a high-risk strategy to put everything into one company in a contested field, particularly an American company.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have significant concerns about the process. I've spoken on multiple occasions about the email from PsiQuantum as a company to investors prior to the EOI process. In that email, they were spruiking their advanced talks with the Australian government and the significant financial investment that they were going to get from the Australian government. They were spruiking that to investors before the EOI process had started. That leads to significant questions that PsiQuantum have to answer. If PsiQuantum are happy to take over a billion dollars of Australian taxpayer money here in Canberra and in Brisbane in Queensland, they have to answer: were they misleading those potential investors? Were they misleading them by saying they had an advanced negotiation, or did they have that agreement with the Australian government and they were telling those investors in good faith before the EOI process started? They need to enter that question. That is why we need a committee hearing—so we can ask PsiQuantum, who are prepared to take $1 billion of taxpayer money, those questions. The minister should be prepared to answer those questions. Why was this company spruiking it to investors before the EOI process had started? The minister said he was happy for scrutiny to be brought. He should accept this committee hearing. But he won't. He'll hide from this. The taxpayers deserve to know. They deserve to know about this sham process. The quantum industry is outraged.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was first alerted to this EOI process last year. I spoke in this chamber in November last year about the process and the concern from the industry that the EOI process was set up to pick a winner, to pick PsiQuantum. Lo and behold, in April this year, PsiQuantum was the winner of this tender process. This is significant for the Australian quantum industry, because the Australian government is backing a Silicon Valley based US company over Australian industry. It's significant for the quantum industry but it's significant for all Australians because this is under the Future Made in Australia banner, the supposed flagship of the Albanese Labor government. If they are not prepared to answer questions about this investment under that banner, it calls into question every investment made by the Albanese Labor government under Future Made in Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that these questions have not been answered by this minister. If he's not prepared to answer these questions around these conflicts of interest and about this email that many in the industry have seen spruiking support, showing that the EOI process was set up to divert taxpayer money, then the Prime Minister should show some courage and he should ask the minister to resign. There is over $30 billion of taxpayer money tied up in the Future Made in Australia program. This $1 billion is part of that. The Australian people need to have faith that taxpayer dollars are being spent in the best interests of the quantum industry here in Australia and in the best interests of taxpayers, not in the best interests of the minister's friends in Silicon Valley.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:57</span>):  By this motion the coalition are clearly demonstrating they don't think Queenslanders deserve a world-leading project in Queensland that will strengthen the Queensland economy, improve Queensland jobs and increase the attractiveness for private investment in Queensland. The coalition don't believe in a future made in Australia; they certainly don't believe in a future made in Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under our plans for A Future Made in Australia, we're going to see our country be able to stand on its own two feet, revitalising our manufacturing and technological muscle that withered under the previous coalition government. That is why, together with the former Queensland Labor government, we committed to invest $470 million in equity and loans in PsiQuantum. This is a world-leading global firm founded by two Australians. Those opposite constantly talk about Silicon Valley. This was founded by two Australians, Jeremy O'Brien and Terry Rudolph. One of them was born and raised in Queensland and both were educated in Queensland. They're two of the world-leading experts in the area of quantum computing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The sad thing is that every time the member for Bradfield and those opposite call this a US company they're telling Jeremy and Terry, who are two of our smartest Australians, that they don't want them here. They grew up here. They're Australians. The coalition doesn't believe in a future made in Australia and it certainly doesn't believe in a future made in Queensland. These blokes are Australians. Like so many, they had to leave our shores because they didn't get their ideas backed enough. Now they want to bring those ideas back and build the world's first commercial-scale quantum computer in Brisbane in the state of Queensland, my home state. This will mean that PsiQuantum, one of the highest-value quantum computing companies in the world, will establish its Asia-Pacific headquarters and a quantum manufacturing precinct in Queensland, creating 400 new high-paid jobs not just for scientists and experts in quantum computing but for lab technicians, welders, electricians and systems engineers. That's going to be great for Queensland and great for the western corridor outside of Ipswich and Springfield.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They've hit the ground running already, announcing research and education partnerships with five leading Queensland universities. What has the coalition got against Queensland? They're opening a new research and development lab at the Griffith University's Nathan campus in Brisbane and building an Australian team. They're aiming to produce one of the most powerful computers on the planet that can crack problems that conventional computing can't achieve, transforming drug development, aerospace and advanced manufacturing. It means jobs for Australians and jobs for Queensland. It means opportunities for brilliant kids studying in Queensland and around Australia to stay here in Australia rather than—as they, unfortunately, had to do—go with the brain drain overseas. So it's important for Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Springfield City Group in my electorate is keen to establish a quantum tech education centre in Springfield to train the future workers we're going to need for quantum technology industry and related areas like AI, robotics and machine learning. This is an example of how the PsiQuantum project is unambiguously good for Queensland. It's not just about Brisbane; it's about the regions as well, as I alluded to. It means hundreds of jobs, boosting R&amp;D capabilities and bringing billions of dollars of direct investment in Australia by PsiQuantum—an investment that would have gone overseas. It means billions of dollars in economic opportunity for Queensland and a chance for Queenslanders right across our state to have careers in Queensland that will change the world. It's so disappointing to hear that the new LNP state government is reviewing half of the agreement to fund PsiQuantum. That said, we're working constructively with them on a range of issues that will decide, hopefully, a bipartisan approach. I hope they don't listen to their colleagues and comrades here in Canberra because, if they do, they'll be anti science, anti the future, anti development, anti jobs, and anti advanced manufacturing. They're anti-Australian the way they're going on today! You don't hear a word about the fact that the proponents are two Australians. They're constantly downplaying this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have taken a whole-of-government approach. There has been national security and transparency and probity checks in relation to it. All those opposite can say is no to everything. They vote against bills in the chamber that will benefit the country, and today they want to put forward a motion that is anti jobs, anti Queensland and anti economic development. They are turning their back on the future. They are always happy about the past. Go back to Menzies!</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:02</span>):  I appreciate the lecture from those opposite who are opposing a probity motion and a governance and integrity motion merely to look at something. If there's nothing to be concerned about, the government should have no fear whatsoever in seeing the motion progress, but we seem to have touched a nerve. They seem to be very concerned about any avenue that would see a bit of sunlight shone upon what seems to be a very, very murky deal that the government has done over this massive grant to PsiQuantum of Commonwealth and state funds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate Premier Crisafulli and express some relief that we now have him at the helm in Queensland. The Queensland government shares the same concerns that the federal opposition do about just what is going on with this billion-dollar allocation of state and federal funds to this American company to build a quantum computer to a specification that has never before been successfully constructed. In the process, we seek to find out why it is that so much murkiness and such a shroud of secrecy have been cast over the decision-making process. As I say, it really does surprise me that the government has a problem with what this motion will do, which is to establish an inquiry into all these things. If you've done nothing wrong, you've got nothing to fear and you should have nothing to hide. If successful, this motion would have a process that, if you believe the government, would merely confirm that everything they've done regarding this half-a-billion commitment of Commonwealth funds to an American company called PsiQuantum is completely above board.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Bradfield, who has moved this motion and brought it to this chamber, has made very important points in the past in scrutinising this. We know there has been correspondence with the Auditor-General. Other integrity bodies may or may not want to look at this murky deal and, in particular, some of the personalities involved in getting special access to the ministers that made these decisions and the past connection those lobbyists might have had with said ministers. All these things would be good to flesh out in the inquiry we are proposing through this motion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a time in the last parliament—which I was a part of—when we got very consistent lectures from the now government about integrity and looking at what the executive of government was doing. In fact, if the shoe were on the other foot, I could just hear, and my ears could ring, from the sorts of bellowing that would be coming from the now Labor government about the need to support this motion. So they have the opportunity to put their money where their mouth is—half a billion dollars of money where their mouth is. They can honour their piousness from previous parliaments on topics like this and, in particular, explain why, if they're not supporting this, what holding an inquiry into allocating half a billion dollars of Commonwealth funding through very murky and questionable processes, with no merit based opportunity for others to compete for the sorts of funds being allocated, be something to fear? Why would there be a problem with the parliament exercising its responsibility, which is the oversight of the executive and the expenditure of Commonwealth funds, and why would there be anything to fear in supporting the establishment of this inquiry that the member for Bradfield brings before us today?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to get to the bottom of the questions we would be probing through this committee. I want to tell my constituents why this half-a-billion-dollar deal was done the way it was done, why it wasn't merit based and why certain lobbyists were able to secure meetings with ministers and spruik the investment of this scale. It's very interesting that the new Queensland government has the same concerns and is questioning whether it will invest in what was announced by the previous Labor government. Supporting this inquiry, if there's nothing to fear, should be something that this government does.</span>

As the member for Bean in the ACT, in the nation's capital, home to many of Australia's leading high-tech users and developers, I am acutely aware of the need for Australia to build its own capacity and to reduce our nation's dependency on overseas—and when it comes to quantum, it is a race. With all the tragedy and suffering, the COVID era provided us with a useful wake-up call that Australia must do better in building our capacities in the space of the new technologies shaping our world today and into the future. Whilst this motion is purely here as political play by the opposition and should be seen as such, I am pleased this debate provides an opportunity to talk about some of the positive thinking and action this government is taking in this space.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under our plans for a future made in Australia, the Albanese government is revitalising our manufacturing and technological muscle that just withered under a decade of coalition governments. But to grow in the years ahead, modern economies need strong manufacturing and technological capability. That's why, with the Queensland government, we committed to investing almost half a billion dollars in equity and loans to PsiQuantum, a globally leading firm founded—again, to remind the opposition—by Australians Jeremy O'Brien and Terry Rudolph, two of the world's leading quantum physicists. This will mean that PsiQuantum, one of the highest valued quantum computing companies in the world, will build the world's first commercial-scale quantum computer and establish its Asia-Pacific headquarters here in Australia. This is in keeping with Australia's first ever national quantum strategy, announced in May 2023 by this government.f It means hundreds of jobs, extra grunt to our R&amp;D capabilities and billions of dollars of direct investment in Australia by PsiQuantum—investment that would otherwise have gone overseas. It means research and education scholarships, industry partnerships, supply chain opportunities and a dedicated climate research centre. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the Australian government announced this investment, the US government has followed suit, supporting PsiQuantum's second facility in Chicago. PsiQuantum has already hit the ground running in Australia, announcing research and education partnerships with five Queensland universities, opening an R&amp;D lab and building for an Australian team. We released the Chief Scientist's advice on this important investment, which emphasised its impact on our local industries. It said:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Having this big company in Australia will attract the supply chains here and provide an uplift in adjacent industries such as photonics … and semiconductors which are as critical to human life now as water, food, housing and energy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Chief Scientist described it as being our Taiwan moment. Just as Taiwan moved into semiconductors in the 1970s, here was our chance to be a global hub for the quantum industry. But the coalition wants to take Australia backwards, whilst we want to invest in Australia's future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We agree that the process is important, and it's important to put on the record here that this was a rigorous, extensive, whole-of-government process with economic, legal, commercial, technical, probity and national security advice. We drew on expertise from across government and outside it, including from our Chief Scientist, who scrutinised PsiQuantum over many months, asking the hard questions. This was her ultimate conclusion:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Small">This is one opportunity that will mean Australia has a real quantum industry … that will be world leading.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Her assessment has been backed by the technical advisory group, including scientists from CSIRO and the Defence Science and Technology Group, concluding that PsiQuantum demonstrated extensive experience and considerable capability and the necessary capacity to pursue its technical roadmap.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government also ran an expression-of-interest process in accordance with public sector advice to assure ourselves that we weren't overlooking a competitor who might be as close to PsiQuantum in delivering a fault-tolerant quantum computer. We've released that EOI assessment. It's not murky; it's incredibly transparent. That assessment outlines the rigour taken by the assessment panel and technical advisory group, with comprehensive probity advice. The panel found no applications were competitive or highly competitive. In the Chief Scientist's words, the EOI found PsiQuantum were 'a country mile' ahead.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249224" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms RYAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:13</span>):  On 4 November, members of this House gathered with GPs and doctors from around the country to celebrate the Stronger Medicare Awards. This was a significant event, and I'm pleased to say that that night Dr Lester Mascarenhas, who runs the Utopia clinic in my electorate, became a Medicare Champion for working in primary care. I was thrilled to be there with Dr Mascarenhas—with Lester—when he was called forward to receive this award because the work that he's done at Utopia is truly inspiring. This is a clinic established—that is now, actually, a charity—to support refugees and asylum seekers who live in my community with their very real health needs. Lester is an inspiration in the health fraternity. He and his partner, Vern, came to Canberra to be acknowledged for that work, and he was surprised to be named a Medicare Champion. The work they do in my community is incredibly important, and it's important, too, to share the way Utopia came to be. It came to be not by imposing ideas upon a community about what was needed but by working with the community outside of the health area and getting to know that community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The highest number of refugees in my community come from Myanmar of Karen, Karenni, Chin and Kachin background in terms of their ethnicities who have settled in our area, and Utopia has become their go-to place for their health needs, not surprisingly, because they have interpreters on the ground. They have specialist connections into infectious diseases. They really have shaped this clinic to support the community it's designed to support. I want to celebrate Dr Lester Mascarenhas and all who work at Utopia Refugee and Asylum Seeker Health, because they've changed lives—the lives of many who have chosen to call Melbourne's outer west their new home. They spent a year in consultation before they established the clinic, and now the clinic has a unique model of care, supporting the complex and often unmet needs of refugees and asylum seekers in my community. A big congratulations to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason this government chooses to have the Stronger Medicare Awards is that it is just one more way of ensuring that people understand our commitment to Medicare and our commitment to bulk-billing. Since coming to government, we've had an incredible turnaround from the previous government's policies on bulk-billing, with the incentive tripling from 1 November last year, notably the largest investment in bulk-billing in history. Since then, there have been 5.4 million additional estimated visits across Australia because of this government's investment. That's 103,000 visits to a GP a week. On top of that, we've introduced cheaper medicines. We've introduced a Medicare urgent care clinic. We have one in my community as well in Werribee, which is taking considerable pressure off our public hospital, the Mercy, by seeing patients, particularly the number of children that the urgent care clinic is seeing and particularly in those busy times, busy sports times, after hours, after normal medical hours and particularly on weekends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More importantly, though, for my community, this government restored Wyndham's distribution priority area status after the Morrison Liberal government cut it. This meant that we lost 40 per cent of GPs in some practices across the city of Wyndham. Those numbers are rebuilding back again since we restored the DPA status. With that and the tripling of the bulk-billing incentive, we're seeing more GPs working longer hours and being open for longer hours in my local community, which means better health outcomes for many people. It also means that practices have an opportunity to do that kind of delivery, that kind of wraparound health services that we're seeing for our refugee and asylum seeker communities at Utopia. It means that the doctors who work in these clinics know that this government has their back, that this government is committed to Medicare and that they're committed to primary health care.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:18</span>):  The distribution priority areas might be okay in the member for Lalor's electorate. Her electorate is just 17 kilometres north of Melbourne's central business district. But it's not there that the doctors are most needed. It's out in regional and particularly remote Australia where they are now suffering because of the distribution changes brought about by this Albanese Labor government. The Rural Doctors Association said that the ink wasn't dry on the changes to the policy before doctors were already leaving the bush. Doctors were already leaving those areas in the country which were already doing it tough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud of the fact that I put in place as Deputy Prime Minister the Murray-Darling Medical Schools Network. That goes through Wagga Wagga, Orange, Mildura, Dubbo and so many places that were crying out for doctors—not necessarily those regional hubs but many of the little towns around them, many of the little bush hospitals that relied so heavily on those major country centres. But for that rural medical school network, I don't know where they'd be. I don't know where some of those centres would get their doctors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard the member for Lalor talking about the pharmaceutical dispensing changes. My goodness! Country pharmacists—there are more than 300—are the only health professionals in some of those 300 communities, because they don't have a doctor and they don't have a hospital. They just have a chemist—a chemist that was going to be forced to potentially shut because of that change, because of that new 60-day rule that Labor put into place. Then we look at health and talk about bulk billing. Bulk-billing rates have fallen dramatically by 11 per cent under Labor's watch. If Labor members can get up and claim that we are better served, healthwise, under them than under the previous coalition government, I tell you that they are absolutely kidding themselves, and they are indeed misleading the House. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very pleased to talk about the record of the former coalition government in health. There were more than 94 million telehealth consultations through Medicare with 16 million patients. Telehealth is not the answer; we need professionals, face-to-face. But, in rural centres, where sometimes you can't get that face-to-face contact, then telehealth is doing the job. There were 857 new medicines listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme since 2019 in that last term of government alone and more than 128,000 Australians supported by headspace each year. Everybody across the parliament would agree that headspace is doing a great job with mental health with our young people. There were 1,400 additional nurse placements for the regions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The distribution priority areas changes have enabled places such as outer suburban areas of metropolitan cities, the Gold Coast, Newcastle and Wollongong to say that they are short of doctors at the expense of regional centres that in some places don't have a doctor for hundreds and hundreds of kilometres. It shouldn't be that when in pain, catch the plane. It shouldn't be that way. Doctors should be encouraged in every way, shape or form to put their shingle up in a country centre, but Labor has taken that away. They have absolutely taken away the incentive and the encouragement by putting in place a measure by which they say that some of these peri-urban centres somehow should be in the distribution priority areas. They are not; they should not be in that list, because it's coming at the expense of hard-working Australians, who, I might add, carried this country during COVID. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When every city type wanted to pull their doona up over their head and pretend that life wasn't happening and it would all blow over, the regional people in many of these remote centres were doing the farming, growing the food, growing the fibre, doing the mining that kept this nation's lights on, kept this nation fed and kept the clothes on people's backs and not just for Australians but for many other nations besides. Then Labor members come in here with these motions, talking themselves up as though they are the ant's pants to health provisions in this country. Well, I'm calling it out. Indeed, Labor has not been good for health, and particularly for regional health, which is crying out for more doctors and nurses. What have we got? We have a government that doesn't know, doesn't understand and worst of all, doesn't care.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:23</span>):  I rise today in strong support of this motion celebrating the 40th anniversary of Medicare, one of Australia's most transformative government programs. I want to thank the member for Solomon for bringing this to the House today. Medicare enshrined access to health care as a right for all Australians, regardless of income or background or where they live. Its legacy is one of compassion, fairness and equity in the provision of healthcare services. As we celebrate Medicare's 40th birthday this year, it is important to acknowledge the extraordinary individuals and teams that continue to exemplify Medicare's promise through their own dedication and innovation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Stronger Medicare Awards celebrate primary healthcare professionals across the country who go above and beyond to enhance the health and wellbeing of Australians. I'm very proud today to acknowledge two recipients of that award from my electorate who were honoured for their outstanding service to healthcare. I want to congratulate Dr Andrew Palfreman and Next Practice Canberra for their contributions to caring for our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Palfreman has shown unwavering dedication to the health of his patients, especially in times of crisis. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he took the extraordinary step of setting up a temporary building in his practice's carpark. This innovative measure allowed for the safe treatment of infectious patients while simultaneously facilitating critical vaccination clinics for the community. Dr Palfreman's commitment goes far beyond his practice walls and carpark. He works with Canberra's 'Chat to PAT' bus service to bring health care to vulnerable and homeless Canberrans, exemplifying Medicare's ethos of inclusive compassion and care. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Next Practice Canberra has similarly demonstrated the gold standard of patient care. I was really pleased to meet Dr Paresh Dawda and Heema Dawda from Next Practice at the awards. This practice delivers multidisciplinary, individualised and coordinated care to people with complex and chronic needs. Among its patients are hundreds of individuals in residential aged care, those who are housebound, people with disabilities, and patients with palliative care needs. By forming integrated practice units comprising GPs, nurses, nurse practitioners, patient advocates, pharmacists, social workers and a range of other specialists, Next Practice stands as a beacon of holistic, compassionate and team based care. Their work is a testament to what can be achieved when healthcare professionals collaborate to meet the diverse needs of our communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge Gareth Wheeldon from Capital Chemist, who was a finalist for the Stronger Medicare Awards. As a co-owner of Capital Chemist at the University of Canberra, Gareth has made a significant contribution to breaking down barriers for vulnerable and marginalised communities in Canberra. He collaborates with local organisation Meridian to deliver free vaccinations for people living with or affected by HIV, the LGBTIQ+ community, and people at enhanced risk of HIV and STIs. Through the Sex Workers Outreach Program, Gareth also provides vital vaccinations at workplaces, ensuring accessibility and safety for a vulnerable group within our community. This commitment to breaking down barriers is exactly what Medicare represents—healthcare that is accessible and inclusive for everyone. All of us in this House have the deepest respect and gratitude to all healthcare professionals who tirelessly work to keep our communities healthy. Their efforts embody the fundamental belief that it is in your Medicare card, not your credit card, which guarantees quality healthcare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Medicare was a Labor innovation, and Labor will always act to improve Medicare and to keep it strong. Whether it be the biggest investment in bulk-billing in Medicare's history, the establishment of 87 Medicare urgent care clinics around the nation, the introduction of 60-day dispensing and cheaper medicines or our commitment to significantly increase funding for our public hospitals, Labor is the party of universal health care, the party of Medicare and the party of a healthier Australia.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282237" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ARCHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:27</span>):  It's a pleasure to speak to this motion today and take the opportunity to congratulate all the hardworking and dedicated health professionals in my community and, in particular, to highlight a couple of stand-out services that have recently been awarded for their innovative contributions. Firstly, I want to acknowledge the government's recent Stronger Medicare Awards and share the fantastic work of one of the inaugural winners, City Mission's Mission Health service in Launceston, in my electorate. Local nurse practitioner Jane realised there was a gap in services that could provide free health services to the homeless. Jane joined forces with a registered nurse and lecturer, Michele, and collaborated with City Mission, a charity organisation, to set up Mission Health clinic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mission Health runs on a weekly basis, providing bulk-billed health care for patients in Launceston experiencing homelessness. The service provides free health care for people who may otherwise go without, and has been assisted by the volunteer efforts of other local health practitioners. Services include chronic health management, general health assessments, immunisations and sexual health testing, and it is making a measurable and substantial difference to the lives of vulnerable people. Jane said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">…that Medicare has been an integral puzzle piece in the establishment and continued running of Mission Health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Without Medicare, the clinic would either be non-existent, or it would have been far more difficult to achieve what we have. Without Medicare, much of Mission Health's work would mean this group would pay private costs for prescription medication, there would be problems referring to local hospitals, obtaining Medicare funding toward radiology and pathology investigations, and so much more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As one of the clinicians of Mission Health, Medicare means that I can receive a fee for service in the work to support homeless people of Launceston. I have elected to return a percentage of this fee to the clinic to buy essential consumables such as wound care products.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This cohort of people have difficulty managing appointments, so the drop-in service is ideal for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mission Health routinely sees patients in need of immediate health care. Recently, the service helped a young woman with a hormonal device that was three years past its effectiveness date. Mission Health was able to remove the old device, replace it with a new one and provide a health check. There are countless stories like this that Jane and her team encounter each week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an innovative and responsive service. It's a model that could be expanded, with greater support, but it will need further support. Although Medicare has helped in delivering this important service, it is not completely responsive to the model, and attention will need to be given to ensure the service's ongoing sustainability. I have met with Minister Mark Butler to raise the issues facing the centre, going forward. I thank him for his time and interest in the program, and I hope that a sustainable pathway can be assured.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, I congratulate RACGP General Practice of the Year award recipient Beaconsfield Family Medical Practice, led by practice principal Dr Reddy, as he's known to his patients. He only took over the practice in 2023, as a solo GP, but in a little over year he's grown the clinic to now include four full-time GPs and integrated allied health services, and he's bulk-building all his patients. It must be pointed out this is an exception to the norm in Tasmania, with most practices unable to bulk-bill at that level. Primary Health Tasmania, Tasmania's primary health network, provided information and support in areas including accreditation, Australian government funding programs, digital readiness work and other programs. Dr Reddy said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We feel like the PHN has stood as a backbone in this journey of our new medical practice, and we are very thankful for that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">What I've seen in this last 12 months is that not only did Primary Health Tasmania help me to set up the clinic, but it also helps me and my staff to have continuous professional development through the workshops it runs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The community has embraced the GP and his young family with open arms. I visited the practice recently, and I can see how much of a difference the increased services have meant to the community. I'm excited about the vision and enthusiasm that Dr Reddy has for delivering health care in this rural area, but, again, more needs to be done. Medicare plays an important part, but it's not the whole story. I am happy to give credit where it's due, but I'd urge the government to redouble its efforts, because the job is far from done. There remain huge and urgent gaps in primary health care provision in Tasmania. Despite the unfortunate self-congratulatory tone of this motion, many Tasmanians are being left far behind, and the Tasmania Liberal government has been doing much of the heavy lifting to fill the gaps that the federal government has not filled. The government has opened new urgent care clinics, but, in the meantime, primary health practices have continued to close in regional and rural areas. Your Medicare card may be more important than your credit card, but it is still your postcode that you need to turn your attention to.</span>

                  <a href="157125" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:32</span>):  I would like to thank the member for Solomon for moving this motion, providing us with the opportunity to celebrate a monumental milestone in the history of our nation: the 40th anniversary of Medicare. This year marks four decades since the introduction of a healthcare system that has fundamentally transformed the way Australians access medical services. Since its inception, on 1 February 1984, Medicare has stood as a beacon of equality in ensuring that health care is not a privilege reserved for the wealthy but a right shared by all Australians, regardless of their income or background.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The establishment of Medicare was one of the most transformative moments in Australian history. It was a bold step towards creating a society where every individual could seek medical help without the fear of financial ruin. This revolutionary system was built on the principle that health care should be accessible for everyone. Medicare has evolved significantly over these 40 years, from its early days of paper claims and lengthy queues to today's streamlined digital process that allows nearly half a billion services to be processed annually. This evolution reflects not only advancements in technology but also a commitment to improving accessibility and efficiency in health care delivery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To commemorate this historic occasion, the Albanese Labor government has launched the Stronger Medicare Award. These awards recognise primary healthcare professionals from all corners of our country who have gone above and beyond to improve the lives of Australians. I'd like to take this moment to congratulate all finalists and winners of these prestigious awards. Your dedication and hard work exemplify the spirit of Medicare and demonstrate how vital primary care is to our communities. We extend our heartfelt gratitude to every general practitioner, nurse, midwife, pharmacist and allied health professional working tirelessly in primary care. Your commitment keeps our communities healthy and thriving. You are the backbone of our healthcare system, and it is your unwavering service that ensures that all Australians have access to quality medical care. As we celebrate these achievements, let us reaffirm our fundamental belief: it is your Medicare card—not your credit card—that should guarantee access to quality health care. This principle is non-negotiable and must remain at the core of our health policy as we move forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, we must also acknowledge that this commitment has faced challenges. The current Leader of the Opposition once attempted to introduce a tax on visits to GPs. He froze Medicare rebates, cut $50 billion from hospitals and claimed there were too many free Medicare services. He was even voted by Australia's doctors as the worst health minister in Medicare's history. These actions serve as a stark reminder that only a government dedicated to protecting and strengthening Medicare can be trusted with its future. As we look towards the future, it is essential that we continue to build on the legacy of Medicare. The recent launch of initiatives like MyMedicare aims to enhance continuity of care and improve access for patients through tailored health packages. These advancements are critical as we strive to ensure that every Australian can receive care at the right time and at the right place. Moreover, as we reflect on what has been achieved over the past four decades, we must also consider what lies ahead. The landscape of health care is consistently changing, influenced by new technologies, emerging health challenges and evolving patient needs. It is crucial that we remain adaptable and responsive to these changes, while upholding the principles that have made Medicare a cornerstone of Australian society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, as we celebrate 40 years of Medicare, let us honour not only its legacy but also those who fought tirelessly for its establishment and those who continue to uphold these values today. We are fortunate to live in a country where access to health care is recognised as a fundamental right—a right that must be fiercely protected against any attempt to undermine it. Let us move forward together with renewed commitment to strengthen Medicare for future generations, so that it remains a source of pride for all Australians. The Albanese Labor government is dedicated to this vital cause and committed to ensuring that every Australian can access quality health care without fear or hesitation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="MT4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BROADBENT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:37</span>):  Australia has a world-class health system: Medicare. The backbone of that system is the dedication of our highly skilled, hardworking healthcare workforce. These healthcare workers are subject to intense conditions that wouldn't be acceptable in any other industry, but day in day out they get on with their job and do it wonderfully. They bore the brunt of the pandemic. Even though overwhelmed by immense pressure and unknown variables, healthcare workers stood as our first line of defence. But, four years on, healthcare workers are still overwhelmed in large part by unprecedented and unexplained levels of sickness right across the country. Why isn't anyone investigating this phenomenon? The Australian people deserve answers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I rise to speak on a matter of grave national importance which has, until now, been met with silence by those who should be taking decisive action. My recent correspondence with the Prime Minister highlights alarming findings in synthetic DNA contamination in Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 products, detected at levels of up to 145 times above the TGA's own stated limits. Let me assure you that I did not write those letters lightly. My letters were accompanied by a science summary co-authored by 52 eminent scientists including Dr David Speicher, a Canadian virologist, who authored the report investigating DNA contamination in Australian COVID-19 Pfizer and Moderna vials; Professor Angus Dalgleish, one of the world's leading oncologists; Emeritus Professor Wendy Hoy; Emeritus Professor Robert Clancy; Professor Alexandra Henrion Caude; and Kevin McKernan, former research director of the Human Genome Project. These distinguished individuals put their names and reputations on the line attesting to the overwhelming evidence of synthetic DNA contamination in these vaccines and the risks posed to Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The science summary speaks directly to the catastrophic implications of this contamination. Experts have determined that as few as three to 10 molecules of the SV40 promoter and enhancer sequences contaminating Pfizer's product can potentially trigger cell mutations, leading to cancer. Yet Dr Speicher's analysis of Australian vials detected billions of these molecules in a single dose. For the TGA to dismiss these concerns outright without credible testing or scientific analysis is a failure of duty to the Australian people. Even as the evidence was brought to the attention of the Prime Minister and subsequently passed to the health minister, we received no scientific denial, no testing and no thorough investigation, only a letter from Minister Butler's office referring to the TGA statement asserting the findings as so-called misinformation. The TGA statement has since been revealed as misleading and wholly unreliable, containing at least 14 false assertions, as documented in the comprehensive analysis co-authored by investigative journalist Rebekah Barnett and leading scientific experts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are at a crucial juncture this day. The TGA is yet to perform appropriate tests to confirm or deny Dr Speicher's report findings. The TGA has been using a testing method for DNA contamination that grossly undermeasures the levels of DNA contamination, a method Moderna itself seems deems inadequate for this purpose in its own patent documents for these drugs. No further evidence has been presented to allay the concerns of scientists or the public. Instead, we see avoidance, misleading statements and a complete lack of accountability from our regulators.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I must also draw attention to the extraordinary efforts made by the Town of Port Hedland Council, who, after hearing from cancer expert Professor Angus Dalgleish and from their own community experiencing a sevenfold increase in deaths, passed a historic motion calling for the suspension of these products and for the TGA to conduct independent testing. They took a stand not out of political agenda but from their ethical duty to protect our community. It was the testimony of Professor Dalgleish, observing an alarming increase in aggressive cancers among vaccinated individuals, that gave weight to this decision. Professor Dalgleish's observations are echoed by other medical professionals worldwide who are documenting what they term 'turbo cancers', cancers of an aggressive nature never seen at this scale before.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, for the health and safety of all Australians, I call upon this House and the Prime Minister to act now. Invoke the precautionary principle and suspend these products until independent testing can confirm or dispel these contamination findings. Australia cannot afford the risk of another crisis, one that would eclipse even the devastating Thalidomide disaster. We must protect the health of all Austrians, and that requires transparency, accountability and action.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government has its priorities all wrong. What we need to see from them today and over the next months and years ahead is investment in our crumbling road network in Victoria. If they don't do that it will be another example as to how they have their priorities wrong. Sadly, what he have seen from the Albanese Labor government so far is them cutting maintenance funding to our regional and rural roads in Victoria—as a matter of fact, to roads right across Victoria. We need to see that reversed, and we need to see that reversed immediately. If we don't then the sad reality is that the cost-of-living crisis people are facing at the moment and especially what they have been facing over the last two years will only get worse. Everywhere I go people are now saying to me that they are starting to see their tyres get punctured, they're starting to see their rims get damaged and they're starting to see a greater cost to actually driving on our road network. Not only that but, sadly, in regional and rural Victoria in particular we are starting to see road accidents and road deaths begin to increase again. That is why the Albanese Labor government has to change its priorities and change them right here and now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we take the Princes Highway in my electorate, what have we seen the Albanese Labor government do since they came into power? They've not said to the Victorian state government, 'We'll provide 80 per cent of the funding for the road maintenance if you will provide 20 per cent.' They have said, 'We will only provide 50 per cent.' The Allan Labor government has cut maintenance funding to Victorian roads by 95 per cent, and the Albanese Labor government have dramatically cut their road funding to Victoria as well. This is simply not good enough. I can tell you: the feedback I get from my electorate on a daily basis—and I know other members get exactly the same—is that we need the federal government to immediately take action and start investing in our local road network again. They cannot waste time, effort and money on business cases; they need to make sure they deliver that money right here and now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This isn't against investing in rail. As my constituents know, I advocated strongly for an upgrade to the rail link between Melbourne and Warrnambool, and we got serious Commonwealth investment into that rail network, so this is nothing against rail. This is about the dire emergency facing Victoria's road network. And it's not just me or the member for Casey complaining about this. Even the government's own members of parliament are doing that. If you go and have a look at the member for Corangamite's social media, there is the member for Corangamite complaining about the state of the roads in Corangamite. This is an issue across the board. Everyone in Victoria knows that we're not getting the investment that we need in our roads. Everyone knows that the Albanese Labor government has its priorities wrong in cutting maintenance funding. Everyone knows that the Allan Labor government have their priorities wrong in cutting funding to Victoria's road network.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why this motion calls on Anthony Albanese to immediately invest money in improving our road network in Victoria—both maintenance and building. If he doesn't do this, then, sadly, the phone call that I received a couple of weeks ago is likely to become all too common. A lady rang me and said that she lost her brother years ago in a road accident and, given the state of the roads, she is worried that it will happen again.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249710" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:47</span>):  I reckon that the member for Wannon has probably been asleep for the last two years, or at least on budget night, and must have missed this government's increase in the budget for Roads to Recovery. This government has doubled the funding for Roads to Recovery to $1 billion annually, which we will reach. In my own electorate, that is an increase of up to $20 million for the City of Greater Bendigo alone. That's an increase of $8.5 million dollars to do exactly what the member for Wannon is ranting about: give money to local government to improve our local road network. That is what this government is doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also the history of this Prime Minister. For a long time, as Prime Minister and also as the minister for infrastructure and the shadow minister for infrastructure, Mr Albanese has been a champion of the Roads to Recovery Program. When we were in opposition and the then government decided to index the fuel excise, it was his idea to put that extra money into the Roads to Recovery budget, and that is what he has done. This government, under Anthony Albanese, has a track record in investing in our local roads, because we listen to community, we work with local government and we care. That is why in our budget we've committed to change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not just the Roads to Recovery budget where we have increased funding. We've also increased funding to the Black Spot program, another program that is delivering in Victoria—and in every state. That is where local government nominate to state government which roads are in need of repair. I know, because I chaired the Black Spot group in Victoria, that 25 per cent of the funding is allocated to roads classed as 'at risk', where locals are concerned that there could be a collision, and 75 per cent goes towards projects where there have been incidents already. Funding has gone to my electorate and funding has gone to the electorate of the member for Hawke, who I know will speak on this motion, in relation to this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We take road safety and road repair very seriously and, under this government, we are acting. From $110 million to $150 million per year—that is the extra money that this government is putting in. We're also putting more money into the Safer Local Roads and Infrastructure Program, money which, again, is going to regional electorates. I stood with the local member for Bendigo West, who was allocated money from the federal government to the state government joint funding to improve roads in our electorate, another program that came from this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What the opposition are suggesting in this motion is that, if they were in government, they could not do both. In this motion, they have made it clear that it is either urban rail, through the Suburban Rail Loop, or country roads. It's a devastating admission by the opposition that they are saying they cannot do both. In government, we are delivering both. We have put $2.2 billion of funding into the Suburban Rail Loop. We are saying to those outer metro areas of Melbourne: you should have an urban rail option. That is why we are partnering with the Victorian state government to see that project delivered. We are also delivering, as I said, extra funding to fix our regional roads in Victoria, and we are delivering. It is the Roads to Recovery Program; it is the Black Spot program; it is the new Safer Local Roads and Infrastructure Program.</span>

                  </a>  They're just three of the many projects—and I note the interjections from the member for Wannon, who doesn't like being called out on the political rhetoric that we are seeing from those opposite. They are trying to drive wedge politics, which is either money for infrastructure in outer Melbourne or money for regions. In government, because we have members from the regions and the outer urban areas, we are doing both. We are working with local and state government to deliver both.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the other challenges that we have had in our area—and I am proud to say all three levels of government are working together—is rebuilding after flood events in 2022 and earlier this year. This is another fund that we are delivering. The Albanese and Allan Labor governments are working together to deliver the road and rail infrastructure that the state of Victoria needs.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:52</span>):  Talking about roads in Victoria is very similar to talking about the economy. The Albanese government keep telling us how we've never had it better and the economy is flying, except every Australian is worse off today than they were 2½ years ago. That conversation is very similar to roads in Victoria. We just heard from the member for Bendigo about how great the roads are in Victoria. With all the money that's going in, we've never had it better when it comes to roads. That's news to my community. I was at the Lilydale show this weekend talking to locals—despite the heat, the rain and the storms that came on Saturday and Sunday, as they do in Melbourne—and roads was the second-biggest issue we heard about, behind the cost of living.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My community know all about the Albanese Labor government when it comes to road funding and cuts, because the community had $100 million cut from the Roads for the Community sealing program. That was a program that was going to seal 150 kilometres of road all across my community over 10 years. It was committed to by the coalition in 2019. It had bipartisan support. The then shadow minister for infrastructure, Anthony Albanese, committed to the program.</span>

                  <a href="300147" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr VIOLI:</span>
                  </a>  The program was being delivered on time and on budget, and the member for Hawke can continue to interject, because I know his community is concerned about roads as well. My community knows that that money was committed to by the then Labor opposition over 10 years. That project was being delivered on time and on budget. At Senate estimates, the department confirmed that the project was improving safety in the community, and it was pulled by the Albanese Labor government. My community knows all about the promises when it comes to roads and about the broken promises from this government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also understand firsthand why we need to continue to invest in roads. Unfortunately, the Melba Highway between Coldstream to Yea was, through the RACV My Country Road survey, voted as the most dangerous road in Victoria. As you go up that road, there's a significantly challenging intersection and a big sweeping bend at the corner of the highway in St Hubert's. Just recently, I was driving the road and essentially had the old wobbles from the corrugation on the bitumen road. It was a moment where I was lucky to keep myself safe on that road. It's a dangerous road as you sweep.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The speed limit on the road is 80 kilometres per hour, so the solution from the government is to put up signs slowing the speed to 40 kilometres per hour. That's the solution we get—not to actually fix the problem but to put a sign up warning Victorians, warning community members in Casey, to slow down to 40 kilometres per hour on a road that should be sealed. I've been working with the state member for Eildon, Cindy McLeish, to get that funding upgraded because it's a significant local road and a significant thoroughfare. People use that road for holidays with caravans, and lots of trucks go on that road. But the best we can get is a sign telling us to slow down from 80 to 40. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Warburton Highway section between Seville and Woori Yallock was also near the top of that list of dangerous roads. As you drive along those roads you see the potholes that are continuing to grow bigger and bigger. If we're lucky, we get a patch job, and then the pothole just happens again as soon as it rains. It's going to get worse, as we know the road maintenance budget in Victoria was slashed by 95 per cent. At a time when roads are worse than ever, the funding is being slashed, which means the problem is going to continue to exacerbate. Every week my office gets emails and calls from residents that have been driving along, particularly at night, and have hit a pothole and got rim damage. They have no faith in the federal government actually funding it, because they know it has been cut before, and they have no faith in the Victorian Labor government delivering it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Killara Road, as an example, is another project that shows the Victorian Labor government is unable to deliver projects. They've had that money to deliver that upgrade since 2019, and we're at the end of 2024 and we're still waiting for that project to start. That is the reality for the Victorian people, for the community in Casey. If we commit funding, Labor will do two things: they'll cut it or fail to deliver on the project.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The department has said that the works will start in early 2025, so I'll wait with interest to see whether the Victorian state government actually get on with it and deliver some safer roads for my community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:58</span>):  I'd like to thank the member for Wannon, my neighbour, for moving this timely and important motion about the state of roads, particularly in regional Victoria. Can I say how disappointing it is for me personally that so much of my electorate now falls within the electorate of Wannon. From Apollo Bay to Colac and from Forrest to Anglesea, these are some of the most incredible places across the nation, and the member for Wannon is privileged to have these communities in his electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that these communities and the local councils that maintain the roads across south-west Victoria suffered a decade of neglect under the former Liberal government. After a decade of Liberal neglect, local councils have now received record funding in the past two years under Labor. We're delivering record increases to local council road infrastructure funding. We are progressively doubling Roads to Recovery funding to $1 billion per year, and we're increasing the Black Spot Program by $50 million per year to $150 million. This means that every single local council in Australia will receive more funding for local road infrastructure and maintenance under Labor—more money than ever before for local councils to spend on fixing potholes, improving our roads and making our thoroughfares safer to drive on, particularly in regional and rural areas. This is groundbreaking, and it stands in stark contrast to the Liberals in action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal coalition will say they funded roads when in government, but the reality is that it was clearly insufficient, and it's taken the Albanese Labor government to bite the bullet and address the shortfall. For example, the Liberals should explain to my communities on the Bellarine in Victoria why they did not provide enough funding to get the Grubb Road upgrade in Ocean Grove off the ground. The former coalition government said they would upgrade it, but, as per usual, it was photo op first and community second. The former government underfunded the Grubb Road upgrade from the outset, so the project languished until the Albanese Labor government stepped in and contributed $2.2 million of additional funding. As of October, workers have been on the ground, getting the job done. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's absolutely clear the Albanese government is investing in the Bellarine, Geelong, the Surf Coast and Golden Plains. We've also rolled out about $2 million in blackspot funding to improve road safety within the city of Greater Geelong in the last year alone. I'm advocating strongly on the point of Armstrong Creek, and it is up to the city of Greater Geelong. Because it is local roads, they can apply for funding. I'm wanting them to do more for blackspot funding, and to access some of the funding that the federal government has put forward. I'm pushing them to that in a rapidly growing area that does need attention. We included funding to upgrade the roundabout at Marshalltown Road and Bailey Street in Grovedale. The roundabout had been notoriously dangerous with many accidents just outside the busy Grovedale Primary School. Now, locals have a new roundabout with wombat crossings, a new road surface and street lighting. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also rolled out more than $1.3 million for road projects on the Surf Coast. This has delivered much-needed upgrades for the Esplanade, one of Torquay's busiest thoroughfares along the beachfront. We're also about to upgrade the intersection at Surf Coast Highway and Reserve Road, another much-needed project underfunded by the coalition. Importantly, we're about to kick off early next year on stage 2 of the Barwon Heads Road upgrade. This is in the heart of Armstrong Creek, Charlemont and Mount Duneed, and it's taken a Labor government working with the state to make this happen. This is a joint funding partnership, a $250 million project, that will duplicate this busy arterial road. The upgrade will make a massive difference to local workers, families and business owners travelling to Geelong and the coast, particularly during the busy summer months. On Saturday, we officially opened the Waurn Ponds rail duplication, with works now complete. This is an almost $1 billion project that will mean more trains on the line and fewer cars on the road. It is funded by the Albanese government and the state government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, after a decade of the former coalition government promising the world and delivering little, the Albanese government is doing the work needed.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:03</span>):  I want to commend my good colleague, the member for Wannon, for this very timely motion about how horrible the roads are. This government has done little—in fact, I would say it has done nothing to improve the safety of those who drive in my electorate of Mallee. Hardly a day goes by in my electorate in north-west Victoria where constituents don't complain about the state of the roads. Pick a highway or pick any road—the Calder Highway, Sunraysia Highway, Robinvale-Sea Lake Road, Henty Highway, Murray Valley Highway, Western Highway—they are all awful. Some ask if they can send the bill to the Victorian government for the damage to their vehicle, as the motion states, from driving at high speed to unexpected potholes on major roads. We're not talking back roads here; we're talking major highways.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The roads in Mallee are among some of the most dangerous in Victoria. I regularly drive the length and breadth of my electorate and see firsthand the state of roads that constituents are forced to use every day. The state of the roads beggars belief. There are sections of road in Mallee where the potholes are huge, and the bitumen is hanging on for dear life. I have even had a constituent tell me he toots his horn when approaching potholes to ensure there's not a mob of sheep in there. The safety of Mallee drivers is being compromised by the Victorian state government's poor management of regional road repairs. According to the departmental documents, there has been a 95 per cent reduction in essential road maintenance between 2022-23 and 2023-24 from nine million square kilometres to 422,000 square kilometres. I mean, seriously? Motorists in regional Victoria have been left to navigate a network of pothole-plagued roads that are not fit for use.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">RACV's 2024 My Country Road survey shows that potholes and poor road condition are the biggest safety issues on regional roads across the state, with improving road surfaces a top priority. This issue is of immense concern to regional Victorians—like those who live in Mallee—as illustrated by the 75 per cent increase in responses to this year's survey alone and the finding that while dangerous driver behaviour was the top issue in 2021, now it's poor road conditions, which was rated as more than twice as important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The findings of the Victorian state government's survey reinforce this fact, finding that 91 per cent of roads were in poor or very poor condition. The auditor-general investigated the $2.2 billion dollars the Albanese government had no hesitation in giving to the Andrews-Allan Victorian Labor government's pet Suburban Rail Loop project, which has blown out from an initial $50 billion to—if you don't mind—$216 billion, at last count. The auditor-general said, in September:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As at June 2024, SRL East had yet to go through the formal project approval process, and the department is awaiting a project proposal report from the Victorian Government. This process must occur before funding can be expended.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Victorian government also quietly shut down Regional Roads Victoria earlier this year. Victorian Labor had launched the agency in 2018 with the promise it would ensure 'regional communities have the safe and reliable roads they deserve.' So what do you do? You just remove the agency, so nobody knows how bad the roads are. The Albanese government is 100 per cent responsible, hand-in-glove with the Victorian government, for the shabby and unsafe conditions of the roads in my electorate. They need to be held to account, and that is what this side of the House will do.</span>

Their own legacy is a stain on infrastructure development right across Victoria, especially for the investment in roads. When that lot was in government, Victoria drew the short straw. It was a government that the member for Wannon was not only a member of; he sat in cabinet making those decisions to cut the road funding.</span>

                  </a>  You never funded it. In fact, I will happily stand there and bring the letter, signed by Alan Tudge, that said he is taking away the funding for the Hume Highway. I look forward to the member for Wannon standing up and having to apologise to the House because he's misleading once again. You couldn't fund jack-all. You couldn't deliver a pizza. You could deliver a press release, but that was about it. You cut Black Spot funding in your last government. You cut infrastructure to regional and growing communities across Victoria. Whether it was their mistruths in the election campaigns about the Hume Highway or the Wallan ramps, everything was cut. Nothing was done. They didn't even want to deliver on Yan Yean Road. That left people in McEwen—whether it be Mernda, Wallan, Whittlesea, Kilmore or Gisborne—with deteriorating roads and dangerous driving conditions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The only service they ever gave was lip service, because the now-opposition didn't spend a single penny on road maintenance. Where was the member for Wannon's outrage when his government cut and froze road funding. He didn't care about road safety in Victoria. This is just a political stunt to fill in time and hide the fact that they did absolutely nothing for nine years. He stands here with his manufactured outrage despite the Albanese Labor government increasing funding to $460 million, with a commitment for funding for black spots to increase every year. Only a Labor government can be trusted to protect the upgrade of Victorian roads and to give the people of McEwen a fair go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government will make $4.4 billion available under the federal Roads to Recovery Program over the next five years. Under this program, Victoria will receive $895 million over five years. Before you get your calculator out, I'll save you time. That's $368 million more than Victorians will receive under than they would have received had we unfortunately kept Morrison as Prime Minister. When it comes to finding, as our veterans found out, those opposite only fund things that they think is a political advantage. That is why they never funded the Calder Highway, the Hume Highway and Watson Street.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government has shown its commitment by going on with projects we need in our community, like the completion of the upgrades to Bridge Inn Road in Mernda. It was finished well ahead of time because of governments working together and getting things done. We have made a commitment in this year's budget for an extra $437 million to the Suburban Roads Upgrade program. When the coalition was in government, they did the western one and the eastern one, but then they put the north and south together and only funded half of it. We came and fixed it. Of course, the silence is an acknowledgement that it was badly handled by the former government. We also have the Camerons Lane interchange in Beveridge, with the Albanese Labor government committing $900 million to get this done because it's 20,000 jobs and it's fixing up the Inland Rail, which they absolutely destroyed. It's great to have the Prime Minister and the minister for infrastructure talking about these projects and getting them done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent weeks, we were joined at Wallan to discuss the Watson Street interchange, a project to ensure faster and safer access to the Hume Highway. Where was the $50 million promised by the former government? We know that the former deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, wanted to fund it, but then he got rolled by his own back lot, and the money disappeared, so much so that Minister Tudge took the money out of the complex car park scheme and sent a press release saying, 'Oh, we're going to fund it.' But guess what? When we got there, the cupboard was bare, and Tehan and co had none—no money anywhere for road projects in our area. So I say to the member for Wannon: you should be sticking up for our state of Victoria. Do you remember what happened to your mate Joshie who attacked Victoria? You should stick up for Victoria and try and get things done. You sat there in cabinet eating your triangle sandwiches and having your cups of tea and did not support Victorians. You should be ashamed!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="E0F" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WOOD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">La Trobe</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:12</span>):  I congratulate the member for Wannon for putting this motion up. It's so sad that basic road maintenance in Victoria can't be completed on time. There are potholes everywhere. It all goes back to the way the Albanese Labor government is mismanaging so many things, particularly road funding projects. I can give some perfect examples. We have the Dandenong Ranges, which covers Casey and La Trobe. And places like Cockatoo, Gembrook and Emerald are in very dangerous situations when it comes to bushfires. There aren't many ways to get out of those places. The main way out is using the Wellington Road. So, in 2008, when I was first elected, we put funding into putting overtaking lanes on that road. Sadly, the Yarra Ranges Council decided the overtaking lanes would be deferred. The reason they were so important was that, if there was a bushfire, people needed space to get out of the hills. Sadly, I lost my seat in 2010. The very last thing I did, though, was write to the transport minister, Anthony Albanese, and pleaded with him, 'Do not divert the funding.' As soon as the Labor government came in, the funding was diverted. Going forward into the future to 2018, we recommitted the funding of $100 million to that project to duplicate lanes. What happened again? Labor got into power, scrapped the funding and deferred it. Wellington Road is such a dangerous road. There have been so many serious accidents there and a number of fatalities, and the funding is being diverted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it came to another project we had, the sealing of the Dandenong Ranges, $300 million was committed for the Yarra Ranges Council and Cardinia Shire Council. Again, when it comes to bushfires, if people need to get off and it's smoky and dangerous, people who live in areas in the city might not realise that the curbs on the side may be half a metre deep. If a car goes into that, they're not going to get out, and it's going to jam up the traffic. Again, the Albanese Labor government cancelled all those projects, so Cardinia Council and Yarra Ranges Council are absolutely furious.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to tell you about the waste of funding regarding the Clyde Road upgrade which is going on at the moment. Five years ago, the Liberal government committed to an upgrade there. When we got Casey council road engineers to give us the cost, it was $70 million. Then the state Labor government said, 'Take it or leave it—$250 million.' Obviously they had to look after their mates in the CFMEU, but we're talking about a 900-metre section of road from the train line going over the Monash Freeway that has now blown out to $250 million. For every one metre, it's $250,000 just to duplicate it. Admittedly, there are extra costs when it comes to the on-off ramps and also going over the Monash Freeway, but the price is so much higher than what the engineers at Casey actually submitted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we've got the same when it comes to the Pakenham roads upgrade. The Liberal government got funding for Racecourse Road and McGregor Road. This was a project in the vicinity of $100 million. Now that's blown up to $400 million. It was again take it or leave it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If people want to know how bad the roads are in Victoria and why, it's because there's been a 90 per cent reduction of road funding repairs by the Allan Labor government. Sadly, when it comes to the Albanese Labor government, it has been diverting good road projects and not investing in local councils to actually keep the maintenance of roads, whether it be in electorates like mine or the member for Wannon's. That's why the member for Wannon, like me and the member for Casey—those outer suburban electorates—and the member for Flinders, considers road funding to be so important, and the Albanese Labor government has completely failed.</span>

They have a long and storied history of cuts to all essential services. Australians know it. It's their brand. They do the cuts every time they come in. They cut everything. Road funding is no exception to this. They have cut road funding in regional and outer suburban areas over and over again. Roads are vital to the daily lives of Australians. They connect families. They support businesses. They ensure that we can all travel safer to work and get home again. In my electorate of Hawke, one of the fastest-growing regions in the country, this is particularly true.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:59</span>):  Australia generates more single-use plastic waste per person than any other country, except Singapore. On average, we produce 59 kilos of single-use plastic waste per person per year, compared to the global average of 15 kilos, and most of this comes from packaging. Plastic packaging is the single biggest use of plastic, accounting for 36 per cent of plastic worldwide. Nearly all plastic packaging is single-use, and hardly any of it is recycled. It ends up in landfill. Plastic pollutes our environment and contributes to climate change because it's made from fossil fuels. To reduce plastic packaging pollution, we must reduce the production of plastic packaging.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is developing new packaging regulations to reduce waste and last month sought feedback on the long-awaited draft options for reform. The regulations will increase recycling and ban harmful chemicals, but there's currently no plan to reduce fossil fuel plastic packaging. We can't recycle our way out of plastic pollution. We need to reduce the production of packaging and reuse the packaging that has already been produced. One of my volunteer groups, the Curtin net zero waste group, has been working with me on a petition that asks environment minister Tanya Plibersek to include measures to reduce plastic packaging use in the new regulations. With 12,539 signatures already, I hope the minister will take note.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:01</span>):  I stand here today to advocate for January to be designated as Tamil Heritage month right across Australia. January is significantly to Tamils worldwide as it marks Thai Pongal, the traditional four-day harvest festival that honours the sun, land, rain and agriculture that sustains us. Recognising Tamil Heritage month would celebrate a culture over 5,000 years old, providing younger generations with an opportunity to connect with their roots and inviting the wider community to appreciate Tamil contributions to art, philosophy and language. It would also honour ancient Tamil works like the <span style="font-style:italic;">T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">h</span><span style="font-style:italic;">irukkural </span>by Thiruvalluvar, which continues to inspire us with its timeless insights into ethics, governance and human values.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This recognition would highlight the contributions of Tamil Australians in fields like business and education and public service while fostering pride within the Tamil community. Economically, Tamil Heritage month would benefit local businesses. For example, grocery stores, restaurants and clothing shops would see increased activity as the community prepares for Pongal. Recent Tamil cultural festivals have drawn strong support, with thousands attending, showcasing the enthusiasm for cultural celebrations and the demand for a dedicated Tamil Heritage month. This is an opportunity to celebrate Australia's rich multicultural tapestry. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:04</span>):  On Sunday 27 October, I, along with several parliamentary colleagues, including the member for Spence, attended the annual St Dimitrios Parish feast day, church service and celebration at Salisbury in honour of the church patron St Dimitrios. St Dimitrios was a 4th century AD Christian martyr and continues to be revered as one of the most important Orthodox military saints. The annual celebration is a significant event for Adelaide's Greek community, and particularly for Adelaide's northern suburbs' Greek community, many of whom were amongst the first post-World War II migrant settlers in the region.</span>

My congratulations to Father Psaromatis, His Grace Bishop Silouan, who led the religious service on the day, and to the St Dimitrios parish team for putting on another wonderful celebration of Greek culture, food and dancing.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:05</span>):  Do you want to know how much someone renting a beautiful two-bedroom apartment in the middle of Vienna pays? It's about $250 a week. Meanwhile, the average two-bedroom unit in a capital city in Australia is about $633 a week—if you're lucky. The difference is that that someone in Vienna is living in one of the over 60 per cent of apartments in Vienna either directly built by the government or provided by a community housing provider or co-op where rents are set at prices people can actually afford.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, property is dominated by banks and property developers who want to maximise profit. In Vienna, almost anyone can move into one of these apartments with little to no income limits. These apartments aren't built to maximise profit. They are high quality, well designed, and often integrate play spaces for children, rooftop gardens and other shared social spaces. Rather than just making them available to the lowest income in society, they are made available to a broad cross-section of Viennese society. Professors are living next door to teachers, cleaners, and people on income benefits. That means that the income generated from that scheme allows the city to invest in building more good-quality, well-designed housing. There is absolutely no reason why Australia can't adopt a similar scheme. That's exactly why the Greens have proposed that we establish a public developer to build affordable housing that people can afford.</span>

Why should two identical items, both paid with your own money, cost different amounts? Over time, it really adds up. This is some of the feedback I've received: </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are getting this feedback because we're responding to what people need right now. What people want is a comprehensive plan to cut the costs for everyday Australians. So today I'm also celebrating Labor's plan to make sure that everyday Aussies can use cash when they want to. The truth is that, when people go out and don't have their card or phone on them, they should be able to pay in cash. Labor will work on plans and consult with small businesses to ensure that they aren't unfairly impacted. Cash is a lifeline, especially when it comes to fuel and food. For others, it will make sure that it's the difference between whether there's dinner on the table or not. We're making sure that cash is here to stay.</span>

Earlier this year, I attended the launch of Movember's <span style="font-style:italic;">Real </span><span style="font-style:italic;">f</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ace of </span><span style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span style="font-style:italic;">en's </span><span style="font-style:italic;">h</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ealth</span> report here in Parliament House. Whilst it's clear that progress has been made over the years, sadly, too many men are still dying prematurely, with two in five men dying before the age of 75. This is an issue that is particularly stark in regional Australia. Unfortunately, my electorate of Durack has the fifth highest premature mortality rate in Australia. This underscores the importance of ensuring access to quality health services in the regions for our men.</span>

I send a big shoutout to everyone getting involved this Movember for making a positive impact for men's health, including our Deputy Speaker. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:11</span>):  I rise today to share a speech prepared for the Raise Our Voice competition by Lachie, aged 12, a Woodleigh Penbank student in my seat of Flinders. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I'm concerned about the high price of playing junior sports. Because of these costs, many kids stay inside and spend time on their phones or computers, which negatively impacts their mental health.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When I return to Somers at the age of 21, I want to see kids playing a sport outside with their friends and family. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The way that the State and Federal Governments can help is by increasing grants for junior sports. Currently, grants are limited to $200 and hard to get, but the average cost of playing a sport for one season is $1500.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Increasing these grants would help reduce the 40 per cent of Australian kids who don't participate in sports. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, councils need to make sports teams more welcoming. Currently, 75 per cent of people with disabilities, who want to pay play sports, don't, because they feel they have limited opportunities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Small">It will cost the government less in the end, when those kids grow up healthy.</span>

The first is that we have inflation moderation. The second is we have wages moving. We have the gender pay gap narrowing. We have employment participation higher than it's ever been, with over a million jobs created in the first term of the Labor government. We've delivered two surpluses. We've done all this facing extraordinary economic challenges. I want to pay tribute to our Treasurer, the Assistant Treasurer and the finance minister for the work that they have been doing in this space to ensure that Australians have a job and have a roof over the heads.</span>

We know there is more to do in education, and that's why we're moving into that space now. We have lowered energy prices. We are going to take 20 per cent off people's HECS debts if we are elected at the next election. Labor is committed to a fair country and an educated country, a country where everyone is striving forward for fairness and a fair go for all Australians. This Albanese government is committed to ensuring that we have economic stability and wages growth and that we are creating jobs in Australia for Australians and hence manufacturing jobs for Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:14</span>):  It was a great delight, as it is every year, to attend the Trinity Gardens School fun day last weekend. The whole school community do a fantastic job in pulling together what is a surprisingly—for the size of the school—significant community event. People well beyond those in the school community come from all of the surrounding suburbs to support the school. It's also just a very enjoyable fun filled day. My congratulations to the school governing council, to the school principal and to all those who were involved. All members would have thriving school communities, and the primary schools in particular throughout my electorate do fantastic work in holding events that raise money to supplement the activities that the schools undertake and to support the kids but also add a real sense of community to the local areas in which they serve. Last weekend happened to be Trinity Gardens School's turn to have their event. It was an excellent day, but so many of my schools do similar events throughout the year, and they really do knit and stitch our community together so very effectively. Congratulations to Trinity Gardens School. Thanks for having me. As usual, I look forward to being with you again next year.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Aston</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:16</span>):  As the end of another school year approaches, I've had the opportunity to celebrate the achievements of so many fantastic students from across the electorate of Aston. This has been done through the presentation of the inaugural Tilly Aston Achievement Award. The award commemorates Matilda Ann 'Tilly' Aston, the woman after whom the federal electorate of Aston is named. Tilly Aston was a blind writer, teacher, author and poet and one of Australia's earliest disability activists. Among other feats, she fought hard for the rights of vision impaired people to be able to vote. The award is to recognise outstanding students who demonstrate a commitment to strive for social justice, actively participate in the community and have displayed courage to pursue change. Congratulations to all the winners of the inaugural 2024 Tilly Aston Achievement Award.</span>

I hope it is full of love and joy and that you have a safe and happy time, however you celebrate. For me, I take time to be thankful for my own loved ones and remember those family members and close friends who I have lost. I'm also reminded of the very great privilege of being the member for Aston and of serving the good hearted and generous people in this incredible community and the work they do for those who are less fortunate. Through my position as a federal member, I get to see some of the incredible work that those charity organisations and religious groups do throughout the year, and I want to pay my respects to them. Thank you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:17</span>):  It's fete and festival season in the electorate of Deakin, and I want to congratulate everybody who's been involved with some really outstanding community events of late. We had the Maroondah Festival and Whitehorse Spring Festival over the last couple of weekends, but we've also had parent communities throughout the electorate working really hard to raise money for their local schools. I've been really pleased to spend some time and visit the Holy Spirit Community Fete and the Warranwood Primary School Spring Fair. I have seen the great work done by Rangeview Primary School, St John's Primary School and a range of others that are just excuses to bring the community together to raise some money for great causes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the course of spending time at each of those events and speaking to hundreds, if not thousands, of people from our local community, it has become very clear that leading into Christmas 2024 many families are doing it tougher than probably any of them have felt they've ever done it before. With the cost-of-living pressures that they're feeling, whether it be higher interest rates and higher mortgage repayments, higher energy costs or higher rents that they're paying, for many this will be a very difficult Christmas. My message to them has been that there will be an election next year in 2025 and a great opportunity to turn the page on a government that's made their life worse and has made them poorer, and we look forward to earning their trust in the election next year.</span>

It was terrific to join with Minister Matt Keogh to meet with veterans and their representatives in East Malvern RSL and Waverley RSL. I want to thank everybody who welcomed us, shared coffee and shared lunch with the minister and me. It was a really important conversation that we shared, and I am deeply appreciative of the experiences that people shared with the minister and me.</span>

I laid a wreath and attended two events in my local electorate in East Malvern and at the Waverley RSL. I want to thank all of those who were involved in putting these really important events together. There was great support demonstrated for local community groups and the observance of a minute's silence to demonstrate respect for the service and sacrifice of so many in our community over the years.</span>

I acknowledge the generosity and warmth of community that they foster. Know that I will always support the work of local RSLs in my community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:20</span>):  It was wonderful to be at the Lilydale show and see so many familiar faces, meet locals and hear what matters to them. It was a great event. There was lots of fun for the kids, young and old. There were pony rides, camel rides, reptile and wildlife displays, the wood chop, dog jumps and many more. But it wasn't just great entertainment. It was a chance for our community to come together and learn more and to say thank you to the Lilydale CFA and the Lilydale SES. The car-cutting demonstration certainly attracted a big crowd. The Lilydale Cricket Club, who have the venue at their ground, were selling sausages and raising funds for another amazing community organisation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was lucky enough to be part of the Yarra View Garden Centre Sustainable Scarecrow Competition. It was a tough field, so I vacated the judging and left that to the president, Paul. He had a very tough job. Congratulations to the winners: Chirnside Park Primary School. I also congratulate the other entrants: Don Valley Primary School, Saint Marys Primary School in Mount Evelyn and also Wandin Yallock Primary School.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a wonderful event, with the community coming together, but it doesn't happen without volunteers, so I want to thank the volunteer committee of the Lilydale Agricultural and Horticultural Society led by the president, Paul, and the secretary, Heather. John, who is a life member, was there making sure everything was running well. It comes together because volunteers are prepared to give back to our community so that it can stay strong. I say thank you to them all for a wonderful event.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:22</span>):  It was a privilege to attend mass at Saint Monica's in Richmond last week to farewell John Maguire, my favourite Hawkesbury farmer. I met John about 15 years ago as a leading figure in Hawkesbury Harvest, which he had helped to found to bring together local growers and producers in the region. He was pivotal in the establishment of the harvest trail, which encouraged visitors to buy at the farm gate and gave agritourism a boost in the Hawkesbury before the word really existed. John was also passionate about food security and the retention of farmlands on Sydney's outskirts. He hosted meetings with past agriculture minister Tony Burke and present minister Julie Collins to share these and many other views.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I delighted in visiting Enniskillen, John's orchard and barn shop in Grose Vale and his market stall at Richmond Good Food Market, never leaving without my arms full of fresh produce and locally made jams and other delights. But, more than anything, I loved talking to John, and hearing of the Georgian home he'd grown up in at Emu Plains and its untimely demolition. I shared his conviction of the importance of maintaining a strong agricultural base in the Hawkesbury. I'll miss him but not half as much as will his wife, Trish; his children, Angela, Lucy, Virginia and Adrian; and his nine grandkids. His influence will live on and he won't be forgotten.</span>

One fire has been burning in the north-west of my electorate and in a couple of adjoining electorates, and the other is in and around a section of the Great Ocean Road. Obviously, the weather conditions that we faced in Victoria over the weekend were hot and windy, which meant that those bushfires needed to be brought under control very, very quickly. They also needed a rapid response, and that's exactly what occurred. </span>

I know they all do it very, very selflessly—they do it not wanting recognition—but, time and time again, they're prepared to put themselves in harm's way to protect us. With a bushfire season ahead of us that we know will challenge us, as it always will, I say to everyone in the community to please take care and make sure that you contact the emergency services as soon as you see anything that might be catastrophic.</span>

Whilst we, at a federal level, would like to let our state colleagues do their thing, I'm looking forward to working collaboratively with the new team. I want to take this opportunity to recognise our state candidates and the wonderful job they did during their campaigns and celebrate with a couple but sadly commiserate with the others.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Close to home, it came down to a few hundred—or a bit over a thousand—votes in Macalister and Springwood. Susanna Damianopoulos and my brother, Rob van Manen, did exceptional jobs with their campaigns, but, sadly, they didn't quite get there. Jacob Heremaia ran in the seat of Waterford, and Mathew Owens ran in the seat of Logan. They both ran wonderful campaigns in very difficult seats. Matt got a nine per cent swing to him, and there was nearly a 13 per cent swing in Logan for Jacob, so it was a great result.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:28</span>):  Tiwi people have been rocked by the recent death by suicide of one of our own: a young woman in her mid-20s who, to those around her, appeared to be a beacon of light and positivity. This community role model, who I will call T, exemplified the remarkable progress that Tiwi women have made over the last 10 years. I refer in particular to achievements across a number of different sports, but note that sporting achievements have a significance that extends beyond the footy oval or the tennis court. They constitute a statement to the world that Tiwi women are the equal of men in society.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The passing of T raises a couple of issues that bear careful reflection and consideration. First, there's the issue of private and often lonely pressure experienced by individuals who spend years living, working and being educated down south, who then return home to rejoice and contribute to the advancement of our people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, there's the continuing inadequacy of mental health support services for young women across northern Australia, particularly in remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. She was by no means the first woman to go down this pathway. Going forward, I'm totally committed to working for change, and I know that the Albanese Labor government is too. There will be more to say on this, because the memory of young women like T must not just be another statistic.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bonner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:30</span>):  Last Wednesday, my staff and I arrived at work to find that my electorate office had been graphically vandalised. We are fortunate to live in a wonderful country and enjoy the freedoms that we do, but callous actions like these completely undermine our shared values. Thank you to all the many locals and community groups who have offered their support, as well as my council, state and federal colleagues.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Violence and vandalism are never okay, and the people who are responsible for this attack will be held accountable in accordance with the full force of the law. I deeply condemn the actions of those involved, and I'm working closely with our local police and the Federal Police to address this incident. Thank you to the Wynnum police, the Federal Police and everyone involved in the aftermath.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The clean-up and the new signage required will come at a great cost to Aussie taxpayers, most of whom will agree this is not how we have constructive discussions in our democracy. While it is becoming increasingly easy to find motives for distrust and divide, vandalism and intimidation are not forms of free speech. While I'm certainly not the first member to have been targeted, it is important that we do not normalise such behaviour. Enough is enough. Behaviour like this is un-Australian and has no place in Bonner and Australian society.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:31</span>):  The Maggie Beer Foundation has partnered with the Australian government's Department of Health and Aged Care to provide training and mentorship for those working in kitchens in residential aged-care homes. In Australia, sadly, it's estimated that 78 per cent of residents in aged care are malnourished or at risk of malnourishment. This is an appalling statistic that our government is working with the sector to reverse. That is where the Maggie Beer Foundation steps in.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Maggie Beer Foundation is battling this alarming statistic by running face-to-face training courses for cooks and chefs. Since 2014, it has been providing hands-on experience and peer-to-peer networking, and it now offers an online training module to help those in regional areas like my electorate access the training.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to say that, in my own electorate, Heathcote Health has signed up for this program. The program is open to up to 120 aged-care homes and runs until 2025. Jenny from my electorate is one of the head chefs. I met her during my recent visit to the Heathcote Health aged-care facility, and she said that her team has benefited from the program. The new menu has been welcomed by residents and is inspiring others to think about food. The Maggie Beer Foundation is an amazing success, and I encourage other aged-care homes to tap into the program.</span>

Since the event's inception by former Prime Minister Tony Abbott in 1998, Pollie Pedal has covered over 25,000 kilometres and raised around $7 million for charities dedicated to a range of things, including supporting our veterans.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year we raised just over a quarter of a million dollars for the Wandering Warriors. It's a remarkable organisation dedicated to providing life-changing support and opportunities for our special forces veterans and their families. By raising funds, we're not only honouring the service of these courageous men and women but also supporting programs that offer mental health support, employment assistance and, most importantly, educational support—critical resources that allow our veterans and their families to build fulfilling lives after service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every year it's a privilege to be part of Pollie Pedal. Not only is it fantastic to be on the road with current and former parliamentary colleagues and some of our former special forces veterans, but it's also great to meet people right across this country, from all walks of life, and see the wonderful work they're doing. Thank you so much to everyone who sponsored us. Twenty-six years on, this fantastic initiative continues to make a real difference to the lives of Australians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:34</span>):  I know you aren't supposed to have favourite children, but I have to say that, of all my election commitments, the health ones are my favourite. The urgent care clinic at Marion opened just over a year ago and has seen over 11½ thousand patients. That's 11½ thousand fewer people in Flinders Medical Centre ED, and they're being seen quickly and bulk-billed. The endometriosis and pelvic pain clinic at Thrive medical practice in Glenelg is, well, thriving! It's serving patients from all over Adelaide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our major tertiary hospital, Flinders Medical Centre, is 50 years old and it looks it. The Albanese Labor government has partnered with the Malinauskas Labor government for an upgrade of Flinders and the adjacent repat hospital. The end result will be an additional 150 beds, a new emergency department, a new eye surgery unit and much more. Already, over 46 beds have been opened. At Flinders, this was through repurposing office and administration spaces into clinical spaces. At repat, it has meant the rebuild of the geriatric evaluation and management unit, or GEM unit. The Margaret Tobin inpatient mental health service is being built and expanded, with double the beds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Added to this is the tripling of the Medicare bulk-billing incentive, which has meant an increase of four per cent in bulk-billing in Boothby, and cheaper medicines. This is transformational for health care in Boothby. And these are a few of my favourite things.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:36</span>):  I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge three champions of the Sunshine Coast veteran community who have unfortunately passed away over the last couple of months. Bernie Verwayen OAM was a survivor of the HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Voyager</span> incident, Australia's worst peacetime naval disaster. He led a decades-long fight for justice in a landmark legal case, and I'm going to be talking about Bernie in a few moments, in my next 90-second speech.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Erica Costigan OAM was a tireless advocate for veterans, campaigning for the commemoration of the Australian Hospital Ship <span style="font-style:italic;">Centaur</span>, which was sunk by the Imperial Japanese Navy in 1943, claiming 268 lives just off the coast of Caloundra.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Adrian Nall was a World War II veteran who defended Australians along the Kokoda Track. I joined him for his 103rd birthday just a few weeks ago. It was very sad to see him pass away just a couple of weeks ago, and it was very special for me to be able to be there. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:37</span>):  I rise to recognise the achievements of an outstanding local Brassall woman, Annabelle Johnstone. Annabelle was awarded the Churchill fellowship just a few weeks ago for her outstanding work with people who have been impacted by natural disasters. She is a practitioner of human and social recovery, with 20 years experience in guiding individuals, families and communities through days and weeks of immediate relief to long-term recovery, reconstruction and resilience. Annabelle is currently in Quilpie, and she has been visiting remote locations such as Charleville and Cunnamulla, working with local disaster-management groups as they meet, plan and undertake exercises. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Annabelle has played a critical role in coordinating human and social support services following some of Queensland's biggest disasters. She was recognised for her work in the 2011 Brisbane floods with the National Emergency Medal in the Australian honours. These floods cemented her passion for disaster recovery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Annabelle's prize of the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust fellowship will send her to the United States of America to further study the human and social impacts of disasters on aged-care facilities and their residents, to identify best-practice models and plans that could be adapted for use in Australia. She wants to ensure that older Australians living in residential aged care and retirement villages or at home are as safe as possible. It's her ambition to ensure we do evacuations and disaster management involving older people better. Congratulations, Annabelle. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:39</span>):  On 10 February 1964, HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Voyager</span> was struck by HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Melbourne</span> in manoeuvres off Jervis Bay. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Melbourne</span> cut the <span style="font-style:italic;">Voyager</span> in half, sending the <span style="font-style:italic;">Voyager</span> to the bottom of the ocean in just a few short moments, and of the 314 ADF personnel, 82 tragically lost their lives. One of the people on board HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Voyager</span> was a constituent of mine, Bernie Verwayen. For all the lawyers listening to this, you might remember that name: Verwayen v Commonwealth.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">For nearly 30 years, Bernie Verwayen fought the Commonwealth in what was an incredibly unfair position that the Commonwealth took. That case took on a special precedent in the principle of what we now call 'equitable estoppel'. The Commonwealth basically made a representation from which it then sought to resile. He took it all the way to the High Court and won. He was a man who took on the might of the Commonwealth of Australia and one. I was really proud to call Bernie a friend. He was a great servant of the country and his community in Mooloolah, where I'm very proud to live today. I want to say vale to Bernie Verwayen and thank you, Anita, for being such a good mate to him.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:40</span>):  Today I want to acknowledge the hard work of officers at the Ryde Police Area Command in ensuring the safety and wellbeing of the community of Bennelong. Recently, locals have been contacting me concerned about crime. Many have shared their experiences in reporting these crimes to Ryde Police Area Command. In response to this, it was great to read that Ryde Police Area Command ramped up their efforts to fight crime in my region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In early November, the Ryde Police Area Command carried out operation RIPCORD, a two-day blitz across the area. Over the two days, this operation resulted in 14 arrests and 20 charges across a range of offences. The operation's approach was to enforce bail conditions, ensuring compliance with domestic violence orders, expecting licensed premises and increasing high visibility patrols. This demonstrated that the police area command are responding directly to community concerns. Importantly, 61 bail enforcement checks and 163 apprehended domestic violence order compliance checks were conducted, showing that our local police are ensuring that existing offenders are complying with the conditions of orders issued upon them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many in our area are concerned about crime and I encourage them all to report these matters to police. The more reports there are, the more resources that police can allocate to our region. As always, if a resident has concerns, my office and I are here to assist.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:42</span>):  Inner Wheel is an international women's organisation that creates friendship, service and understanding between its members. It has clubs in over 100 countries, with over 100,000 members. Inner Wheel was originally founded in Manchester for the wives and daughters of Rotarians, although no Rotary connection is now required. If you think about the Rotary symbol, there is a wheel and inside it is a smaller wheel. That is the 'inner wheel'.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Inner Wheel Australia has a major national project to promote core blood research, known as Read the Red. Last week, I had the privilege of meeting with the Inner Wheel Club of Liverpool Combined, led by Renata Lockwood as their president. Liverpool Inner Wheel is currently fundraising for a variety of local organisations, including Lifeline Macarthur and Western Sydney. We discussed many things of interest to south-west Sydney but particularly the lack of infrastructure funding, particularly the fact that this government has unfortunately taken away the rail and road infrastructure funding intended to link the south-west of Sydney to the Western Sydney Airport and then onto Bradfield City. We also discussed the cost-of-living crisis, which is really impacting south-west Sydney, as well as the cost-of-housing crisis. Inner Wheel Liverpool is certainly doing their bit to combat these crises.</span>

That's 20 per cent slashed from all student debt. Whether you undertook a degree program at the University of Newcastle, did an apprenticeship through TAFE or took out an apprentice loan scheme, you will get a 20 per cent discount off your debt. Combined with the Albanese Labor government's other measures—making indexation fairer and increasing the threshold for when you need to start repaying the debt—we're wiping close to $20 billion from student loans, benefitting more than three million Australians. That's about putting money back into the pockets of students and indeed those former students.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor are the party of education, and, when we talk about higher education, we mean both university and TAFE. We're also locking in 100,000 free TAFE places every year, because, under Labor, free TAFE is here to stay. We've introduced the legislation as a matter of urgency because we know that, after a decade of neglect under the Liberals, Australia had the second-highest labour shortages amongst the OECD, and we can't afford to go back there. Tragically, the Liberals and Nationals are refusing to back our plans to make the student loan scheme fairer, and they are refusing to support our legislation to lock in free TAFE forever. It seems some people never learn. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In actual fact, thanks to you people, there is no wool industry in Australia. It was the biggest export-earning item in the entire nation's history, for 200 years, when the then incoming Labor Keating government abolished the wool scheme. Now about 10 per cent of our sheep herd is left, if that. So why should we keep them going? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That brings us to the subject of the cyclones. If we want to grow cane, it grows very favourably where there is a lot of rainfall. Where you have a lot of rainfall, that usually involves cyclones, and the United States of America would be a good case in point. So I would answer your question that way. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The greatest governments this nation has ever seen came out of Red Ted Theodore. I'm very proud to say my family is associated with the foundations of the Labor movement. Very sadly, today the ALP stands for the exact opposite principles for which the great Theodore Labor parties were formed. The Labor Party split in two, and half went to the Country Party. That's how I ended up in this place. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me return to the issues of the cyclone and the damage. I put on record my thanks to the member for Dawson, who showed immense courage as one of the very few people that have come through this place in the 30 years I've been here who, out of the courage of his convictions, again and again voted—and it had a very traumatic effect upon him—against his party for things that he believed were the right things to do. There is really little precedent for that in this place. Anyway, he was prepared to cross the floor, so out of his commitment we got the reinsurance pool. If he and I had started voting with the opposition, then the government would have been in trouble. The government—quite rightly, and I think they thought it was a good thing to do anyway—moved the reinsurance pool, and the incoming government has been very positive towards the reinsurance pool.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reinsurance pool was founded to overcome terrorism. I hope I've got my facts right here. Thirty-five years ago there were a couple of terrorism scares in Australia, and they instituted this reinsurance pool. It had about $15 billion in it. It had never been touched for about 30 years, and we moved that the reinsurance pool cover extraordinary events in North Queensland. They don't occur very often. We have cyclones, yes, but most of them are fairly mild, and modern housing can deal with a cyclone—even a strong cyclone. The reinsurance pool was triggered for extraordinary events— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="HVO" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:51</span>):  I thank the member for Kennedy for the motion and acknowledge his strong advocacy for his constituents in North Queensland over many years. At the outset, as a fellow Queenslander whose community has been severely affected by natural disasters, I want to assure him that the Albanese Labor government is committed to improving insurance affordability for northern Australian households and businesses. Our priority is to put downward pressure on insurance costs by addressing underlying risk as a result of more intense and frequent natural hazards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was on a parliamentary committee with the now-member for Morton, who looked into this more than a decade ago. The Cyclone Reinsurance Pool is helping to put downward pressure on costs and delivering lower premiums for consumers in areas exposed to high risks of cyclones. It's backed by a $10 billion fund, and the member for Kennedy is correct in the way he put it—it came out of the terrorism legislation. It was a $10 million Australian guarantee. It's also been administered by the Australian Reinsurance Pool Corporation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's committed to making sure that that pool's effective as possible. There's an in-built review taking place in 2025, three years after commencement. It's all part of our broader efforts in terms of cost-of-living relief for people. We want to make sure there's downward pressure. To put this in context, we're talking about 3.3 million households, 220,000 small businesses and 140,000 residential strata and small commercial strata properties. That's why it's so relevant for the member for Kennedy to bring this motion, and it's a huge issue for northern Australia. This pool is just one measure in helping to take pressure off northern Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're implementing the pool as legislated by the previous government. All major insurers have joined the Cyclone Reinsurance Pool, and about 98 per cent of home insurance policies are covered. In October this year, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission reported positive early signs and only early signs that the pool is working as intended and starting to deliver savings to policyholders. That was the evidence that was given in a public hearing in Brisbane with the Joint Select Committee on Northern Australia, which looked into this as well. There were positive early signs. The impact on prices is not what people were led to believe at all by the Morrison government. During the course of that public hearing, I recall that we had people from chambers of commerce up in Townsville and elsewhere saying that they knew this wasn't going to have the impact that they were led to believe, but it has had some positive impact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Any change to the design of the pool will have to be considered as part of a comprehensive review in 2025. The House of Representatives Joint Standing Committee on Economics has looked into this, and the member for Calare and I were both on that. I was up there in Townsville and Cairns getting evidence from people. There are issues in relation to the 48-hour rule. There are issues in relation to a whole range of other factors associated with that rule. If we broaden it out, it becomes more of an issue and it could cover more of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this is important. There was a decade of neglect in natural disaster funding and a whole range of areas under the previous government. We have put a billion dollars over five years towards disaster prevention and resilience projects, through the Disaster Ready Fund, and that's really critical. In the October 2022 budget, we provided $25 million for initiatives to improve affordability issues driven by natural hazard risk. We are getting on the job of putting downward pressure on those, and we've established a hazard insurance partnership to improve data sharing between governments and insurers to better understand where to invest to reduce that risk. The House of Representatives Economics Committee, which is so ably led by Dr Dan Mulino, has made a whole series of recommendations that deal with natural disasters and floods, and I'm looking forward to the government's response. I commend that report to the member for Kennedy. It's worth having a look at what that says.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ACCC is expected to publish its third monitoring report in December this year, which I expect will provide further insights into the impact of the cyclone pool on savings for consumers in the 2023-24 period. We're going to consider the 86 recommendations from the flood insurance inquiry to which I have referred, and we'll respond shortly. We know this is an important issue for all of northern Australia, and we know that the member for Kennedy is passionate about it. As a Queenslander, so am I.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:56</span>):  I rise to join the member for Kennedy and, indeed, the member for Blair in wanting to ensure that the cyclone reinsurance pool is effective and delivers meaningful assistance and help when disaster strikes in Queensland, northern Australia and, in particular, North Queensland, which the member for Kennedy is proud to represent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am from central western New South Wales, but our area is all too familiar with natural disasters and how hard they hit, often without much warning, leaving enormous devastation and tragedy where homes and, sadly, lives are lost as well. It was only last Friday that my constituents and I paused to remember the two-year anniversary of the 2022 floods, which devastated communities right around our electorate, particularly through the local government area of Cabonne but also in places like Wellington. It was a very sad commemoration, and we had a very poignant service, a small service, to remember the lives lost in Eugowra on that fateful day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Blair points out, the House Economics Committee has handed down its report on the inquiry into the insurers' responses to the 2022 major floods. The report is called <span style="font-style:italic;">Flood failure to future fairness</span>, and there was quite a bit of evidence taken during the inquiry stage as to the effectiveness of the cyclone reinsurance pool. The inquiry looked at the views of stakeholders, consumer groups and councils on the feasibility of the reinsurance pool for flood. The Australian Consumers Insurance Lobby proposed the Australian government commission an inquiry into the feasibility of establishing a federal flood reinsurance pool, and Disaster Legal Help Victoria believed that the Australian government should seriously consider government supported reinsurance pools, like the cyclone pool. Indeed, Ballina Shire Council recommended that governments investigate options to provide a reinsurance scheme for areas that the insurance market is no longer able to cover at affordable prices. The Financial Rights Legal Centre, CHOICE, the Consumer Action Law Centre and Westjustice urged the inquiry to consider whether measures such as widespread subsidies or an expanded government reinsurance pool should cover flood as well, and this was echoed by Legal Aid Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the recommendations that the committee made was that the Australian government consider measures to improve the affordability of flood insurance for existing policyholders with high-flood-risk properties, including the appropriateness of a government supported reinsurance arrangement. It's clear that there is strong appetite amongst stakeholders and residents around Australia for reinsurance pools, but, as the member for Kennedy has pointed out, we need to make sure that these pools are effective and that they will deliver the required results. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the member for Kennedy on his interest in this topic. It is of massive interest to his constituents and many in his area, and I think it's vitally important that the pool is effective and it does deliver affordable insurance coverage for affected residents. The member for Kennedy has stated that 50 per cent of households in northern Queensland are either uninsured or underinsured. This is a very concerning statistic that the member of Kennedy has brought to this House. It highlights the need for vigilance, with respect to the reinsurance pool, but also a commitment from the government to make sure that it is operating effectively. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm heartened by the words of the member for Blair, who served with me on that committee. He has a very strong interest in the cyclone reinsurance pool. I'm heartened by his words that the government is backing it in and that we will know more results as to its effectiveness very soon. I commend the hardworking member for Kennedy for bringing this important topic to the House, and I also commend the member for Blair not only for his words today but also for his work on the committee and the report which I have discussed earlier in my remarks. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to speak to this motion celebrating the exceptional achievements of Australia's Skillaroos at the 2024 WorldSkills competition in Lyon this September. The WorldSkills competition brings together the brightest, most talented young tradespeople from around the globe to showcase their abilities. Whether in construction, engineering, IT or the creative industries, our Skillaroos stood shoulder to shoulder with the world's elite. The competition was fierce, but our team held their own with poise, resilience and a deep sense of pride in representing our country. The talent displayed by the Skillaroos on the international stage highlights how important it is to invest in their skills and trades. The Skillaroos are both a product and proof positive of the strengths of our vocational education and training sector—when properly supported. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government's commitment to strengthening VET enables our young people to excel. Australia prides itself on being a nation that offers opportunities for all, yet, for too long, the cost of education has been a barrier for many young people and for those wanting to upskill later in life. TAFE, the backbone of our vocational system, has been a critical pathway for Australians seeking meaningful careers in critical industries like health care, construction, aged care, IT and the trades. However, the rising costs of fees have made that pathway out of reach for far too many. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor government's fee-free TAFE has already changed the lives of more than 500,000 Australians, providing cost-of-living relief and a pathway to well-paid, secure employment. Labor has a bill that will now legislate 100,000 free TAFE places each and every year. That's making our free TAFE a permanent feature nationwide in the VET sector. This ongoing investment from the Albanese Labor government will offer greater certainty to students, employers, industry, as well as state and territory governments. We want our TAFE and VET sectors to be able to respond to the challenges and seize the opportunities, shaping Australia's society, economy and environment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why Labor is establishing a net zero manufacturing centre of excellence in my electorate, at Tighes Hill TAFE. This centre will provide high-quality and responsive skills training in the clean manufacturing economy, upskilling our workforce so they can take full advantage of the opportunities that renewable manufacturing provides. Newcastle and the Hunter have a proud history of industry and manufacturing, making this the perfect place for a centre of excellence. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our positive vision of TAFE and the VET sector stands in stark contrast to the coalition's abysmal record. When we came to office, it was clear that we inherited a massive skills challenge from those opposite. In 2022, the OECD reported that Australia had the second-highest labour shortage per capita among the OECD countries. With that kind of track record, you'd be thinking that the opposition were keen to make amends, but, unfortunately, they've refused to back the Albanese Labor government's legislation for free TAFE places. Their own shadow minister has labelled the transformational policy as wasteful spending. Under the leadership of the Albanese Labor government, free TAFE is just one example of how we're putting people first.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe in a fairer Australia, where everyone has a fair chance to succeed, and where opportunity is not determined by the size of your bank account, but rather by your own hard work. Investing in a strong vocational education and training sector enables our apprentices and tradespeople to shine both at home and abroad. Skills drive the future of young people and the future of our nation. This is a belief that the Albanese Labor government and WorldSkills share. Australia is proud of our Skillaroos, who represented our world-class vocational training on the global stage. This next generation of skilled Australians is building the Australia of the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I must say how delighted the Prime Minister and I were to meet one of the recipients of a medal from that WorldSkills competition when we launched the centre of excellence in net zero manufacturing at Tighes Hill TAFE just a couple of weeks ago. That young man was full of pride and so excited about the bright, prosperous future for him and all of his colleagues at TAFE under an Albanese Labor government.</span>

                  <a href="265967" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WALLACE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:06</span>):  I love vocational education. I can say that because I was a carpenter and joiner and always will be. I was a builder—always will be—before I retrained as a barrister. I remember with some fondness my apprenticeship. For those who have done an apprenticeship, that would probably bring a smile to your face. It is an education, and Peter Mahoney, if you're ever watching this or listening to this, thank you for your guidance for nearly four years and your—shall we say—instructions. I'm a big fan of vocational education and training, I wouldn't be the person I am today but for Holmesglen College of TAFE, and I am a big fan of TAFE. I'm not afraid to say that, and I'll talk a little bit about that in a moment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm really pleased to be able to celebrate the Australian Skillaroos, who've returned from the 47th WorldSkills competition. In September, Australia's best young skilled apprentices and trainees took on 86 other countries, competing for the title of the world's most skilled country. We saw trainees and apprentices in carpentry, plumbing, cybersecurity, fashion design, baking and so many other fields, showcasing their expertise and the strength of Australia's vocational training sector. Congratulations to all competitors, coaches and supporters; you did Australia proud.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's that sector which myself and members of this side of the house have fought for. The coalition handed the Albanese government a skills and training system not just trending up but powering ahead, thanks to years of strong economic leadership and future-focused investment. We invested over $13 billion in skills over the final two years of government alone, representing the most significant reforms to vocational training in over a decade. Trade apprentices in training hit record highs in the final months of the coalition government, reaching 429,000 apprentices and trainees in training and 277,900 commencements as at June 2022.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were upskilling Australians to meet the challenges and opportunities of the future, but let's take a look at the government's record in comparison. On current measures, we still need 130,000 skilled trade workers to get the construction workforce to where it needs to be. This gap is worsening, with a collapse in construction apprenticeship completions of 8.6 per cent and a collapse in commencements of nearly 12 per cent. Since Labor took office, Australia has had 85,000 fewer apprentices and trainees. That's a loss of one in five. Almost all the gains the coalition made in building up Australia's skills pipeline have been squandered in just two and a half years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, through the fee-free TAFE policy, Labor are trying to put all their eggs in one basket, directing funds to just one section of the training sector—at the expense of the private sector—and rejecting the industry-based private training industry, just like they did last time. And for what? Labor's own data shows that just 13 per cent of fee-free TAFE students have completed their programs to date. That means there are just as many people dropping out as there are graduating. Also, questioning of departmental officials at Senate estimates uncovered that there has been no performance review of fee-free TAFE and that a performance review will not be completed until June 2025. This means that Labor are committing to permanently funding a $1.5 billion program without knowing if it's even working effectively. This is just another example of Labor blowing taxpayers' money on policy thought bubbles and avoiding transparency for their failures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the final few seconds that I've got to speak, I want to send a big shout-out to anybody who is thinking, as they're finishing school, 'Do I do a trade, or do I go to uni?' These are really important decisions that you're making right now, but I want you to know that if you do an Australian trade—I don't want to give an ironclad guarantee—you will virtually always have work. Australian trades are highly respected around the world. You can work in London. You can work in just about every other country. Our skills and our trades are highly respected, and they are well paid—even better than many people who are coming out of university. You don't have to go to university; you can get a trade. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:12</span>):  The WorldSkills competition brings together the most talented vocational students and apprentices from across the globe to showcase their skill, precision and passion for their chosen field. Twenty-nine young and incredibly talented Australians represented our country in September and competed at WorldSkills in Lyon, France. Our Skillaroos were put through their paces and earned their green and gold through a series of regional competitions and a national championship series. The Illawarra was a stand-out region, with four representatives honing their skills on the world stage: Michael Bowen, Joseph Cramp, Ethan Everett and Hannah Gerritsen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First up, Michael Bowen represented Australia in industrial mechanics. Michael's journey into industrial mechanics started at a TAFE open day, where a display sparked his curiosity for understanding how things work. He quickly honed his practical skills and deepened his knowledge of mechanical systems through home based education, which focused on a more hands-on approach to learning. Michael was driven by a passion to not only showcase his skills but also learn from peers around the world and strengthen his understanding of the field.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For our second contestant, Joseph Cramp, his journey into construction steelwork was influenced by both his father, who was a mechanic, and his metalwork classes in high school. Encouraged by his TAFE teacher to participate in WorldSkills, Joseph embraced the opportunity, which led to a rapid growth in his skills. He dedicated significant time to training, balancing full-time work with intensive practice sessions. With the guidance and support of his mentors and family, he was able to manage full-time work and the intense training required to compete on the world stage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next two incredibly talented people not only represented the Illawarra but also proudly flew the flag for our electorate of Cunningham. Ethan Everett's passion for bricklaying is deeply rooted in his family, with his father serving as a seasoned WorldSkills judge and volunteer. Transitioning from school to an apprenticeship, Ethan found his true calling through hands-on experience, supported by a network of family and his employer. Ethan's dedication to excellence was evident when he secured gold at the national competition. He was mentored by Andrew Hosking, who instilled the philosophy to fight for every single millimetre. With this philosophy, Ethan obtained a Medallion for Excellence. The Medallion for Excellence is awarded to competitors who achieve scores above a global benchmark, indicating that Ethan's skills are among the best in the world. Ethan aspires to become a WorldSkills ambassador, inspiring young tradespeople to pursue their passions with similar determination to his. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last but not least, Hannah Gerritsen represented us in hairdressing. Hannah developed a passion for hairdressing watching online tutorials, and her very supportive friends and family let her practice the techniques she watched. Due to the unwavering support of her employer along with her TAFE teacher, Hannah gained greater confidence in her abilities and took the French competition by storm. Despite facing scepticism for choosing an apprenticeship over traditional schooling, Hannah remained focused and improved her abilities, drawing on strength from her parents and industry mentors. She values the deep connection she gets to form with clients, appreciating the trust they place in her craft and the solace they find in her company. Hannah was a cut above the rest and claimed a Medallion for Excellence for her exceptional work during the competition in Lyon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Michael, Joseph, Ethan and Hannah, congratulations on representing our country and our region so proudly. The success of all of our Skillaroos not only highlights the incredible skill and dedication of these young Australians but also emphasises the critical importance of vocational education and training in our country. It is through initiatives like these that we have seen the true value of investing in vocational education, ensuring that we have a skilled workforce capable of driving our economy forward. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why the Albanese Labor government is committed to supporting TAFE and expanding opportunities for Australians through vocational education. We have already delivered on our commitment of 500,000 fee-free TAFE places, and now a re-elected Albanese Labor government will continue this investment with a further 100,000 fee-free places made available each and every year. By making TAFE more accessible, we are not only supporting individuals but also addressing critical skill shortages in industries that are vital to Australia's future. Congratulations, Michael, Joseph, Ethan and Hannah.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:17</span>):  Getting vocational education right is critically important because it can change lives. I want to acknowledge some of the young people who through vocational education are doing outstanding things, and they are being recognised locally. Then what I want to do is talk about an area where sadly, if we don't see an investment in vocational education, we are going to see medical services across Australia—in particular, in south-west Victoria—suffer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, first, let's have a look at the positive. Kasey Smith, an electrotechnology apprentice, was named the Apprentice of the Year at South West TAFE's annual trade awards night on 24 October. Well done, Kasey. More than 260 people attended the awards night to acknowledge the outstanding achievements of students across automotive, carpentry, cabinet-making, electrical, engineering and plumbing trades. As I said, Kasey was the overall winner, employed by Bega Group in Koroit, one of our large dairy manufacturers. South West TAFE chief executive officer Mark Fidge said that it was very important to recognise the skills of these students in the region. 'Awards like these highlight the amazing things our trade students and their employers are doing in our own communities,' he said. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other major award winners included the Automotive Apprentice of the Year, Dominic Knuckey Holswich, so well done to Dominic. The Carpentry Apprentice of the Year went to Lachlan King. Well done to Lachlan. It was fantastic to see that Fabrication Engineering Apprentice of the Year went to Barry Powell. Jakeb Jones got the Mechanical Engineering Apprentice of the Year, and the Plumbing Apprentice of the Year went to Brad Williams from South West Roofing in Warrnambool. So, to all those award winners, a huge thank you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That brings me to the next issue, and that is an issue which I have created a petition on. I will be sending this petition to the petitions office. What it does is recognise that if we don't see further vocational funding for dermatology services in regional and rural Australia then, sadly, we're going to see services in those areas begin to diminish. WPRS Dermatology in my electorate is one of only two accredited dermatology training places in a regional setting. However, the high costs associated with establishing, employing and supporting trainees means that they can no longer privately fund these positions unless there is additional funding provided. The provision of STP funding, which is used to do this, has already improved dermatology services in south-west Victoria. What WPRS is urging the minister for health to do is to formally request the department direct the Australasian College of Dermatologists to redistribute STP funding to support regional positions in 2025 and beyond, because, without this funding, our regional training positions will be at risk, leading to even longer wait times for patients and jeopardising the overall sustainability of the services that WPRS offers due to burnout and fatigue experienced by our consultant specialists.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask the government to look seriously at this issue, and this petition—which I'll be giving to the petition office—is signed by 76 doctors and has a total of 609 signatures on it. So there is full recognition that this is an incredibly important issue in particular by the medical specialists themselves. I ask the government and I ask the minister for health to, please, look at this issue, and in particular, say to the Australasian College of Dermatologists: 'You have to redistribute this STP funding in a way that also supports regional positions.' We cannot have all our dermatology services in our capital cities. We've got to make sure that they're accessible right across our nation and particularly in south-west Victoria.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:22</span>):  I thank the member for Newcastle for bringing this motion forward. I'd like to acknowledge and honour the remarkable accomplishments of Australia's Skillaroos, who represented our country at the 2024 WorldSkills competition in Lyon, France. This prestigious event is not just a competition; it is a showcase of talent, skill and dedication that reflects the very best of what Australia has to offer on the global stage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Skillaroos, a team of 32 talented young apprentices and trainees, embarked on this journey with passion and commitment. They competed against over 1,500 participants from 75 countries in a variety of fields, including plumbing, carpentry, baking, cybersecurity and fashion design. Their hard work culminated in an impressive performance that saw Australia ranked 14th out of 59 countries and earning a bronze medallion in welding along with 14 medallions for excellence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This achievement is a testament not only to their individual talents but also to the rigorous training and preparation they underwent to reach this level of excellence. The dedication, skill and passion exhibited by our Skillaroos exemplify the high standards of vocational education and training in Australia. These young individuals have shown us that hard work and determination can achieve greatness. Their success at the WorldSkills competition highlights the incredible talent within our skilled workforce—talent that is crucial for driving innovation and economic growth in our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is essential to recognise that these achievements do not happen in isolation. They are the result of a robust vocational education system that nurtures young talent. The Skillaroos have benefited from quality training programs that equip them with the skills needed to excel in their respective fields. This is a clear indication of the importance of investing in vocational education, as it lays a foundation for future successes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we celebrate these achievements, we must also commend the Albanese Labor government for its unwavering commitment to improving access to vocational education and training. By prioritising initiatives such as fee-free TAFE, we are ensuring that all Australians have the opportunity to pursue their passions without financial barriers. This initiative is vital for creating a skilled workforce that meets the demands of our evolving economy. The Albanese Labor government's focus on putting TAFE back at the heart of our vocational education system is a step in the right direction. TAFE institutions play a crucial role in providing high-quality training that prepare students for real-world challenges. By supporting these institutions, we are not only investing in individual futures but also fostering a culture of excellence that benefits our entire community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we look ahead, it is imperative that we continue to support the government's efforts to invest in our people through training initiatives. The Skillaroos have demonstrated what can be achieved when we harness talent and provide opportunities for growth. It is our responsibility to ensure that future generations have access to similar pathways. We must advocate for ongoing investment in vocational education and training programs that empower young Australians. By prioritising initiatives like fee-free TAFE, we can create an inclusive environment where everyone has the chance to succeed. This commitment will not only benefit individuals but also strengthen our economy by cultivating a skilled workforce ready to meet future challenges.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us take this moment to celebrate the exceptional achievements of Australia's Skillaroos at the 2024 WordSkills competition. Their dedication serves as an inspiration to us all, a reminder of what can be accomplished through hard work, passion and commitment to excellence. Let us also recognise the vital role of vocational education and training in shaping our future. Together, we will support initiatives that empower young Australian to pursue their dreams without barriers. By investing in our people today, we are securing a brighter tomorrow for all Australians.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="263547" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:27</span>):  It's such a privilege to stand in support of this motion from the member for Newcastle to celebrate our awesome Skillaroos. For me, it's particularly exciting given that one of the Skillaroos is from my electorate of Corangamite in Victoria. Trey McAuley is a carpenter from Bannockburn studying at Gordon TAFE. He has amazing talent, and I'm so proud that he had the opportunity to represent our country at the WorldSkills games in Lyon, France, earlier this year. Trey represented Australia alongside 28 other young Australians at the largest international skills competition in WorldSkills history, with more than 1,400 competitors and 1,300 experts from over 70 countries taking part. Competing to be the best in your field can be stressful, but, according to the team at Gordon TAFE, if there's anyone who knows how to keep cool in a high-pressure environment it's Trey. Trey said in a recent interview:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Being a volunteer firefighter and serving my community have really shaped me as a person and helped me to be my best while competing at WorldSkills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The WorldSkills competition showcases Australian vocational education and training internationally and puts centre stage the government's mission to continue strengthening our world-class VET sector. The Skillaroos are the product and walking proof of the strengths of our VET sector. They demonstrate the life-changing benefits of TAFE for so many Australians, like Trey. That's why the Albanese government is continuing its investment in the skills that Australia needs to drive economic growth, address workplace shortages and provide pathways for more people to pursue a career as a tradie, carer or IT professional.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's why we've introduced the Free TAFE Bill. The bill will ensure free TAFE is a national and enduring program. Ongoing free TAFE will offer greater certainty to students, employers and industry. It's what our communities have been calling for, and it's what the Albanese government is delivering. Free TAFE is targeting the sectors that desperately need skilled workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's growing from strength to strength every day, giving young people and those wanting to transition access to new skills and to gaining accreditation. Fee-free TAFE started in January 2023 and it's exceeded all expectations, with more than 508,000 enrolments, including 131,000 in care, including disability and aged care, 48,900 in digital and tech, 35,000 in construction and 35,500 in early childhood education and care. This is groundbreaking and the result shows fee-free TAFE is particularly benefiting Australians from priority cohorts, with over 170,000 young Australians, 124,000 jobseekers and 30,000 First Nations Australians enrolling in the program. For all fee-free TAFE places, six in 10 have been taken up by women. One in three are based in regional or remote Australia. Almost 90 per cent of fee-free TAFE courses are full qualifications at the certificate III level and above. These courses take longer to complete, as long as three years for full-time study and more for those who elect to study part time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government's 2024-25 budget delivers $600 million in measures to bolster skills growth and development in the clean energy, industry, construction and manufacturing sectors as well as support apprentices and break down barriers for women in male dominated industries. This includes $91 million over five years in the budget to help skill the new energy workforce to transition to net zero, $90 million over three years to help skill the housing and construction workforce, $55 million over four years for building women's career programs and $265 million over four years to target support under the Australian apprenticeship incentives scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, TAFE serves as a cornerstone of opportunity, a catalyst for personal growth and a foundation for better, brighter futures for so many young Australians right across our nation. Our government recognises this. It's why we're backing free TAFE, and it's why we're backing young aspirational Australians, like Trey, to be the leaders of our nation's future workforce.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am prompted to do this because, last week, the member for Maribyrnong, the Minister for Government Services, delivered a speech which he billed as containing a stocktake of his achievements in the government services portfolio. It turns out that the Minister for Government Services, when he comes to assess his own performance, gives himself a very high mark. He didn't put it in exactly these terms, but certainly when I was at Sydney university it went from pass to credit to distinction to high distinction. I think it's pretty clear that the Minister for Government Services regards himself as being worthy of a high distinction. He had this to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When I took over the portfolio it was obvious that staffing cuts—thousands of jobs being abolished—had left the Agency unable to meet customer expectations …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By the way, he was referring to those dreadful Liberals who had done this. He said further:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I fought very hard to get Services Australia properly resourced and was able to secure record funding in this year's Budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the basis on which it seems he would award himself very high marks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I think it's worth taking a look at the facts, because the facts are rather different to the revisionist construction which the minister has put on what occurred. If you look at what happened in the May 2023 budget, when the Minister for Government Services was on the job, the resourcing to Services Australia wasn't increased; it was reduced. It was reduced to $8.593 billion. The average staffing level was not increased but cut to $26,692.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that the member for Maribyrnong likes to put the best possible construction on things, and you'd be naive to take what he said at face value. But I have to say, this is a particularly remarkable exercise in rewriting history. Because the simple fact is that, under the member for Maribyrnong, the performance of Services Australia has gone backwards. The reason is that the minister, the member for Maribyrnong, has been applying the wrong policy tools. In 2021-22, when 'those dreadful Liberals', to use his language, were in government, it took on average 35 days to process a claim for an age pension. For the period 1 January 2024 to 1 May 2024, the average time was 84 days. So processing time has gone from 35 days to 84 days; it has gone from reasonable to terrible. At the same time, we saw a change in the number of people sitting in the customer delivery group from 20,902 to 23,324. So the number of people in the customer delivery service group went up, and the actual quality of the customer service delivery went through the floor. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've heard a range of excuses from the minister over the last couple of years. There has been an argument that we've seen an increase in customer demand. That's not true! Customer demand in 2021-22 was 126 million. Customer demand in 2023-24 was 92 million. It went from 126 million to 92 million, so demand dropped. The number of claims that were made in 2021–22 were 517 million, and in 2023-24 there were 468 million. Let's be clear, the number of claims dropped, and yet the processing time got worse. Under the coalition, Services Australia had a smaller headcount and more claims to deal with. It faced higher customer demand and delivered better outcomes. Under the member for Maribyrnong, the number of staff has blown out remarkably, and yet the service performance has gone through the floor. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the member for Maribyrnong's solution? It's to splurge yet more money. There is $1.8 billion now committed for an extra 7,500 public servants. We've seen the trend—more public servants mean services reducing. On that trend, if that continues, the 7,500 additional public servants will not make things better but worse. Frankly, the member for Maribyrnong has done a truly dismal job, and, critically, in trying to run Services Australia in the 21st century, he's been using discredited 19th-century approaches. He wants to throw more staff at the problem. What he needs to do, amongst other things, is do a much better job on the digital service delivery. Service New South Wales under the coalition government showed the way. This minister has not been listening. Australians deserve better. The member for Maribyrnong has given himself a very high mark. Most objective observers would disagree very strongly. </span>

                  <a href="263547" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:38</span>):  I acknowledge that the member for Bradfield is raising his concerns on behalf of those in our communities who use Services Australia. But he has completely failed to acknowledge the dedication, commitment and hard work that our frontline Services Australia workers put in each and every day. This motion also highlights an underlying disrespect that many in the coalition have for public servants who are our frontline service workers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Services Australia is home to some of the most dedicated and compassionate workers across our nation. After a decade of neglect, the Albanese Labor government is working hard to once again empower Australia's most vulnerable and give them access to the services they deserve. Under the Albanese government, we are reducing wait times, and we are investing $1.8 billion dollars into Services Australia. We are doing this because, under the coalition, vulnerable people were often waiting far too long, often anxious and frustrated, and for good reason. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The facts do speak for themselves. Between 2015 to 2022, the former coalition government ripped 3,800 frontline worker staff out of Services Australia and the department. This coincided with their cruel and illegal robodebt scheme. We know they were also planning to cut another 2,700 staff between 2021 and 2023. The now opposition wants to cut jobs and services even further, with 36,000 job cuts, around 20 per cent of the Public Service. What does this mean? Australians would be forced to wait longer for their pension, paid parental leave, childcare subsidies, Medicare and the processing of veterans claims, reversing the improvements Australians have seen as a result of our government's investments. In contrast, the coalition in government would continue to spend big on consultants, costing the taxpayer more in the end. The last time they did this it led to backlogs across Services Australia, veterans claims, visa processing and passport processing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is taking a different approach. In the most recent budget, the Albanese government invested $1.8 billion into Services Australia to maintain a customer service workforce and to deliver timely services and payments to Australians who are doing it tough with the cost of living. This is really important work. To make this a reality, there will be an additional 4,030 staff next financial year and more than 3,500 extra staff in 2025-26. The additional staff will better position the agency to meet government and community expectations of timely service delivery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This follows the investment in November 2023, when, in a record 10 weeks, 3,000 additional frontline staff were onboarded into the agency and trained to accelerate claims and processing times and improve access for customers. It was amazing, cutting the backlog of nearly a million Centrelink and Medicare claims to usual levels by mid-financial year, which helped to bring down call wait times and congestion messages towards the most recent financial year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the first quarter of 2024-25, the agency finalised almost 124 million claims, exceeding our target. Compared to this time last year, processing times have reduced by 32 days for aged-care claims, 16 days for the childcare subsidy, 24 days for disability support pension claims, 41 days for Medicare eligibility and enrolment, and 81 days for Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme patient refunds. This work changes lives. We know that reducing outstanding claims is helping to bring down call wait times as fewer people contact the agency regarding the process of their claim. We've also seen call wait times improve by more than 17 minutes for Medicare customers and 10 minutes for Centrelink customers. Additionally, most customers are being served within 15 minutes at 318 service centres across Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear that the Albanese government is investing in the right areas. We're backing in Services Australia; we're funding more staff for Services Australia, particularly in regional areas, and we're cutting wait times so that Australians can access the services they need and deserve.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:43</span>):  I thank the member for Bradfield for bringing this important issue before the chamber by way of this motion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like any member of parliament here in the room, I obviously deal with a copious number of constituents that have issues accessing the government services they are duly entitled to. Certainly, matters regarding Services Australia are one of the higher volume categories of cases that come through my office, and I'm sure it's quite similar for most members.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Bradfield outlined some very concerning statistics around the performance of processing claims within Services Australia, comparing the last year of our coalition government with the most recent year under the new Labor government. Unfortunately, all the numbers are going the wrong way. The staffing is up, the efficiency of processing is down and, of course, people aren't getting the support they are entitled to from their government, because they're waiting far too long.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the recent budget, we saw a dramatic increase in the size of the Public Service; 36,000 more public servants are being employed under this government compared to the last year under the coalition. We are certainly not getting 36,000 people's worth of efficiency at Services Australia; that's for sure. It's really galling to people wanting the efficient delivery of government services, those that are waiting for their duly entitled claims to be processed and, frankly, any taxpayer that wants us to have an efficient system that gives people the support that they deserve, processes it in a timely matter and makes sure government can be as efficient as possible. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The new government are bragging about increasing the number of people being employed at Service Australia. I don't know if that's something to be proud of if the performance is commensurately deteriorating at the same time. As the member for Bradfield pointed out, while the size of the workforce has gone up by a couple of thousand, the efficiency in processing and the outcomes for people that matter, when it comes to engaging government resources, are going backwards; the people entitled to it are missing out. Something is really wrong when more people are achieving poorer outcomes in processing those claims. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Bradfield is quite right that there are good ways and bad ways to increase the resources that go towards government service delivery, particularly at Services Australia. I agree with him in commending the former coalition government in New South Wales and the way in which they engaged in digital service delivery and created dramatic efficiencies across a number of government services through their digital government agenda. It's a model that is very worthy of reflecting upon, one that would be good for our Commonwealth government to look at in terms of ways of investing so that people have the best modern experience when it comes to their interaction with the government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, we all deal with individual cases that can be quite complex with Services Australia, with immigration matters, with the NDIS et cetera. It's always very reasonable to respect and understand that there will be at times quite complex matters that need bespoke service delivery and might have a complexity that means that it's not that easy to quickly and rapidly process. But the vast majority should sit within an efficient framework and should indeed be achieving reduced wait times through the performance metrics, particularly as investment in the processing of the claims goes up. They shouldn't be going backwards, like they are right now. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That means that the policy decisions of this government are making are an absolute embarrassment of what they could be and should be achieving for some of the most vulnerable people in our society. So swallow the pride, admit you've got it wrong and look for opportunities to change course and see a focus on policy delivery in Services Australia that is actually going to deliver for some of the most vulnerable people in our society, because right now they're being let down by the performance of this government. They're the ones that need good government more than anyone at all. Instead, they're getting these terrible outcomes from Services Australia. We would like to see the government dramatically improve their performance in this amongst many other areas. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:49</span>):  For those opposite and for this particular shadow minister, the member for Bradfield, to bring forward this motion is just absolutely unbelievable. To hear the former speaker, the member for Sturt, talking about Australians who are accessing Services Australia being let down by this government—it just beggars belief that these people would say things like that when they are the party of robodebt, the party of Centrelink closures, the party that took the human out of human services, the party that gave us great lines like 'lifters not leaners' and the disaster budget of 2014, which attempted to absolutely rip the guts out of our social security system. If a lot of those things had got through, it would have left people in such a dire state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a party, those opposite, that do not value these things whatsoever. This is a party that has the temerity to come into this House and criticise the government for how Services Australia is run, when, since our election in 2022, what we have been trying to do is rebuild Services Australia into an organisation that is fit to actually deliver the services that Australians need. We have been doing that work, led by the minister, Bill Shorten, who came in after a decade of mismanagement by the coalition had left it in ruins.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The mover of this motion, the member for Bradfield, actually had to give evidence to a royal commission about the mismanagement of Human Services under his and his colleagues' watch. In her report, the commissioner relayed the human consequences of that neglect—families struggling to make ends meet receiving debt notices on Christmas, young people being driven to despair by demands for payments by private debt collectors and even the tragic suicide of Australians who had false Centrelink debts raised against them. This track record was known early. In 2017, people began raising the alarm. The response of those opposite was to double-down and go on the attack against people who complained. They cried with righteous indignation against what they saw as the undeserving ripping off taxpayers, but, as we know, these debts were not only incorrect; they were punitive. The ferocity with which the Liberal government went after vulnerable Australians serves as a lesson to never trust these people with a social security system, because, as I said, they do not believe in it, they do not recognise its value and they will only strive to cut it and to undermine the people that access it. What they did through robodebt was not only immoral and heartless; it was also illegal. That they want to come in here and criticise us with that track record is unbelievable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, our government has been rebuilding Services Australia and trying to restore trust with the Australians who access it. Make no mistake: if those opposite were to get back into government, they would undo all that work, because the fundamentals of their beliefs remain the same. We've just heard from the member for Sturt how terrible it is that we've actually increased staff, that we've actually employed more people at Services Australia to deliver those services. That's what these people think is a problem—more public servants delivering services to the public. They despise our social safety net and those who rely on it. Whether it's Medicare or social security payments, it doesn't matter—you can be sure that they're out to gut the services Australians hold dear.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is our track record? Since coming to government, we have cleared the extensive backlog of claims. In this year's budget, we invested $1.8 billion into Services Australia. Last year, we employed 3,000 additional frontline staff to accelerate claims-processing times and improve access for customers. That's right. Unlike the member for Sturt, I'm proud that we've increased staff at Services Australia, that hardworking public servants are getting the resources they need to actually support people to access our social security system. In the first quarter of this year, Services Australia finalised almost 124 million claims, with over 90 per cent processed within standard timeframes, which exceeded our target. The average processing time for the age pension was reduced by 32 days. There was a reduction of 32 days. For the childcare subsidy it has been reduced by 16 days to an average of eight days. For the disability support pension, claims now take on average 24 days less than they did under the previous government. And I could go on because across a range of different payments we have cut processing times because we are rebuilding Services Australia, which they destroyed with 10 years— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300123" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WARE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:53</span>):  I rise to speak on this motion brought by the member for Bradfield. I thank him for doing so. I note that he is absolutely committed to a better system of service for Services Australia. I was here for the tail end of the member for Canberra's speech. I have tremendous respect for the member for Canberra, but, with all due respect, I think she has failed to understand the nature of the motion that has been put by the member for Bradfield and also the supporting statement given by the member for Sturt. It is not the fact that we are objecting to the number of public servants that are now employed by Services Australia. We are saying, 'What are these public servants doing?' because, by their own admission, this Albanese Labor government has vastly increased the number of public servants in this place, by around 36,000, and yet this is what we see.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are not seeing the service delivery for those public servants that have been employed. We have no objection to there being more public servants, but public servants are here to deliver services, at the end of the day. They're not here just to collect a wage, and they are largely unproductive. The very large increase in the number of public servants has of course led to inefficiencies and government waste, and the massive overspend by this government is still fuelling inflation and the cost-of-living crisis. I note that the member for Canberra has now left the chamber, but I say to the member: of course we know that public departments run on public servants. I was a public servant. I've got tremendous respect for public servants, but why is it that more and more public servants are being employed and the services are not being delivered?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we have seen in Services Australia's last annual report—the 2023-24 report to which my friend the member for Bradfield refers in his motion—customer satisfaction scores 79 out of 100, against a target of 85. That's a failure. Only 55.2 per cent of customers were served within 15 minutes, against a target of 70 per cent. The percentage of work processed within timeliness standards was 71.8 per cent, against a target of 90 per cent. Finally, only 50.5 per cent of Centrelink claims were processed within their respective timeliness standards. This is the issue that is being raised by the member for Bradfield, and this is the issue that we are speaking about. Wherever these public servants might have been employed, they have not been employed at the coalface to actually deliver results. At the end of the day, that is what the Public Service is there to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I hear this every single day from my electorate. I hear from people who have been on the phone to Centrelink. They are frustrated. They're calling my office in tears. They can't get into their myGov app, for example, or they are people that cannot use technology for whatever reason—they may be vision impaired or they may be slightly intellectually disabled—and the phone remains unanswered. This is causing tremendous stress to people who, if they are accessing these levels of government services—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DAVID SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bean</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:58</span>):  It beggars belief that the party of robodebt would trot out this nonsense. Customer experience indeed! This motion and the speeches in favour of it underscore the approach the Liberals have to the Australian Public Service and the people who work for critical organisations such as Services Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The electorate of Bean, which includes Tuggeranong, the Molonglo Valley and parts of Woden in the ACT—which I have the honour to represent in this place—is home to thousands of the staff of Services Australia, the very people caught in the crosshairs of this motion. Services Australia employs over 4,300 people in the ACT, with several workplaces in the electorate of Bean, including the Reed Street offices, the Caroline Chisholm Centre and the Louisa Lawson Building. I know and talk to hundreds of Services Australia employees. I and all my Labor colleagues understand and value the contribution they are making to this nation every day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion and the rhetoric surrounding it from the members opposite exhibits the negativity and contempt for the staff of this agency. In prosecuting this motion, the Liberals choose to cherry pick data and make out that Services Australia somehow collapsed after the Liberals left office. What nonsense! They choose to only cite data they believe makes the case that Services Australia and the people who work there are failing. The reason for this is that they want to take political points off this government and score cheap points at the expense of hard-working public servants. They ignore the reality of what is happening; they ignore the real figures that don't suit their political conspiracy, but thankfully my colleague the member for Canberra corrected the record.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All this beating up on the APS underscores one thing that we know to be true about Liberals. If the Liberals do ever get the chance to be in office again, they will rip into the APS and into Services Australia again, as they do every time they are in government. We know the consequences of that. This motion today is the entree. It sets the tone that would justify cuts and contracting out. If the Liberals get back into office, the nation would suffer again at the hands of a political party that, to its core, disrespects public servants and wants to talk them down at every turn. When they get into power, they always turn this attitude into cuts. I hope that as many residents as possible of Bean are listening to this debate. I'll certainly be bringing it to the attention of my community because it gives a real insight into what the Liberals think they will do if they get back into office. It will be bad news for Australia and bad news for the workers at Services Australia, many of whom live in my electorate of Bean.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this debate, my colleagues have been addressing the many myths in this motion about service delivery at Services Australia, but, as the member for Bean, I'll focus on what the Liberals will do to jobs here in this nation's capital and right across the nation. The Liberals want to cut jobs and services in every state and territory while spending billions on more expensive consultants and contractors. We've seen this movie before. Under the Liberals' job cuts, Australians in need will be forced to wait longer for their pension, paid parental leave, childcare subsidies, Medicare and veterans claims to be processed, reversing the improvements Australians have seen as a result of Labor's investments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals' use of consultants and contractors comes at a costly premium without offering the value for money that taxpayers expect. What does it lead to? It leads to robodebt and backlogs across Services Australia with veterans claims, visa processing and passport processing—all the issues that we have had to clean up in this term of government. In a nutshell, what does the Liberal Party want to do if it returns to government and what would it do to the actual job of government? They want to cut 36,000 jobs, which would work out to be around 20 per cent of the APS. What might that look like? It will probably look like 4,000 jobs in Services Australia, delaying payments with call wait times increasing. You'd be looking at a thousand jobs in DVA, leaving veterans without the support they deserve. You could be looking at 4,000 jobs across Defence, Home Affairs and the AFP, threatening Australia's national security, secure borders and the delivery of AUKUS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we're doing, instead, is working for Australians looking for employment, not against them as those opposite want to do with our Public Servants. If these plans are ever implemented, it would decimate both the services delivered and the employment opportunities in the electorate of Bean. I'll continue to work hard for those who turn up every day for the Public Service.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VIOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:03</span>):  This is an important motion, because, as we all know, when we talk about Services Australia, what we're actually talking about is the Australian people and those that need access to funds, whether it's the disability support pension, a low-income card or the age pension. These are Australia's most vulnerable who are needing support. I am sure every member in this house and many senators—I got an email today actually from a constituent who'd been trying to call Centrelink and hadn't been able to get through. They reached out to my office wanting support because they'd been unable to get the support they needed. Australians at their most vulnerable are looking to the government and looking for support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's understand, as with many things with Albanese Labor government, what they said before the election versus the reality of today. Let's have a look at what the then opposition leader and the then shadow minister said. They said they would 'restore dignity, humanity and competence to the delivery of government services'. That's what they claimed two and a half years ago. We're now a good chunk into the Albanese Labor government, so we can look at some data and compare what they said they'd do with what they've done, and compare that to the former coalition government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at something like disability support pension payments, which were taking an average of 40 days to process under the coalition. Under Labor, that has more than doubled to 93 days. Let's look at the age pension. Under the coalition, it was 35 days; now, under Labor, it's 76 days. Let's look at the low-income card. Under the coalition, there was a 16-day wait period; now, under Labor, it's 53 days. The average time to answer Centrelink calls, based on the department's own data, is over 30 minutes. You now have to wait 30 minutes to have your call answered—if you're lucky enough to have it answered—under this government. Compare that to the 14-minute wait under the coalition. That's why those opposite are so frustrated and needing to interject on previous speakers. They know that the statistics and the data from the department don't match the reality for the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at customer satisfaction in the 2023-24 year. The target was 85 out of 100, and they hit 79.1. Customers served within 15 minutes: the target was 70 per cent; under this government it hit 55.2 per cent. Work processed within the timeliness standards—it's very important, as we know, that those that are most vulnerable get looked after in a timely way. The standard is 90 per cent; under this government, it's 71.8 per cent. And the official data confirms that only 58 per cent of Centrelink claims were processed within their respective timeliness standards, and that's including things like the age pension, the disability support pension and the low-income card.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why we are seeing the challenges that the Australian people are facing, whether it's the cost of living, where we have the Treasurer stand up day after day in question time and tell the Australian people that they've never had it better, when they're struggling more than ever; whether it is roads, where they're saying, 'We're investing billions in roads,' and every Victorian who drives on a road, particularly in a regional and rural road in my community and many other communities, knows there are potholes everywhere; or whether it's Services Australia, where the government promised to 'restore dignity, humanity and competence to the delivery of government services'—a nice line, but they haven't delivered on it, based on their own data in the Services Australia 2023-24 annual report.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That sums up the two and a half years of the Albanese Labor government. The Prime Minister, when he was opposition leader, promised the world to the Australian people. He promised that he could solve the challenges they faced, with the cost of living and with Services Australia. He made it sound so easy. The Prime Minister made many promises that he has not delivered on, and two and half years into the Albanese Labor government Australians know they're worse off. They know they'll be worse off into the future. They know that this is a prime minister who is weak and will not deliver for the Australian people.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="295588" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GARLAND</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:08</span>):  I think it's fairly telling that the previous speaker acknowledged the need to restore dignity and competence to Services Australia, which is a pretty damning indictment, I think, on the record of the decade before the Albanese Labor government was elected. Let's get something straight: we know that the previous government treated those accessing Services Australia services with absolute contempt. This was, after all, the government that presided over the abhorrent robodebt fiasco, which ruined people's lives. This was a government that absolutely gutted the public sector. So please forgive me if I greet this motion before the House today with some cynicism. I do not believe for a second that there is a genuine shred of concern for people who have had to access Services Australia. This is just another tactic being used by those opposite to attack the record of the government, rather than work together with the government to deal with the cost-of-living pressures that people are experiencing and make sure that people are not left behind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we know that people are doing it tough. We've consistently acknowledged that and we're working hard every single day to improve the lives of Australians in every community across the country, including my own in Chisholm. Indeed, in the 2024-25 budget, our government invested $1.8 billion into Services Australia over three financial years to maintain a customer service workforce to deliver timely services and payments to Australians experiencing vulnerability in the midst of cost-of-living pressures, to sustain emergency response capability and to support other aspects of the agency's operations. We know that this investment is improving claim processing times and helping to decrease call wait times for customers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is really important, and it's not about numbers on a page. I know everyone's been quite focused on a lot of data in this conversation, but I think it's really important that we don't divorce the data from people's lives and experiences and that we acknowledge the real stress and distress that people experience when they're hoping to get in contact with Services Australia to support them through what is often a very difficult time in their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's because we understand those very real pressures and stress that people face that we have committed to putting on an additional 4,030 staff in the next financial year and 3,530 staff in the subsequent financial year. This is because we want people to be able to get the help that they need when they need it. This will help the agency to meet government and community expectations for timely service delivery. This follows investments from November last year, when, in a record 10 weeks, 3,000 additional frontline staff were progressively onboarded into the agency and trained to accelerate claim processing times and improve access for customers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the agency has now reduced claim volumes down to usual levels. We've reduced a backlog of nearly a million Centrelink and Medicare claims to usual levels. This helped to bring down call wait times and congestion messages towards the end of last year. We absolutely know that we need to do all we can to reduce processing times and to treat people with the respect and compassion they deserve. We know that reducing outstanding claims is helping to bring down call wait times, as fewer people will need to contact the agency regarding the progress of their claim. We know that we've seen improvements in terms of wait times for Medicare and Centrelink customers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our significant investment in staffing came at a really critical time, when Services Australia had fewer public servants per capita than ever before. We know the previous government ripped out thousands and thousands of frontline staff from Services Australia and its predecessor department. That was an absolute shame. We know that this coincided with the horrific, cruel and illegal robodebt scheme. Our work in government has been about focusing on improving the capacity of Services Australia and making sure that offices and staff are located in major cities across the country where people need to access them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am really disappointed that the opposition haven't worked more closely with our government to improve this situation. I hope they do in the future.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:14</span>):  We know that, currently, people are doing it tough out there, and we know that one of the hardest things that they face is prices at supermarkets. When you're on a very low wage or a pension, every single cent counts. Every time there's an increase at the supermarket, the person that feels it the most is that low-income earner or that pensioner. That's why I'm very pleased that the current government is doing all that it can to alleviate the cost-of-living problems. One of those areas is looking at the supermarkets and how they conduct themselves and how their way of selling is affecting supermarket prices. The government is going to provide $30 million in a package of additional funding for the ACCC to crack down on misleading pricing and practices and, very importantly, poor conduct from different outlets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to do more in this area. We need to ensure that the Australian consumer is getting a fair go when they walk into the supermarket. During the ACCC inquiry, we saw examples all over TV where, for example, some of these big supermarket outlets—there are only two of them, really, the two that dominate the market here in Australia—would have specials and sales with bells and whistles, only to show that those sales and special prices were actually higher than the normal prices. That is absolute misconduct on behalf of supermarkets, conning the Australian public, and it's not on. This is where the ACCC has to crack down on them and ensure that they're doing the right thing by Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that every piece of retail that's sold in this country, across the nation, is out of two outlets. When you include not just the supermarkets but the servos and liquor stores that are owned by these particular conglomerates, around 70 per cent of retail being sold in this nation comes from those two. In no other country around the world would they be allowed to operate. They would be broken down and sold off, and rightly so. It's unfortunate that we don't have laws in this country that will actually do that. In the United States, at over 40 per cent the government will step in and break you up and make you divest. The reality is that we've allowed these oligarchs to get away with it for so long.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased that the government is now doing something. There's going to be a crackdown from the ACCC to investigate the allegations to ensure that the Australian consumer is getting a fair go, especially in an economic climate like the current economic climate, where every cent counts, especially for those low-income workers, for our pensioners and for people that are doing it really tough. These reforms will make the system faster, stronger, simpler and more targeted and more transparent. It's also about more competition for consumers and more certainty and clarity for businesses. Under this new system, we'll set clear thresholds to determine whether a merger needs ACCC approval, and there are also powers to ensure all the high-risk mergers are looked at.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that currently, when you look at the price increases and what's been happening, a survey of 2,500 households in July 2024 showed that Australian households spend around $168 per week on groceries. This equates to almost $728 per month or $8,700 per year. The average weekly spending for larger households of five or more people is roughly $232, with the majority of this spent on staple or everyday food items. When we talk about staple and everyday food items, these are necessities. This isn't a luxury; this is about putting food on the table for your kids and your family and ensuring that you have the nutrition that's needed. So we need to ensure that there's a price monitoring that would look at prices continuously and that, where we see something that perhaps doesn't seem quite right, the ACCC has the power to go in, investigate and take action to ensure that we're able to keep prices down and to ensure that there's fair competition and that these big companies are doing the right thing by the consumer. The biggest increase in prices of food items recorded was for oil and fats, which were up 50 per cent over the last few years. Fruit and vegetables were up over 30 per cent. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282335" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HAINES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:19</span>):  Australians have been taken for a ride by the major supermarkets and, frankly, it's no wonder they are among Australia's least trusted companies. Coles and Woolworths, who collectively control two-thirds of the grocery sector, are among the most profitable supermarkets in the world. While families have been struggling to balance the household budget, both Coles and Woolies made more than $1 billion in after-tax profits in the previous financial year. Just swallow that fact. To rub salt into the wound, it seems like not a day passes without another story in the media about fake discounts, price gouging or mistreatment of small-scale suppliers and farmers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, in my electorate of Indi in north-east Victoria, fruitgrowers are a key part of the local agricultural sector. However, Fruit Growers Victoria have told government inquiries of the significant market failure in the provision of fresh fruit to the Australian retail sector. They blame this, in large part, on the enormous power imbalance of a sector dominated by guess who? Coles and Woolworths, the duopoly. They worry for the future of Australian grown fruit. Sadly, this is a common view across most agricultural sectors in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For most Australians, the equation is simple. Farmers are getting paid less and consumers are paying more. It's not hard to understand that that's not right. It's why Australians have had enough of the big supermarket duopoly. That's why I've supported the actions to date to rein in the supermarkets, as well as other big businesses treating regular Australians with contempt. I support inquiries into supermarket price gouging and I commend efforts to crack down on dodgy specials and fake discounts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recognise the vital role of the competition regulator in holding Coles and Woolworths accountable and protecting Australian consumers. I also support plans to make the Food and Grocery Code of Conduct mandatory. I want to see stronger protections, including whistleblower protections, for suppliers who call out the big supermarkets on their bad behaviour. I also support calls for an economy-wide divestiture power that would give the competition regulator the power to break up big businesses when it can prove regular Australians are getting a dud deal. Corporate interest should never be prioritised over consumer interest in a sector as important as fundamental food and groceries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the major parties are not blameless here. To me, their bold words ring hollow and come far too late. We only find ourselves in this situation because neither the Labor Party nor the Liberal Party and National Party have been brave enough to take on the supermarket duopoly. One duopoly in this country seems to be protecting another. For decades, they've sat by and allowed the major supermarkets to accumulate power and influence and, now, in many regional communities, a Woolies or a Coles is the only game in town.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I also can't stand is that the supermarket duopoly use their power and influence to squeeze Aussie farmers and agricultural communities. For most primary producers, whether in my electorate of Indi or right across regional Australia, it's getting harder and harder to do business without being dependent on and beholden to the market dominance of the major supermarkets. Yet for years, as political tides have ebbed and flowed, little has been done to fundamentally reform the supermarket sector. That we find ourselves in the situation we're in today is not really a surprise to those who have been watching. It was only once the conduct of the supermarkets became so egregious and so obvious that it could no longer be ignored that both major parties decided to get tough on the supermarkets. So we cannot let this moment go to waste and we must reform the grocery sector to ensure consumers and farmers are put before corporate profits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a regional independent, I will always put the interests of my community first, whether that be a family trying to put affordable food on the table or the multigenerational farming family underpinning the food security of our nation. I will always push for a fairer food system in this country where farmers and all our incredible primary producers are rewarded for their hard work, where agricultural communities are supported, not undermined. I've always pushed for a grocery sector where households—all households—can put food on the table that is healthy and affordable.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="298840" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr REPACHOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:24</span>):  I rise in support of this motion from my good friend the member for Hawke. The No.1 priority for the Albanese Labor government is cost-of-living relief. Supermarkets are a place where Australians have been feeling the squeeze every week. Supermarkets are seriously greedy. They are squeezing at both ends of the production line—squeezing consumers at the till and squeezing suppliers at the farm gate and at the factory. Enough is enough. The supermarket squeeze has gone on for too long. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Hunter, we are proud of our agricultural produce and our hardworking families. People across our electorate are feeling the supermarket squeeze as both consumers and producers. Families in our electorate shouldn't have to worry about whether they can afford the groceries they need. Our local farmers and other suppliers shouldn't be screwed over by unfair market practices that diminish their livelihoods.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, let's talk about the consumers. A trip down to the shop shouldn't be a stressful experience worrying about how much things are going to cost. We are taking action to help consumers get lower prices on their groceries. It's about fairness and transparency and about ensuring that every Australian has access to affordable supermarket goods so they can provide for themselves and for their family without being ripped off at the check-out. Our approach to taking on the supermarkets is based on issues that the ACCC has identified—take land banking, where Coles and Woolies hold on to land to stop smaller supermarkets from getting a foothold. They lock out smaller retailers, which strangles competition. It's a bad deal for consumers and a bad deal for suppliers. It needs to stop.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's also shrinkflation—which is something I don't usually see too much of in myself! It's where a product gets smaller but the price remains the same or even increases. This juices up profits of big companies at the expense of consumers. There are few things worse than going to the shops, buying a product that you love and finding out that it's not only more expensive but, on top of that, smaller than it was before. It's a bloody rip-off. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, there's a squeeze on suppliers. The Food and Grocery Code of Conduct is an important weapon in our fight against the squeeze. This code was once voluntary, but this government has made it mandatory. What we need now is better enforcement. This code is a game changer for suppliers who have been bullied by supermarkets for far too long. By forcing this code, we can ensure that suppliers are treated fairly and that they can negotiate with the big supermarkets for a more equal position. But the big supermarkets have such a stranglehold on the industry that, for many consumers, there isn't any local alternative to Coles or Woolworths. As a supplier, if you ditch the big supermarkets, there might be no-one else to sell your product to. We're revitalising the National Competition Policy to address this. A competitive market is the backbone of a healthy economy. By encouraging competition, we stimulate innovation, improve efficiency and ultimately provide consumers with more choices at a lower price and provide suppliers with more retailers to work with.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are sick and tired of the misconduct of the big supermarkets. They're sick of getting ripped off. Supermarket misconduct is destroying small-business suppliers and adding to the cost of living. To combat this, we are providing $30 million of additional funding to the ACCC to crack down on this rort. We're backing the ACCC to more effectively monitor, investigate and penalise, ensuring the big supermarkets are held accountable for their actions. In addition, we are funding the consumer organisation CHOICE, over three years, to report on supermarket prices across Australia. Access to reliable information about pricing empowers Aussies to make an informed decision, creating a market where fair pricing is rewarded and unethical practices are exposed. The government's No. 1 priority is tackling the cost-of-living pressures facing hardworking Aussies all around Australia. Part of this is ensuring that people are paying a fair price at the check-out and that Australian producers are getting a fair price for their work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion embodies our commitment to fairness, transparency and wellbeing for all Australians. We are addressing this immediate need to lower supermarket prices while laying the groundwork for a more equitable and competitive economy for the long term. We are standing up to the big supermarkets. Enough is enough. We will stop this supermarket squeeze. To Coles and Woolies, I plead: look after your customers, stop screwing over your suppliers and do the right thing, as good Aussies want you to do. Please look after us.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:29</span>):  Woolworths and Coles had 51 per cent of the market in 1991. By the year 2000, 10 years later, they had 70 per cent of the market. It was 68 per cent if you listen to the government and 72 per cent if you listen to ANOP's world grocery figures. So it was definitely 70 per cent. It went from 51 per cent to 70 per cent. No-one would deny that their market share has gone up from that 70 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When they did the report on Woolworths and Coles—it was the 14th report on Woolworths and Coles. They do one every year, on average. There have been 15 reports on Woolworths and Coles in 15 years, but during the latest one, two blokes got dressed up in pig suits, and it terrified them! Within three or four hours, 403 items in Woolworths had been pulled down, and, that night, the CEO was sacked. Every political party in this place—all seven of them—is moving legislation because two blokes got dressed up in a pig suit. It's a pity that we didn't do it sooner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sick of bringing fruit in here all the time and giving the prices, but it just so happened that we had an avocado in our office, so I picked up the avocado. The farm gate price is $3.The supermarket price is $8.50. That's nearly 300 per cent higher. I've spoken about potatoes many times in this place. The farmer gets 99c, and they're $3.90 at Woolworths. How much longer do you accept this? No country on Earth—England is actually the worst, and the big six have only 36 per cent of the market. Here, the big two most certainly have 80 per cent—and I'd say it's closer now to 90 per cent—of the market. Remember ,the market they don't have are tiny little towns. They still make up about 10 per cent of Australia's population, but no one would put a supermarket there, so they're not interested. But how much longer can this go on for?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The week after the pig stunt, seven political parties said they were moving legislation. Here comes the legislation again. It doesn't reduce their market share. The legislation from the honourable member from Hobart and me reduces their market share by law over five years to 20 per cent of the market. At present, they have over 40 per cent each. That would be 20 per cent each. Foreign corporations have only five per cent. Aldi can return themselves to Europe, where they came from, as far as I'm concerned. But that's the legislation. There's no easy way to do this. You either do it or you just keep fooling around and make the people more and more angry with you, because they know all you're doing is politics. You're in big trouble. The pig suit's got you in big trouble. All of Australia is screaming for your throat, so what you do is run along. You've already had your 15th inquiry in 15 years. They got a bit scared, so they came out a bit brutal. The inquiry was as well, which was a bit different for an inquiry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Winston Churchill said, 'If you absolutely won't and must not do it, then, of course, you must have an inquiry.' The wider the terms of reference, of course, the less likely it is to hit any target. That's what we're watching here once again. I applaud the government for putting a bit of a scare up them, but you will not do the thing that is required to be done. I don't know about other people, but I used to take 60 bucks down to the supermarket when my wife was away and I was fending for myself. Now I take 160 bucks down. I just can't believe it. Even the statistics would indicate the horrific markup that exists in Australia. They are not showing profits, I might add. The shareholders are not getting a benefit from this, because the profits are going towards maintaining a monopoly of two in the marketplace. That is where the profits are going. Of course, the corporates are paying themselves $13 million a year. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms FERNANDO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:34</span>):  The cost of living is the No. 1 concern in my community. Many are struggling to afford everyday essentials. As their representatives, we have a duty to protect them from unfair business practices. While global events such as COVID-19 and the conflict in Ukraine have disrupted supply chains and pushed up prices, some companies have exploited these circumstances to boost their profits at the expense of Australian families. Our government is taking action to address these practices. We've launched one of the biggest crackdowns on supermarkets in history, focusing on transparency, accountability and fair pricing. Our step was to launch an inquiry into price gouging by supermarkets and to provide price comparisons across Coles, Woolworths and Aldi. These three retailers control 75 per cent of the market, yet the code regulating their conduct with suppliers has been voluntary and lacked real penalties. Under Labor, this will change. We are making the code mandatory for supermarkets with revenue exceeding $5 billion. By introducing enforceable rules and meaningful penalties, we are ensuring farmers and families get a fair go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is also tackling misleading practices head on. The government is taking Woolworths and Coles to court for fake discounts. This is where they have been accused of inflating prices, only to apply a 'discount' sticker falsely advertising deals while charging more than the original price. We are also addressing shrinkflation, where companies reduce product sizes but keep prices at the same level. If you think your packets of chips or boxes of cereal have been getting smaller, you are probably right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We don't want to see ordinary Australians, families and pensioners being taken for a ride by the supermarkets, and we're taking steps to make sure they get a fair go at the checkout.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To back this up, we've committed $30 million in additional funding to the ACCC to enforce these measures. This is what happens when a government properly equips and supports its regulator to do their job. Under the Liberals, regulators were weakened and the big businesses were left unchecked. Labor are reversing this trend by strengthening our consumer regulator to ensure fairness at the checkout.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also addressing hidden fees on digital payments. While card payments are now commonplace, many Australians have been hit with sneaky charges. The Albanese government is preparing to ban excessive debit card surcharges pending advice from the Reserve Bank of Australia. This reform will put more money back in Australians' pockets while helping small businesses compete fairly against larger retailers, who often use their size to waive these fees.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I always say that cash is king. By 2026, we will require businesses selling essential goods, such as groceries, medicines and fuel, to accept cash. Like 1.5 million Australians, I still use cash for more than 80 per cent of my transactions. We are doing this to ensure Australians have access to necessities, even in situations when digital systems fail. In a world more and more reliant on computers, we cannot afford to let bad software updates disrupt people's ability to access essential goods. Our actions our clear. We are standing up for Australians at the checkout and ensuring they are not taken advantage of by big corporations. By enforcing stronger regulations and fairer codes, we are setting a new standard—one that protects all Australians and holds businesses accountable. These reforms send a strong message: we will not stand by while families struggle and corporations profit unfairly.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VIOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:35</span>):  As someone who spent over 10 years working in the grocery industry, in fast-moving consumer goods, before coming to this place, one of many things that I'm passionate about is making sure that the supermarkets look after their suppliers and the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let us be absolutely clear. This code of conduct will not reduce prices at the supermarket at all. This code of conduct is about ensuring that Woolworths and Coles treat their suppliers and farmers with the respect they deserve given the market size that they have. That is an absolutely crucial and important endeavour. But for the government to wrap that up as a cost-of-living measure to reduce prices shows two things: they're either misleading the Australian people, or they're ignorant and they don't understand how the supermarket and grocery chains and the mandatory code actually work. That's a question that the Prime Minister should answer, because the mandatory code will not bring prices down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I look at this motion from the member for Hawke, I must say that it does bring out the best in the hypocrisy of the Albanese Labor government. I want to go to point (2). It say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… notes the Government believes that alleged misconduct in the supermarket sector is unfair, unacceptable, and it makes cost of living pressures worse for Australians …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They are prepared, as a government, to put a motion in this House about conduct that is before the courts at the moment with the ACCC. They're prepared to talk about that in a motion. But, whenever a government minister—whether it's the Prime Minister, the Treasurer or others in this government—is asked about Cbus and its disgraceful conduct in not paying out insurance payments and death payments for people who have died, to their loved ones, including members of my community, they say, 'No, we can't talk about that, because it is before ASIC.' This is the hypocrisy of the Albanese Labor government and the Treasurer. He will palm off innocent Australians who won't get the money that they are entitled to because a loved one has died. And the reason he doesn't want to talk about it is that his mentor, the former treasurer of this country and now National President of the ALP, is the Cbus chair. Shame on the ALP and the Australian government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They are not prepared to stand up for the Australian people, for the members of Cbus who have lost loved ones and can't get their money. They say they can't talk about that because it is before ASIC. Yet, at the very same time, they are prepared to bring a motion to the House to discuss the allegations against Woolworths and Coles that are currently before the ACCC. Woolworths and Coles are literally testifying to the ACCC. So we can talk about that in a motion in this House, but they won't answer questions about the misconduct of Cbus, the alleged misconduct of the National President of the ALP—talk about the hypocrisy of the Albanese Labor government.</span>

The Victorian Labor government are increasing the rents by six to 7.6 per cent per year at the fresh fruit markets in Epping in Victoria. This decision is going to drive prices up. It is going to cause farmers to suffer and have to pay more, and it's actually going to send more market share to Woolworths and Coles, because Woolworths and Coles do not need to go to the markets to buy their fruit and vegetables. Hospitality venues do. Independent supermarkets do. Independent fruit and grocery stores in my electorate and across the country rely on the Melbourne wholesale market to get their products and be competitive at a price level against Woolworths and Coles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Victorian Labor government, with not a word from the Albanese Labor government, are increasing prices by over six to seven per cent for the next decade. It is going to increase the market share of Woolworths and Coles. It is going to drive the price of fruit and vegetables up for Australian people. It is another example of Labor at a federal level and a state level moving motions and talking spin but not actually solving the challenges of the Australian people.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I move this motion supporting regional health care because there is incredible heartache—or, in departmental speak, unmet need—both within my electorate of Mallee and across rural, regional and remote Australia. A person's postcode should not determine their health status, but it does. As shadow assistant minister for regional health, I have travelled the country to consult with professional organisations, health professionals and community members at the coalface. They have stressed the dire nature of workforce shortages in their local areas. There are currently six general practitioner positions advertised in Mildura, my home city, alone, with several other towns across Mallee also looking for a local doctor. In fact, I am very proud of the fact that my husband has retired after 47 years in general practice just this week, and I will shout out to him what an extraordinary man he is and how proud I am of him. We know that small rural towns—like Dimboola, in my electorate, for example—have on average almost 60 per cent fewer health professionals than major cities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When one of my constituents needs care for a chronic condition or an ongoing illness, they face waiting lists, travelling considerable distances and additional out-of-pocket costs. Inaccessible health care results in delays to primary care. People present into hospital acutely unwell when it could have been prevented. Ultimately, regional Australians are living with worse health and dying younger than their city counterparts. We can't continue to expect people in rural, regional and remote Australia to put up with second-rate access to health care. It affects their quality of life, their livelihood and their longevity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During my travels, I have also seen examples of rural communities who are making things work. I visited a single-employer model pilot site at the Riverland regional hospital in Berri last year. They told me they have no doctor shortage in their region thanks to this model. The single-employer model's success in rural and regional Australia builds upon the Nationals' efforts for many years to develop the National Rural Generalist Pathway through the National Rural Health Commissioner. In fact, the first commissioner, Professor Paul Worley, was in that meeting in Berri last year about the single-employer model initiative because he has been working there, ensuring its success, since his term as commissioner ended.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In October, I was delighted to speak at the conference of Services for Australian Rural and Remote Allied Health, SARRAH, in Mildura. The Allied Health Rural Generalist Pathway, developing the skills required to increase rural and remote allied health workforce, has existed in several states and territories since 2014 and in the non-government and private sector since 2019. Disappointingly, it does not exist as yet in the Victorian public sector. Rural generalist pathways warrant further development across the professions.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The current Albanese Labor government has not had the needs of rural, regional and remote Australians front of mind when it comes to health. Implementing policies such as changes to the distribution priority areas, which have resulted in a net flow of international medical graduate doctors away from the regions to periurban settings, has exacerbated workforce shortages. Their signature policy of tripling the bulk-billing incentive payment might have looked good on the surface, but it has not brought more doctors to the regions, nor does it adequately cover the burgeoning costs of running a general practice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nationals are working on significant regional health policies to improve the supply of doctors and other health professionals in rural, remote and regional Australia. As shadow assistant minister, I have been developing bold policies to immediately address our dire health workforce shortages and facilitate structural reform to grow our own supply of doctors and other health professionals in the regions into the future. I must name the member for Parkes, Mark Coulton, who gave his valedictory speech today, for the work that he did previously to ensure better health care into the future for regional Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300126" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr REID</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:50</span>):  The federal Labor government is committed to strengthening healthcare services and our regional healthcare workforces right across this great country that is Australia. As a practising emergency department doctor at Wyong Hospital, I understand firsthand the importance of a robust regional health workforce, particularly in primary care. Our primary care clinicians—some of whom are present here in this chamber—know that, if you can treat an illness at the primary care level in those clinics, then you stop those diseases from exacerbating and don't end up seeing me in the middle of the night. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the election in 2022, one of the first actions made by the federal Labor government was to bolster doctors on the Central Coast by changing the region to a distribution priority area. The distribution priority area classification identifies locations in Australia with a shortage of general practitioner services. Changing the region to a DPA has meant that general practices across the region of the Central Coast—that's Robertson, Dobell and a little bit of Shortland, as I like to remind the minister—have access to a greater pool of available doctors. I note that recent data from department of health highlights that, since we came into government, last year Australia added one new doctor every hour on average, with more doctors joining in the last two years than at any time in the past decade. According to the department, an additional 17,846 new medical practitioners registered to practise in the last two financial years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2022-23 cohort of 8,356 new doctors was the largest influx of new doctors in more than a decade, and that record was beaten in 2023-24, when 9,490 doctors registered to practise. This means that more doctors are registering to practise in Australia, more junior doctors are training to become GPs and more medical graduates are aspiring to become GPs since the federal Labor government's record investments in strengthening Medicare. In 2024, close to one in five medical graduates aspired to have a career in general practice or rural general practice, with 17.5 per cent of graduates nominating general practice or rural generalist as their preferred speciality in the annual Medical Deans' survey. In addition, the number of junior doctors choosing to go into general practice grows each year. In 2024, more than 1,600 doctors accepted a place on a government funded training program to become a GP or a rural GP—a 13 per cent increase from the year before. In 2025, more than 1,750 offers are expected to be made to junior doctors to begin government funded GP training, leading to an intake that could be up to 10 per cent larger than 2024.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal Labor government's work to improve healthcare services and regional healthcare workforces does not stop here however. On the Central Coast, in the electorate of Robertson, 38 general practices received grant funding between $25,000 and $35,000, through the General Practice Grants Program as part of strengthening Medicare. The federal Labor government has provided funding to general practices across Australia to make improvements to their practices, to expand patient access and to support safe, accessible and quality primary care. For example, in my electorate, the Terrigal and Avoca medical centres combined received $60,000. The funding has enabled both practices to become reaccredited as well as a new consulting room to be built in the Terrigal practice. Additionally, the funding has enhanced practices for infection control and enabled the upgrade of essential equipment. The federal Labor government is working hard every day to strengthen health care on the Central Coast, especially in primary care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another one to mention is the Saratoga medical centre. They received a grant of $25,000 from the Strengthening Medicare General Practice Grants Program to update their IT systems. This funding helped to improve patient access and has insured upgrades to critical IT systems that are essential for general practices to function successfully. Whether it's training more GPs, a tripling of the bulk-billing incentive or investing in our general practices, only a federal Labor government be trusted to protect and strengthen healthcare services and our regional healthcare workforces across Australia.</span>

My many years of experience in the medical profession—in fact, 33 of them—were preceded by me working in the hospital system as a hospital cleaner, a central sterilising agent, a wardsman and a med student. I saw all sorts of hospitals in my training. I have seen multiple people, 18 beds in a row, down one side and 18 down the other side, with just curtains between and none of this private room rubbish—that was the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital that was built in the 1870s or 1880s and named after Prince Alfred who got shot by somebody when he came out here on a visit the 1860s—through to the Chris O'Brien centre, at the other end of the extreme, or St Vincents in Melbourne or Sydney.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing that makes the quality good is like with the F1. It's not the car; it's the driver. The health workforce is what makes Australia's health system great. Many places have Nobel prize winners, and Australia has plenty of them in our health workforce, but there's a uniform, high standard across Australia. Whereas with some countries it's all over the shop because they don't have a good health training system. A lot of them just get book knowledge. Anyone can be a doctor. You just go to uni and buy the books, and you get a medical degree. Germans and Italians used to come out here to get training as med students because they heard that we actually got to see patients.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, Houston, we have a problem! Australia doesn't have enough of a health workforce in rural Australia—from pharmacists, physios and OTs through to doctors, nurses and whatever. Because of its roots, the National Party feels this acutely. It's more than what would be felt in Sydney. There's an overall shortage of GPs, as the member mentioned. In the Deans survey, only about 15 to 17 per cent of medical students now want to do general practice. When I graduated—about the same time as your husband, Member for Mallee, or a bit after—the figure was over 50 per cent. We've got specialists for the left toe, the right ankle and everything. There are square inches of the human anatomy that are looked after by only one specialist.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a big city, you need about 10 doctors to look after a general medical patient; whereas, in the country, a generalist does it all. That's the beauty, because everything is connected—everything in the human body. We have been at the forefront of developing the rural health workforce. Unfortunately, due to the snakes and ladders of political life in this building, I wasn't there to announce the Stronger Rural Health Strategy. That fell to my successor, and I got put into children and families. But I do remember negotiating with University of Sydney, University of Melbourne, La Trobe uni, Monash University and getting medical schools created on the Sunshine Coast, because a wicked sandstone university was convinced to give up a lot of its extra places. So the people in the seats of Fairfax and Fisher have the Sunshine Coast medical school. The Queensland university at the tip of the point up there in Cairns and James Cook uni were beneficiary of the extra spots. We had Charles Sturt uni created. The National Party created that med school, because we got them a bunch of Commonwealth supported medical places, and we partnered them at the start with Western Sydney uni. Then I came back again with a second life in the health portfolio and got them a rural medical school, even though their school was rurally based.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the member that was the beneficiary of that chose to sit on another part of the building, but there we go. We were just so pleased that we got it for people in country Australia, because they have been short-changed. Convincing Melbourne uni to give La Trobe students a pathway into a Melbourne uni degree was another stroke of genius, and I worked on that. I've been at the forefront of getting all these expansions. With the HECS debt relief for nurse practitioners who go remote, they get two years off for one—the same with doctors. The Stronger Rural Health Strategy is a really good example of that, but we need more pharmacists. We need more physios. We need everything, because it's the professionals that are important, not necessarily the buildings.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PHILLIPS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:00</span>):  While living in a regional area of New South Wales, I'm all too aware of how difficult it can be to see a doctor. This government knows that too many Australians are struggling to get in to see a GP. That's why we're strengthening Medicare, and it's why we're doing everything we can to attract, train and retain more doctors, especially in regional areas like Gilmore. We made an election commitment to make it easier for Australians to see a doctor, and that's exactly what we're doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The University of Wollongong's Shoalhaven Graduate School of Medicine, located in my electorate of Gilmore, has produced many doctors that continue to live and work in our region. Doctors that study at UOW's Shoalhaven campus are staying on and working as general practitioners in our community and medical specialists at Shoalhaven and Milton Ulladulla hospitals. Former Milton pharmacist Amanda Venables was one of the first graduates from the Shoalhaven school of medicine, and she now works both in a private family medical practice and as an anaesthetist at Shoalhaven and Milton hospitals. As a small-business owner and mum, Dr Venables had long thought about studying medicine, but it wasn't until the training opportunity became available closer to home that her dream career became a reality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Providing local students with a chance to study and then go on to practice in regional areas benefits the whole community. It provides a much-needed injection of new GPs and also provides patients with a continuity of care that is so important, especially for families and our older residents. This government funds more than $1.9 billion a year for programs that develop the workforce and support more equitable distribution of health professionals to areas of need, especially regional and rural locations. The Gilmore electorate is seeing the benefits of this initiative. In 2024, more than 1,600 doctors accepted a place on a government funded training program to become a GP or rural GP, a 13 per cent increase on the year before. The 2022-23 cohort of 8,356 new doctors was the largest influx of new doctors in more than a decade. Incredibly, that record was broken in 2023-24, when 9,490 new doctors registered to practice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're investing in doctors and we're growing other areas of our health system by offering Commonwealth supported university places, which subsidise up to 75 per cent of tuition fees for eligible students studying in a range of courses, including public health, exercise physiology and medical biotechnology. Labor is also offering fee-free TAFE courses providing more training in the areas of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander primary health care, allied health, disability support, mental health, aged care and nursing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only are we training more doctors, nurses and health workers; we're providing better access to their services, particularly in regional areas like Gilmore. In my electorate, we've opened the doors to a new Medicare urgent care clinic in Batemans Bay, Kiama headspace, the South-Eastern Endometriosis and Pelvic Pain Clinic and the Shoalhaven walk-in adult mental health hub. These services are free, which is taking some financial pressure off families who we know are doing it tough. Since opening, more than 7,000 patients sought care at the Batemans Bay urgent care clinic, including Louise, who said she had a great first experience at the urgent care clinic with her toddler. She said the clinic was a great service to have in Batemans Bay. Jane turned up to have her eye checked on a Sunday, and, after thinking she would have to wait for hours in emergency, she was seen immediately by a nurse and then a doctor and sent on her way with the appropriate scripts. Best of all, her visit was all bulk-billed, and on a weekend—how good is that?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of Batemans Bay are loving their clinic, and the 2024 Albanese budget is investing a further $227 million so thousands more Australians can get the free urgent care they need, with another 29 Medicare urgent care clinics offering walk-in care seven days a week over extended hours, completely bulk-billed. There have been almost 400,000 visits to Medicare UCCs across Australia, and almost one in three visits have been for children under the age of 15. As a mum of four, I know all too well what weekends with kids can be like, with little ones falling off bikes, footy bumps and twisted ankles on the soccer field. These clinics are proving just fabulous for families, in terms of time, convenience and affordability. This government is delivering on its promise to provide more doctors, more health workers, and more accessible, affordable health care for all Australians.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="219646" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:05</span>):  Firstly, I want to commend the member for Mallee, the shadow assistant minister for regional health, on bringing to the parliament this vital motion. It is important, and if there's anybody in this place who would know just how integral it is to the success, prosperity and productivity of rural, regional and remote Australia it is the member for Mallee, whose husband of 47 years, Philip—my favourite Webster—is a long-serving GP at Mildura. He understands fully the pressures that the rural areas of Victoria face. Rural Victoria is just like the rural areas of any other state, and I found it very interesting—intriguing, in fact—to hear the east coast Labor members talking about distribution priority areas, as if they would really know!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you really go out to regional Australia and to remote Australia, where you can kick the red dust around, there's such a shortage of doctors, and but for the Nationals that shortage would continue. We have, along with our regional Liberal cousins, put forward policies that have helped ease the situation, through the National Rural Generalist Pathway. I commend the member for Parkes, who gave a wonderful valedictory speech, for the work that he did, and I commend the member for Lyne, who spoke earlier in this debate, and the shadow minister now at the bench for the work that they have done, the work that they are doing and the work that we will do in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I look at the Murray-Darling Medical Schools Network situation, particularly in Wagga Wagga. We have a young student there by the name of Madeline Ingram. She was educated at Mater Dei Catholic College. She's just 23 and in her first year at that wonderful facility. It is a bright and shiny new facility. It's yet to be opened—three storeys with a car park underneath. It's replacing Harvey House, which is an old nurses quarters, which has been in use since 1936. But, as the member for Lyne said, the important thing is that it's not about buildings; it's about the people. There's so much work that Dr Gerard Carroll, Dr Nick Stephenson and others have done to make this a reality, to get the professionals in. They've given of their own time, just as Dr Philip Webster has done for many years, to make sure that we get the best outcomes in rural and regional health, and that's what it's all about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Madeline Ingram spoke to me at the topping-out ceremony on 15 April. That's when the 18-metre height was reached for this building, which will overlook Edward Street in the medical precinct right next to Wagga Wagga Base Hospital. She talked about the 90 students who will learn there, and she talked about the importance of doing the course, which ends up getting you your doctor's degree, from start to finish in a rural setting. All too often in the past we've seen the brightest and best of the students start their course. They go off to Sydney to do a couple of years and never come back. They fall in love with somebody, just like the member for Mallee did all those years ago—not too many, Member for Mallee, but you get my drift. Indeed, we want our student doctors to learn from the best, like Dr Carroll, Dr Stephenson and others. We want our doctors to be able to have beautiful new infrastructure, where they can feel the ambience and they can feel that there is a future in a rural setting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also want them to be let loose, so to speak, on our rural patients, because it shouldn't be that when you are in pain you have to catch a plane. It should be that in our regional hubs, such as Wagga Wagga, Orange, Mildura, Shepparton and Dubbo, we have those rural medical schools through that Murray-Darling network. We have the buildings. We have the people. We have the political will, thanks to the National Party. It has been the National Party that's pushed that. It's been the National Party that's delivered that. I am so very proud that it is making a difference along with all the other options and policies that we will bring forward to the next election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Mallee is right when she says that the burden of disease experienced in the population increases with geographic remoteness. It's not right and it's not fair. Let's not forget that it was these regional and remote Australians who carried this country during the COVID pandemic. They were the ones who still mined. They were the ones who still farmed. They were the ones who helped our balance of payments. They're the ones we should never ever neglect and make sure they've got the best health outcomes in the future. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:11</span>):  The regions bear a heavier burden of disease than any other part of Australia. Within my electorate, I have regional areas, rural areas and remote areas. Kangaroo Island is classified as a remote area. I am very conscious of the regional health inequity that exists in my community. So I am delighted to lend my support to the member for Mallee's motion and join her call asking for government and the minister to advance rural general pathways in medicine, nursing and allied health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as significant staffing shortages in the regions and the tyranny of distance to access metropolitan services, those of us living in the regions receive less health spending per person. If you live in the regions, you are less likely to have affordable and timely access to a GP. You are less likely to have access to diagnostic services, such as regional breast care screening. If you need to see a cardiologist, you'll want to hope you live within 50 kilometres of the CBD.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Rural Australia produces at least 80 per cent of Australia's exports, 90 per cent of Australia's food—we feed the nation—and 50 per cent of our tourism revenue despite housing only a third of our population. Rural health care remains critically underfunded, and rural outcomes in our communities from a health perspective are vastly inferior. Rural areas have up to 50 per cent fewer health providers such as general practitioners, physiotherapists, psychologists, dentists—my goodness, how much do we love a dentist in the regions?—pharmacists, optometrists, and podiatrists than the major cities. In fact, remote communities bear 1.4 times the total disease burden compared to those in major cities and we receive less funding on a per capita basis despite that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Analysis commissioned by the Rural Health Alliance shows that in 2020-21 there was a $6.5 billion gap in expenditure on health care in rural Australia compared to the cities. Expenditure and health services for a person living in rural Australia sits at $848 less per person per year than for their metropolitan counterpart. That's the difference between them, largely due to a lack of affordable health care in regional, rural and remote Australia. This equates to a gap of $6.55 billion between metro and rural areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have previously raised some of these issues, including the closure of many rural general practices in my electorate. We are not the most remote. Kangaroo Island is remote, but many parts of Mayo are accessible within an hour and a half—of course, that's if you've got a car—from the metropolitan areas. But we are feeling it with the closure of GPs. Often it's because the GPs, with the changes the government's made, are able to now be reclassified, particularly if they're from overseas. They can work in places like Morphett Vale and live in Malvern. They can live in North Adelaide and go out to Elizabeth. That's how people from overseas can get around the system now, because they changed it from being MM 5 down to MM 2. What that means is that we've had a shrinkage of the workforce, particularly with our GPs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As an aside, I'd also like to speak in support of the call by General Practice Registrars Australia for the GP workforce shortage to be addressed more generally. GPRA has asked government to fund an independent GP registrars employment fund, comprising a base rate wage, a supplement for first-year GP registrars, and independent GP training support. These are the kinds of initiatives we need. We need every avenue possible to get the smart country kids who go off and do their medical degrees back into the regions so they can work in the place they know. We desperately need them. If we don't have health services across our regions, people just can't live in the regions. And we need people in the regions, because otherwise the rest of us are going to starve. We in the regions grow the food, we grow the fibre—we support the nation—yet we are the country cousins. We are second-class citizens when it comes to health in this nation, and the government need to address this.</span>
