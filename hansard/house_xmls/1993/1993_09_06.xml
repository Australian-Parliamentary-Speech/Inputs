In every year of the next four years, the opposition would increase the deficit, therefore harming Australia's reputation internationally.

         What the Prime Minister was saying yesterday, which should have been clear even to the honourable member for Mayo, was that the central objective of the government's budget strategy is the reduction over four years in the Commonwealth budget deficit. That strategy is the integral part of the budget, and it remains the integral part of the budget. In the end that is the issue which the opposition has to confront.

         If honourable members opposite look at what commentators, who have no political axe to grind in this matter, have been saying about the government's budget strategy—almost to a man and a woman—they will see that they are saying our strategy is correct; it is supported by those who make judgments about Australia here and overseas. They need look no further than the observations of Mr Beers from Standard and Poor's about what the government is attempting to do and what the government proposes to do in the context of the reduction in the deficit. He believes that is the appropriate way for us to handle the fiscal position in Australia, and he says that that approach is supported by financial markets here and overseas.

         —I believe there are increasing signs in economic terms that better times are ahead and we have good reasons to be cautiously optimistic. There are important factors which put a brake on that confidence, and one is the world economy, which is still weak, with growth this year forecast to be only just over one per cent. We have seen the result of this in our commodity prices, which have fallen again over the past 12 months and which are now almost 30 per cent below their peak of June 1989. A 30 per cent shift in commodity prices from June 1989 is a very large drop. In fact, commodity prices are lower than they were on average when they collapsed in 1986-87. From memory, they were last that low in the Depression. So commodity prices are at very low levels, coming off low levels of world international activity.

         But balanced against that are positive forces which are also dominating or starting to reap their reward in terms of confidence in the business climate of Australia. These are, amongst others, inflation last year at one per cent, with core inflation likely to remain low at between two and three per cent this year, notwithstanding the direct effects of our lower dollar; that it is 20 years since interest rates were last this low; our international competitiveness has improved by 20 per cent over the past three years, which is continuing to help our exporters expand; and profits have risen by 12 per cent over the last year.

         So profits are up 12 per cent, international competitiveness has improved by 20 per cent, interest rates are at 20 year lows and inflation is at the lowest any of us in this parliament have ever lived with, that is, around two to three per cent. These are all reasons for some confidence and they are certainly having confidence effects in the business community.

         Today, the ANZ Bank released its job vacancy series, which shows that job ads are providing further encouragement, with job ads up 1.2 per cent for August following rises of 3.9 per cent for July and 4.9 per cent to June. The ANZ job vacancy series is now 19.1 per cent above its level of a year ago. The series is up nearly 20 per cent, which I think means there is some prospect for acceleration in job growth for the rest of the year. What we need most is improvement in employment and lower levels of unemployment.

         We should not put all this at risk—and that is what the opposition has been trying to do in the last few weeks. We have a budget strategy which is right for the economy—all the conditions are coming together; that is, low inflation, low interest rates, a 20 per cent lift in competitiveness, profits up 12 per cent over the last year and the job index series up nearly 20 per cent—to kick the economy along. It was observed on the

        Following the budget the stock market has risen by four per cent and 10-year bonds have continued to rally and are now at 6.6 per cent—down from 6.8 per cent at budget time and from nine per cent at the start of the year. So, if we want any guide to confidence—where the Reserve Bank's daily market arrangements are not having any influence on the rates—long term bond rates are down from nine per cent yield at the start of the year; at the beginning of the budget they were 6.8 per cent and are now at 6.6 per cent.

         The strategy is right and the markets have been saying it is right. In recent days we have seen the impact on the currency of the Leader of the Opposition's high jinks. As the Governor of the Reserve Bank said today:

       <para>
        The market agrees and a representative of Standard and Poor's on the radio this morning said exactly the same thing. Yet the Leader of the Opposition persists with this strategy. He talked about what he called the amazing growth forecast in the budget. Is 2.7 per cent amazing, when we have had 3.1 per cent already for the past year? He thinks that 2.7 per cent for the coming year is amazing, or 3 3/4 per cent for next year or four per cent for the year thereafter. Supposedly that is amazing. This comes from the Leader of the Opposition, who is doing his best to upset the confidence levels which are growing in the economy. He says that he will not agree to the passage of budget legislation, which the markets, the central bank, the Democrats and most commentators say in economic terms is right for the economy. I will quote from the Leader of the Opposition's remarks about what he thought would be his own legislation. Last year he said:

        My own view is that we will put all our policies into parliament as a package—industrial relations legislation, the tax bills, the new Reserve Bank Act and other changes to other pieces of legislation. They will have to knock out the benefits to get at what they see as the advantages.

In the One Nation statement he pledged that the budget would be in surplus by 1995-96. Prior to the election campaign he revised that; he pledged that there would be a budget deficit of between one half and one per cent of GDP by 1995-96. Then, during the election campaign, he again extended the deficit reduction target to one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. Three weeks ago in the budget he extended it again to 1.1 per cent of GDP by 1996-97. Then, last Monday night, when he was comprehensively rolled by the caucus, he extended it again to 1.2 per cent of GDP by 1996-97. Given that these deficit targets have now blown out four times in the last 18 months, what evidence is there that he can meet any of these targets in the next four years?

         —That could have been my answer. I have been making precisely those points, but I have been making an additional one as well. This economic iconoclast and his shadow Treasurer now say that it does not matter if we add another $3 billion to the deficit in 1996-97, and it does not matter if we add another $1 1/2 billion to the deficit this year. These are the people who are the authors of a proposal which would expand the deficit this year by $1 1/2 billion and expand the deficit four years from now by over $3 billion. What a cheek they have to come in here and question a strategy which has more integrity than any proposal by any Western government in terms of a deficit reduction strategy—

It now falls to the working party to develop the ACTU alternative to ensure that it meets the government's policy objective—a policy objective spelt out by the Prime Minister on 21 April this year. It is worth reminding the House that we are not the only ones talking about enterprise unions; some of Australia's largest employers groups have been talking about them as well. In their August 1993 submission to the government the Business Council of Australia said that `the registration of new enterprise unions should be permitted under the act, regardless of size'. In its submission of May this year the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said that the act should recognise enterprise branches of unions.

The point has been made, and made properly, that in the absence of an entity to represent workers there is a bit of a problem in getting a collective bargain. It is one of the big weaknesses. Quite frankly, it is one of the weaknesses that the establishment of an enterprise union will actually allow us to overcome because, in simple essence, it means there will be someone to agree with, rather than individual contracts.

The way we will do this is to seek to encourage more competition and institutional reform in this industry. The reform of this industry has been estimated to expand national output by more than $2 billion annually, so it has great prospects for generating more investment and more jobs and for lifting Australia's export performance by reducing costs.

         But, just as in aviation and in telecommunications, the existing monopolies will do all they can to protect their vested interests by arguing that the introduction of competition will in some way reduce R&amp;D or restrict the ability of the utilities to market themselves overseas. These are the very same arguments that we got when we sought to introduce competition in telecommunications. It is the federal government's view that, by introducing competition in electricity supply, we can ensure that the advantages which telephone customers and aviation users are receiving today will also flow to electricity consumers through cheaper electricity.

         —We will be looking at the Snowy. I can tell the honourable member that we could do with a bit of help from the New South Wales and Victorian Liberal ministers on reforming the Snowy. While improvements in efficiency have already led to some reduction in electricity prices, my view is that it is state treasuries which have captured a significant proportion of the past savings in reform of this industry. But it is important we acknowledge that at the June heads of government meeting in Melbourne there was increased pressure on the states to ensure that these benefits begin to flow to the industrial and domestic consumers.

         The effect of the reforms agreed to at COAG is to give consumers greater choice. For the first time, customers and distributors will be able to deal directly with generators, which is an important part of introducing competition in this industry. Heads of government agreed to the introduction of a fully competitive market by 1 July 1995. A major test of the states' commitment to reform will be the way they conduct paper trials which are due to commence on 1 November this year.

         But of immediate concern to me are three issues which have the potential to delay the COAG reform program. First, while Victoria has recently announced that it intends to restructure the SECV into three separate business units, I understand that, currently, Victoria is planning to prevent Victorian customers from dealing directly with generators in other states. Second, I have argued very strongly to the New South Wales Minister for Minerals and Energy that Pacific Power's plans to have a single portfolio manager for all New South Wales electricity will eliminate intrastate competition. Third, for the benefit of my friend from Victoria, there is a need to obtain the agreement of New South Wales and Victoria in progressing the reform of the Snowy scheme so that it can be an independent, competitive generator in the new markets.

I have written to my state colleagues to try to ensure that we can meet at an early opportunity to try to progress these reforms.

         Those unions who have embraced the role of leadership in enterprise bargaining have done a marvellous job.

         I want the rest of the trade union movement—those who are not embracing it at the moment—to develop a similar enthusiasm for enterprise bargaining. Very importantly, I want enterprise bargaining to be spread throughout the present non-unionised sector so that everyone in Australia will get out of bed in the morning and say, `How can I make my workplace more productive? How can I make my business that much better? How can I share in that productivity?'. Quite frankly, where enterprise bargains are appropriate and where a majority of the workers are in favour of them, they are a very clever way of developing the opportunity for the movement to reinvent itself.

         The government recognised this when it embraced a strategy for growth in One Nation and Investing in the Nation, and dramatically expanded our labour market programs so that since the beginning of last year funding for labour market programs has more than doubled. With this year's budget it has increased by a further $1.3 billion. A total of 644,000 people will benefit from a labour market program in 1993-94; 154,000 of these places are in the jobstart program which gives wage subsidies of up to $230 per week for private sector employers. The effectiveness of these programs has increased. Eighty per cent of the long-term unemployed who get a full-time job have participated in a labour market program. So there is no doubt that the labour market programs are having their impact on the capacity of the long-term unemployed to find themselves employment in the labour market and to keep it.

If we are committed, we shall not shy away from measures to achieve it.

         That we are obliged to do this at all is directly as a result of the unprecedented—it is unprecedented since 1975—threat by the opposition to oppose a major proportion of the budget. By doing so, it creates in our constitution and constitutional arrangements a whole new world of difficulty for any government of the day, from whatever side the government is drawn.

         —I intend to deal with that point very quickly. The honourable member needs an answer on that so that he understands the full extent of his vandalism. I do not expect the realisation of that to come naturally to him. For the 10 years we have been in office we have not had a Senate majority. That has meant that from time to time bits and pieces of the budget have been picked over. There is no question about that. We have complained about that when it has occurred. We complained when we were attempting to sell the Pipeline Authority, which was a major component of savings measures in the budget, that we were being prevented from doing so by the opposition at the time. The impact of that did not go to the heart of the budget; it went to the issues to one side.

         The changes to the budget were made or announced the other day by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). The intentions of this government can be regarded as being part of that same process. At the end of the day we are frequently obliged to make some small adjustments around the edges of a budget. Those adjustments were made having taking account of the views put forward in consultation with colleagues. Again, those adjustments, on the initiative sometimes of the Senate and from sections of the party room, have been made over the past 10 years. Any government which does not enjoy a majority in the Senate will not find itself in any different position. What is different here is that a very central proportion of the revenue raising of the budget is under attack. That is a difference.

It is a substantial proportion which materially affects the flexibility of the government and the public regard of the budget to the point where it creates difficulties such as we are now experiencing on the money markets. There is a clear-cut difference between the situation this government confronts in 1993 and that which the government confronted in 1975, the last occasion on which such a large-scale measure was undertaken.

         In that instance it was different in that it was a rejection of supply which, to this point, we understand is not among the propositions being put forward by the opposition. Whilst it is not of that magnitude, it is nevertheless greater than that which has been experienced before. We have already seen a very substantial impact through the responses of the money markets and elsewhere to the notion that the budget, favourably received by them, is perhaps being interfered with in an unacceptable way. The difference between now and that which existed in 1975, or for that matter in 1981-82, is that we now have a floating dollar and a substantially deregulated financial sector. If that is placed under threat, that is a very substantial problem for the conduct of decent government in this country.

         The argument is made that the government, when it was in opposition, did the same sort of thing in the previous era. In the 1981 budget put forward by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) it was suggested that we would make what he saw as unacceptable changes to the wholesale sales tax. What was proposed then was an increase in all rates of 2 1/2 per cent, the correction of some anomalies and inconsistencies—they were the euphemisms—and a broadening of the wholesale sales tax base to impose tax on certain goods previously exempt. All three measures added up to 1.4 per cent of the total 1981-82 revenue, 0.3 per cent of the total revenue in the particular measure that was considered.

         The first and second of those measures passed the Senate. The third did not. The third was budgeted to raise $132 million or 0.3 per cent of total revenue in 1981-82. That is what the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), among others, describes as exactly the same as effectively ripping three per cent—10 times as much—out of this budget. That removal of $132 million is basically the equivalent of the sorts of minor adjustments from time to time that we have been making over the years under pressure from the Senate—sometimes from the opposition and sometimes from minor parties—since we have been in office.

         What we have never imposed when we were in the position to do so, and what we specifically eschewed during the last election campaign, was the notion that we would rip the heart out of a budget—even in handling legislation that we did not like and that we fundamentally opposed during the election campaign with regard to some $3 1/2 million. It is an act of absolute irresponsibility by the opposition that it has put the budget under this level of threat. It is an act of extraordinary stupidity by a party that considers itself potentially a governing party of this nation.

         This ploy by the opposition will never be forgotten by us, in the same way as we did not forget the 1975 episode. One of the reasons why we never attempted to use a position in the Senate to refuse supply or to make major shifts in the budget and one of the reasons why the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made the statements that he did during the last election—not all the reasons why, but one of them—was that we have said since 1975 that we would not use the hurt and pain of those circumstances to make government in this country impossible.

         But this party on the other side, which has absolutely no reason to complain in any way about how it has been treated historically by our recognition of the conventions of this country, has decided to take temporary advantage to attempt to wreck a budget. This party has so little regard for what it has done that today the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), having boasted during his reply to the budget speech that he would rip the heart out of the budget—that was the only original part of the speech—had the hide to ask the Treasurer what he intended to do about the deficit, saying how terrible it was.

         What that reflects is the Leader of the Opposition's comprehension that somewhere down the line he has been doing something severely wrong that has been having an impact on the money markets and the business community—somehow he had to shift the argument to some notion that the government, which does not have a majority in the Senate, has put up a proposition to deal with precisely the problems he was talking about and is having that proposition rejected by the Leader of the Opposition's party. The fact that he was prepared to do that shows the hide of the man and the brazenness reflected in that original decision.

         So the opposition has decided to set a precedent of the utmost seriousness—and one we will not forget. There may come a time when we on this side of the House are in opposition. In the last couple of weeks, those opposite have set the standards for the conduct of the Senate forever. They have done it without thought or consideration—maybe in the pain of having lost a fair and democratic election they have been led to these actions. But the fact is that they have set a precedent of the utmost danger to decent, stable government in this country. The one thing that we have had over the Americans in this regard is that the government of the day has been able to get its budget through without extraordinary pickings over by the legislature. This means that at least we can use budgetary measures to maintain stability in our currency and the possibility of decent growth rates in the community. It is that which those opposite wish to jettison.

Compared with the Americans, who sail through the international economy like a battleship under way, we are a cork, given our size, that pops around on whatever wave and in whatever direction the tide is going. We cannot help that. It is the position we are in, being an economy the size of about one-half of one of the major American states. So we cannot afford that. We require stability in our institutions.

It vandalised it in 1975, as from time to time the opposition spokesman who will speak after me, the honourable member for Bennelong has acknowledged. He said that one of the major problems of the Fraser government was that it had its legitimacy destroyed by the acts of 1975. It is a point he has made publicly; I am just quoting him.

Not only do I welcome the fact that I have been so comprehensively rolled on every one of the positions that I adopted'—in the case of the opposition leader that would be on the republic, on Mabo or whatever—`and have given them the flexibility they wanted; I think the party was right to do it to me.

Some idiot told him somewhere along the line that the parliament ultimately was the tool of the executive arm of government and that the executive could come in and do anything it likes. Of course it is not, and never has been. Somebody told him that this was it and so he removed from his consciousness the sensible, tactical position that any decent leader of the opposition could be expected to adopt. He elevated the capacity of the Senate to determine effectively the timetable of the House of Representatives and got that through.

         The second set of propositions that he has put forward is to elevate the right of the Senate effectively to destroy or rip the heart out of a budget. As I said, that is a right which we in opposition never took upon ourselves, despite the deep bitterness that people on this side of the House felt about the events of 1975. Opposition members have never experienced what we did in 1975; they did it. Now they are attempting to do it again. It is contemptible. Part of the consequences of that contemptible action is the fact that we have to move motions such as the motion I am moving here today.

         —The speech I have just listened to from the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) is one of the more interesting that I have heard him deliver for a long time on these sorts of motions. It was interesting in two very important respects: firstly, he laid out very clearly what the government's sermon of the week is, `You over there in the opposition ranks are constitutional vandals and constitutional wreckers'. In the course of my remarks I am going to deal with the validity of that proposition. Secondly, he sought to establish in the course of his speech what the opposition had done in response to the second Dawkins budget, which undoubtedly is the most derided and unpopular budget that this country has seen since the end of World War II. I say to the Leader of the House, `Do not try to draw any comfort in comparisons between the mood of the community in relation to the Senate's actions in 1975 and the mood of the community now'.

         The Leader of the House says that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) does not have any idea of how parliament operates. That is completely untrue. I say to him, `You do not have any idea of the mood of the Australian people if you believe that in some way the Australian people object to the attitude taken by the opposition in relation to these budget measures'. In announcing ahead of the Australian Democrats, ahead of anybody else, that we were going to oppose certain measures in the budget, the opposition has articulated the simple anger of Australians who know that they have been misled. That is why we have done it. If the Leader of the House thinks that the punters in the hotels and clubs of Australia are going around saying, `Gee, aren't the Liberals being constitutional vandals in voting against the sales tax increases', he is completely out of touch with what the Australian people are thinking at present.

         The only crisis is an internal political crisis inside the Labor Party, and from the very beginning the puny attempt of the Leader of the House to whip this up into some kind of constitutional outrage has lacked any kind of substance. It is even more insubstantial because the Leader of the House has completely overlooked two things. The first thing he has overlooked is that all the opposition is doing is following a precedent that oppositions on both sides of the parliament have followed for a very long time. We have exercised our undoubted right—that the Labor Party exercised in 1981—to vote against certain elements of a budget. Yet, in his tone of phoney indignation, his confected outrage, the Leader of the House tries to suggest that in some way we are on the brink of a constitutional crisis and the country is falling apart.

         In 1981 the Labor Party voted against the three taxation measures that the Leader of the House has just enumerated. He went on to say that only one of them was defeated by the Senate. He should have been candid enough to say that the Labor Party voted against all three of them, and the reason why only one of them was defeated was that the Labor Party did not have the numbers without the support of a couple of defectors from the government of the time to defeat the extension of the sales tax measures. But if those defectors had been available, the Labor Party would have voted out the other two measures in the budget just as easily, just as happily and just as gaily as it voted out the extension of the sales tax measure.

Perhaps the worst mistake the Leader of the House made in the speech just now was to completely overlook some remarks that were made—not by some mere underling in the Labor Party in 1982—by the present Prime Minister when he was the opposition spokesman on minerals and energy and also state president of the Labor Party in New South Wales. He was in a fairly fulsome mood because it was the day after the Lowe by-election which the Labor Party had won.

The honourable member for Blaxland made it perfectly clear that if he had his way and if he could persuade the caucus room he would in fact induce, encourage and persuade the Labor Party to vote down the government's legislation to bring on an early election.

The opposition is only doing what the present party in government did in 1981.

         So the reasoning behind this motion is revealed to be utter humbug. The Leader of the House was nowhere more unconvincing than when he said, `We will never forget what you are doing'.

I can say to the Leader of the House that I do not think anybody on this side of the House—I say it with the greatest of goodwill—was the least bit frightened when he said, `None of us are ever going to forget what you are doing today'. That was a very pathetic attempt to try to breathe some life into this idea that in some way the opposition is creating a constitutional crisis. There is no constitutional crisis in Australia. In fact, Australia has enormous constitutional tranquillity, which is a very relevant argument in another debate that I will not dwell on at the moment.

Of course, if we did that, once again, the house of the people, the House of Representatives, would see its power and authority in this country swing away. Opposition members ought to think about this, because we have two senators from Western Australia—well meaning as they are—deciding the fate of this country. And why is that?

But members of the House of Representatives are going to be denied their right to speak on some important pieces of legislation because of a time limit imposed in another place and supported by the opposition. Opposition backbenchers, as well as government backbenchers, will not get a chance to speak in the debate because of that decision.

         —The honourable member for Mayo says, `Well, don't give them up'. Of course, the honourable member for Mayo probably has not even read the papers lately. I must have just missed it; I try to keep abreast of things, but I had this funny idea that it was the opposition which joined with the Greens and the Democrats to impose this time limit. No-one from the government voted for the time limit; it was supported by Senator Hill. The honourable member for Mayo might remember that Senator Hill is a leading member of his party. The honourable member for Mayo might not like it, but he is.

         The point is that the honourable member for Mayo might go along to the opposition tactics committee meeting because it has obviously slipped his mind that it is in favour of this time limit. Maybe the honourable member for O'Connor will take him by the hand to the next one and see that the shadow Treasurer gets to have his say, because I am startled to think that maybe he is a little bit more sensible than I gave him credit for, although that would be very difficult.

         The bottom line is that this House should maintain its supremacy. This is the House that is directly elected by the people. This is the House where the government of Australia is formed. For members of the opposition—for any member of this parliament—to, in the end, go out and kill it, really does great damage to the democratic process in this country. What the opposition is seeing is the same as what it did to its leader in 1974. John Hewson and Bill Snedden have a lot in common. What they have in common is the people sitting behind them who are using the Senate to achieve the same end now that they did then. I would ask the opposition to rethink its strategy and to assert the supremacy of this House. I would ask all members to support the proposition of the Leader of the House.

         —The three bills included in the declaration of urgency today—the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993, the Customs Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993 and the Excise Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993—contain all of the measures that the coalition has indicated it will oppose. The coalition made that very clear. Of course, two days after the introduction of the budget, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), in his response, made that commitment very clear. All of a sudden we are told that these bills have to be guillotined through on 6 September. In fact, the rules applicable in the Senate as to the introduction of bills in this House do not apply until 1 October. One might ask: why the rush? It is, of course, for other reasons. When these particular bills are declared urgent, as they will be simply because of the substantial majority of the Labor Party in this place, it will bring the total number of bills declared urgent by this government in its 10-year history to 566.

         —A total of 566 bills. Between 1918 and the commencement of this government in office, the total number of bills guillotined was approximately 240. The honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) shed crocodile tears about this House being the dominant House. His words were that we were trying to frustrate the will of the people. This House has been dragged into total irrelevance by this process of the guillotine but, worse, guillotines at the end of a parliamentary session when there was no opportunity for the coalition or the Independents in the Senate to take the information, the bills and the proposals to the people to get some idea of their reaction.

         The need for this motion is considerably in doubt. Quite clearly, we have three weeks of sittings to go. If the Leader of the House, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley), wants to say, `There are hardly any sitting days', we have already made government members an offer on that arrangement. We are quite happy to accommodate them and sit every day between now and 1 October if they like. We will come here. When we see the performance of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), his Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and today his Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton), we can see why they do not want any more sitting days than necessary. They are terrified. We have asked three or four questions a day. The Prime Minister has been jumping up and down ready to grab the microphone at a quarter to three, or a quarter to four as it was today, to ask that further questions be placed on the

         It is in that regard that I thought we should look at some of the remarks made by the Leader of the House and the honourable member for Watson. The Leader of the House said that it was wrong to `elevate the Senate to that level'. As I said, the honourable member for Watson talked about frustrating the will of the people. What is the Senate doing? It is simply suggesting—because the coalition parties have taken the lead and given a lead to the Independents—that it will keep the government to its election promises. It is not an election that occurred two or three years ago; it is an election that occurred some months ago.

         I have to remind honourable members of the images of that election produced by the Labor Party's very excellent advertising company. I can still see the advertisements—they are burnt on my brain. I can see a series of election advertisements all referring to what the coalition's policies were, with the clear inference that if people voted Labor none of these dreadful things would happen. Remember the advertisement about the kid's tutu—the little ballet dress? Ding, up went the cash register. There were all the other references, and the cash register kept ringing. It is ringing now. Sales tax is being rung up at an extra one per cent. According to the road transport forum, the increase on diesel fuel excise is putting an extra $3 on a basket of groceries. Then there was that other advertisement which depicted various job opportunities in the tourist industry, with young people dressed up as chefs, being blown away.

         We go further, because the Leader of the House has been at some pains on a couple of occasions to argue how successful he was in convincing the racing industry in part of his electorate to vote for him and return him. The point is at that point in time, as I have already pointed out to a number of people, that the audience to which the minister refers was only 10 per cent of his own constituency. The others were people from other places. His view of the outcome of that meeting conflicts with mine. Let me remind the Leader of the House of what the Treasurer's uncle, Sir Ernest Lee-Steere, his mother's brother, said. I hope it was while the Leader of the House was still there, because he said that he stayed around. Sir Ernest made a very powerful case for the introduction of a GST. He said very clearly that he disagreed with the Leader of the House at that time.

I believe that the point I have been making throughout this speech is that—notwithstanding the complaints of the Leader of the House and the honourable member for Watson about the activities of the Senate and the Independents in the Senate and about the very principled position of the coalition, which they are criticising at length in their debate—we are doing no more than demanding that the government stick to its election promises and maintain faith with the Australian people. I have been giving examples of how the Australian people were led to a belief that, if they voted Labor, there would be no taxation. I was giving some examples within the racing industry. The honourable member for Canning said straight out in a letter addressed to another trainer:

        In fact, the opposite would have applied. I could add to those points the fact that I saw a letter in the office of the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Ms Gallus), when she was contesting the election, which was brought in by a very agitated, elderly Greek gentleman. Somebody, who was not directly associated with the government, had sent him a letter in Greek saying that if the Liberals got elected all persons who did not have citizenship would be returned to their home of origin. That is the most outrageous type of politicking. There were others in South Australia who, as occupants of public housing, received letters from fellow travellers indicating that people in public housing were all going to be turfed out. Many years ago we had the then Senator Murphy table something like 147 examples of evidence that the Labor Party over time had taken similar action.

I wish the government would get this straight. I would like it to be consistent. I give as an example the circumstances of the last two weeks. Last week the government started off with this cannon fodder argument, with the Prime Minister and the Treasurer telling us that the coalition parties had become irrelevant, that we did not matter, that the Australian Democrats and the Greens were setting the agenda and that we had been left behind—notwithstanding that our position was so clearly stated by the Leader of the Opposition, the most secure leader in this place today, particularly in comparison with the Prime Minister.

         —It is my pleasure to speak on the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill, the Customs Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill and the Excise Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill. Given all that we have heard from opposition members and, in particular, the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), we could be forgiven for forgetting what the last election was fought and won on. In this House we have heard all the concerns of opposition members about the impact of this budget on the poor. I seem to recall that in the last election the opposition was proposing a goods and services tax, which was going to raise some $27 billion in revenue. In addition, it was proposing some $10 billion in expenditure cuts to the budget. It defies belief that such a proposal would not impact adversely on the poor and those least able to bear it. At one stage under its proposals, the opposition was going to tax the bread and meat that people ate. All the goods and services that people currently pay no tax on were going to be subject to the imposition of a 15 per cent tax.

         I find it amazing that the opposition, having lost the election and having lectured the Australian people that it had the right policy and that they were wrong not to vote for it, comes into this place and argues about the government's budget proposals. Worse than that is the fact that the opposition is opposing the budget measures. I think it is a responsible position for major parties to avoid cheap politics and, at all times, act responsibly. I believe that any government, whether it be a coalition government or a Labor government, deserves to have its budget proposals voted on and passed by the Senate. It is a shame that the opposition has learned nothing from the traumatic events of 1975. It is to the credit of the Australian people that we were able to survive that constitutional crisis with our social fabric basically intact. It should always be the people that vote in or vote out governments, not the Senate. As a member of the House of Representatives, I object very much to the blanket opposition which the opposition is indicating it has to these measures.

         Australians are often accused of being very insular. We forget from time to time that there is a big world out there and that Australia can be affected by overseas economies. This budget proposes a growth in the economy of some 2.75 per cent. One of the things I find most pleasing about this budget, including the budget proposals, is the fact that the figures are quite conservative. We ought to contrast the growth that is occurring in the Australian economy—which we would all like to see much stronger—with that of other OECD countries.

         I will run through some figures for the benefit of the House. Austria is not growing but is contracting by 0.6 per cent; Belgium is not growing but is contracting by 0.7 per cent; Iceland is not growing but is contracting by 1.8 per cent; the Netherlands is not growing but is contracting by 0.03 per cent; Spain, with a booming economy, is not growing but is contracting by 0.06 per cent; Sweden is not growing but is contracting by 0.2 per cent; Switzerland is not growing but is contracting by 0.5 per cent. All European OECD countries are not growing but contracting by 0.1 per cent. The OECD suggests that in 1993 Australia is going to grow—not contract—by 2.9 per cent.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Lest honourable members feel that I have left out some of the major economies in Europe, I point out that Germany is not growing but is contracting by 1.9 per cent; France is not growing but is contracting by 0.7 per cent; Italy is not growing but contracting by 0.2 per cent; and the UK is growing by 1.8 per cent—nearly half of the Australian growth rate. I think it is very important that, notwithstanding the difficulties we are having with the economy, all Australians appreciate the fact that by OECD standards we are growing quite dramatically; in fact, we would all like to see Australia grow even further.

         We, in Australia, tend to lose sight of what is happening overseas. Petrol increases have caused a certain amount of angst. For the benefit of the House, I will demonstrate what is happening with petrol prices and petrol taxes in other countries. In Norway, petrol is $1.72 per litre, and the government take is 67 per cent; in Portugal, the price is $1.49 per litre, and the government take is 75 per cent; in France, the price is $1.41 per litre, and the government take is 77.4 per cent; in Germany, the price is $1.37, and the government take is 73.3 per cent; and in the UK the price is $1.15, and the government take is 68.7 per cent.

         Honourable members will see from the figures that I have quoted that Australian petrol prices compare more than favourably with prices in those OECD countries. We tend to get the argument that, because Australia is an island continent with such large distances to travel, very cheap petrol prices should be government policy. I have some sympathy with that point of view. It is fair enough to say that any increase in the price of petrol is reflected in general price increases.

         Having said that, I think it is also important that we remember that we are not self-sufficient in petrol. Unlike other countries, such as Brazil, we have not been able to convert to gasohol or ethanol to make our reserves go even further, and I think that is more the pity. There is a very strong economic argument, incidentally, that we should not underprice such a limited resource. We then have all the environmental arguments as to why we should make sure that other complementary and competitive forms of transport are able to compete on a fair and equal basis without trying to subsidise, effectively by low prices, the cost of road transport, whether it be passenger car, coach, truck or semitrailer. So there are some very strong environmental as well as economic arguments. I think that we should always maintain and review our current petrol pricing and make sure that we do not squander a limited resource. There are a few other things that I want to mention in the context of these bills. Firstly, I am very pleased that the government has now lowered the differential on leaded fuel from 5c in the dollar to 2c in the dollar.

         —I thank the honourable member for his interjection. I would love to say that I was in constant contact with the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and giving advice about the budget. I think it would stretch the credibility of members in this House, particularly the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh), who is at the table, if I made such an assertion. Had I been in such contact, I would have been delighted to have given them the benefit of my views. I think that it is a very healthy process that we have been able to change that decision. I welcome it, and I believe that it is particularly welcomed by the electorate at large.

         Before that interruption, I wanted to mention a few other things that I think are significant in relation to these bills. Firstly, there is a strategy of trying to get our deficit down to about 0.1 per cent of GDP. I think it is very important that people understand that the more we can reduce that deficit, the less demand the government will place on the private sector.

         One of the keystones and characteristics of this government is that we have, wherever possible, tried to fuel the economy by getting growth and jobs into the private sector. Given the fact that we are in a recession, and given our high levels of unemployment, it is entirely appropriate that much of the growth that we are seeing in the economy is coming through government spending. I am particularly pleased, representing an electorate like Chifley, to be able to see that there is a $2 billion fiscal stimulus in the budget.

         It is also true to say that we do not want to be like the Americans and cherry pick all the measures that members of the House—or the Senate for that matter—might like and agree with and reject all the bad points. We have to have a balanced package of measures. I think it has been a feature of our Australian democracy, notwithstanding the fact that we have borrowed heavily from the Americans in framing it, that we continue with this balanced approach. I am very pleased about that particular aspect as well as the overall thrust of trying to get our deficit down to around one per cent of GDP.

         Given the high levels of unemployment, this budget is providing something like $1.3 billion in labour market programs. Even when we had the high growth rates in the 1980s and the tremendous increase in the level of employment growth, it was a sad fact that only one in seven new jobs, the jobs that Labor had created, were going to the long-term unemployed. Dollars spent on long-term unemployed through special labour market programs is money well spent. As we are faced with the higher levels of unemployment, I think people on this side of the House at least will be keen to make sure that we get the cost benefits that go with spending even more money on labour market programs to meet the needs of the long-term unemployed, to keep them in touch with employment and to allow them to re-enter the work force once we get the economy buzzing along at the four to five per cent required to make a dint in the long-term unemployed.

         Some have said that they are very disappointed that more has not been done in this budget for the long-term unemployed. I think it is only fair to point out that the Prime Minister has taken the unprecedented step of setting up a special task force to look at the issues of employment and unemployment. I think it is very appropriate that we look at these issues, given the many changes in the economy. There has been a dramatic change in participation rates for women in the work force. The balance between part-time or casual employment versus permanent employment, enterprise bargaining and the productivity increases that have occurred are all factors that have added up, if you like, to larger structural unemployment.

         One of the issues that opposition members constantly raise is the level of taxation in Australia. They are always saying that we need to decrease levels of taxation. It matters not one fig that we now have the lowest level of taxation of OECD member countries. In fact, with the United States recording a slight increase, we are even lower than the overall level of taxation in the United States. But that satisfies those opposite not one whit; they want to see taxation rates driven even lower. I do not understand for what purpose.

         The shadow Treasurer is very anxious that we should have Asian levels of taxation. We can learn much from the Asian economies, the way the Asian tigers have developed and what is fuelling their terrific rate of growth. However, we should not copy their taxation levels and, in particular, eliminate our social welfare system—our safety net—that we have had a very proud tradition of encouraging. If we were to copy anything, we might look at Asian economic planning, because economic planning seems almost a dirty word in Australia. I am impressed that most countries have at least a five-year horizon for planning: for example, Indonesia has a 25-year planning horizon with five-year tranches. Unfortunately, Australia does not have that at the moment.

That is of great benefit to small business. A businessman in my electorate told me what a great difference these lower interest rates make. He was able to save something like $100,000 every quarter, and that was a terrific impact. One of the other innovations being funded by these measures in the budget is the $30 a week home-care allowance.

I am fascinated that every day in this House we get these great tours of OECD countries, especially after we have had 18 months of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) ramming it down our throats that we are part of Asia, that our future is in Asia, that we have to compete with Asia and that we have to get into the Asian markets. In the meantime, we go on this magical mystery tour around such exotic destinations as Austria, Belgium, Iceland, Spain, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland.

New Zealand has been through a pretty torrid time over the last 10 years, but it is fascinating to see what New Zealand is doing to us in the area that we are supposed to be getting into. If we look at the results that New Zealand has achieved in the last few months, it is really quite extraordinary. For the first time in 20 years New Zealand's trade is in the black and it can compete. It is giving us a whipping in those Asian markets. Why is New Zealand giving us a whipping? The reality is that New Zealand has taken the hard decisions, has fixed up its taxation system and has deregulated its labour market.

         The reality of the situation is best summed up in a quote from that guru of the Australian Labor Party, the former Minister for Tourism, the Hon. John Brown. In a submission that he made on behalf of one of his clients, he certainly summed up the situation when he said that the Labor Party's real difficulty is that it has not really matured enough to realise just what the industry was all about. He said that the Labor Party did not know the reality of the situation and that it was just part of the philosophical effort of the government to go and get the tall poppies.

         The government can go and get the tall poppies if it likes, but the reality is that there has been a maturation of the Australian accommodation industry and the hospitality industry and the results coming from these particular moves will see some massive reductions in employment. A study has been completed by the Australian Hotels Association—I regard it as a fairly conservative study—which has gone to the government and, no doubt, will go to the senate inquiry. This study spells out the situation chapter and verse.

         We do not have to have access to that study to learn of the concerns in the industry at the moment. I think honourable members would agree that the gentleman who serves as the divisional chairman for accommodation of the Australian Hotels Association, and one of the finest hoteliers in Australia, Wolfgang Grimm, summed it up this morning when he issued a press statement to Australian Associated Press pointing out what would be involved in the Sydney market alone. It is quite frightening when we see the results of that study. He says that the five-star Regent Hotel in Sydney stands to lose 250 staff; the five-star Hotel Intercontinental will have to shed 230 employees; four-star hotels such as the Hilton would shed 150 jobs; the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, the ANA Hotel, the Hotel Nikko and the Holiday Inn-Menzies Hotel would lose 40 staff each; the Park Hyatt Hotel would lose 60 staff; the Renaissance Hotel would lose 50 staff; and the Novotel at Darling Harbour would lose 37 staff.

         Why are those people going to lose staff? It is because we are told in these budget papers that the Australian Taxation Office will refer to a document headed TR93/22 as the guidelines for setting a limit on business travel. That covers the amounts that can be claimed by those Commonwealth public servants who are on a travel allowance. The fact that this government would try to relate any Public Service travel allowance to what happens in the real world is beyond my comprehension, for a number of reasons. One reason is that there are so many different divisions of the allowances made for travel because they are calculated on salary ranges. There are differences in the level of travel from city to city and from state to state. There are even differences in the travel allowances allowed from town to town.

         If we consider the application of this measure and the general mood of travel, there is really no relationship between the amount given and the reality of trying to live in some of these cities. I will explain that a little bit further. When we look at the total daily allowance that is allowed in Sydney for public servants whose annual salary is in the range of $61,147 to $102,399, it is interesting to note that they are allowed $193.60 a day. That allows $116 for accommodation, $62.35 for food and drink and $15.25 for incidentals. If they go to Melbourne, they get $201.60 a day; if they go to Brisbane, it is $176.60; if they go to Canberra, it is $161.60; and so it goes on.

         Out of the capital cities we find some other gems. There are two weighted differences between certain country towns and other country towns. For example, there is a rate of $99 per day in Broome. I suppose if we wanted to stay in the youth hostel in Broome with the backpackers we would probably get by for $99 a day. When one goes to Norfolk Island it is $87 a day. If ones goes to Yulara, it is $167.50 a day. There are other rates for other areas. If an employee has an income below that magic figure of $61,147, the rates come down dramatically.

Quite often the reality is that businesses undertake their conferences and the physical work that they are required to do in the same hotel. The situation really does not come into it. Yet we are told by this government that the reality is that people are just trying to rip off the system. We are told that the government is really after the tall poppies who are paying $1,400 a night for a suite.

         It is worse than that. The bottom line is that the FBT will also be imposed on conventions held in Australia. International conventions are a big market. Domestic conventions are a big market. Conventions were worth about $1.6 billion to Australia last year. The market is so big that Australia has put enormous investment into specialised convention centres. Just last week we saw in the Queensland budget that $87 million has been allocated this year alone to begin the Brisbane convention and exhibition centre at South Bank and that money has also been given to the Cairns convention centre.

This industry will not be allowed to die. One of the first things that will happen is that there will be package deals organised all over the place which will incorporate the price of the airfare, the cost of accommodation and the cost of all meals. I guess that this will apply, too, to straight business travel. The first thing someone would have to do would be to buy the package from the airlines. Nobody has been able to tell me at this stage how we will get around this one.

He could be told, `We have this special for you'. The special would be at a particular price, the principal part of which would be the full listed airfare. If the total cost of the trip was $500 or $600, which may or may not be the allowance, you can bet your bottom dollar he would have the full airfare included in the price and the accommodation package would be thrown in for peanuts, and it would be balanced out somewhere else. So it will not be as hard as all that to get around the set-up. We will see this happen particularly with conventions if we are not to see the convention industry go out the door.

Do honourable members know how many new properties we have under construction in Australia? The answer is nil. The reason it is nil is that there are no incentives to build new properties. We do not have the taxation incentives that our rivals in South-East Asia have.

In the hotel industry there is a rule of thumb that the room rate should be one per cent of the cost of construction of the room. At the moment in Australia a room cannot be built for less than half a million dollars, which means that the room rate should be $500 a night. The reality is that no-one is getting those prices.

         Look at some of the allowances proposed under TR93/22. The cost of providing three meals a day is really quite unreasonable. The restaurants will suffer. Whether we like it or not, the reality is that the staff involved in the restaurant industry will suffer too because the hospitality industry has the capacity to be able to provide lots of jobs in the shortest possible time.

         If the FBT were lifted tomorrow in its entirety, 22,000 jobs could be created immediately in the restaurant industry. But the government is not interested in that; it would rather see those jobs go. This provision will have a bouncing effect throughout the Australian economy. Taxi drivers, everyone who is involved in the tourism and hospitality industry, will ultimately suffer from this particular move.

         I appeal to the government to take note of the Senate inquiry and make sure that that examination really brings out the ridiculousness of this particular move. I hope that the government then has the guts to do one of two things: either drop this particular provision completely; or, if it must go ahead with it, at least get to a stage where we have some decent limits available. While the Hyatt hotel chain and the tourism task force have suggested that $600 a night is not a bad place to start—it probably would be negotiable—let us start at the ministerial limit of $300 a night and not the $150 a night that is proposed in this stupid measure.

         —It is always a pleasure to follow the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull). I accept that he has a very genuine interest in the tourism industry. Indeed, he was one of the very few members of the opposition who drew attention to the effects of the goods and services tax as it would apply to the tourism industry. Of course, we all know that, if the opposition were sitting on this side of the House and we now had a goods and services tax, it would be quite devastating and the tourism industry would now be arguing with a liberal government about getting some changes. I wonder whether the honourable member would have crossed the floor of the House to vote against the goods and services tax. But I take on board what the honourable member said because I accept and understand his deep and enduring interest in tourism and its effect on Australia.

         I also have to draw to the attention of the House the effect of the fringe benefits tax. I well recall standing in this place when we brought in the original fringe benefits tax. I recall vividly newspaper headlines around Australia claiming that we would destroy the hospitality industry.

         Twelve months after the original fringe benefits tax was brought in, it is now history that in fact the restaurant industry boomed. Twelve months after the introduction of the fringe benefits tax there were more restaurants in Australia than before it was introduced. That shows the difficulty we all have in this place in forecasting the effect of taxation changes. As I will say later, I certainly have concerns about some of the changes proposed by the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill and cognate bills.

It never ceases to amaze me when I hear those opposite in this place—and I have had the advantage of reading some of the speeches made last week by members of the opposition—talk about history and where they stand on matters of taxation principle. I have only to go back to the 1970s and section 260 of the then Income Tax Assessment Act and a former Attorney-General of this House and a former member of the Liberal Party of Australia who became the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia. He almost single-handedly—accompanied by fellow judges such as Sir Harry Gibbs—tore section 260 asunder, with the total compliance of the then conservative government.

         It was only very recently during the 1993 federal election campaign that a goods and services tax at the rate of 15 per cent was going to be visited upon the Australian people.

         My opponent, the then member for McEwen, Mrs Bailey, for more than 12 months told the people in her electorate that a tax on necessities would be good for them and not regressive. She told them that such a tax would do them no harm at all and that the price of bread would rise by only the GST rate of inflation, which, depending on which part of Fightback one read, ranged from 3.9 per cent to 4.4 per cent. So for 12 months we had this debate in the electorate of McEwen, with Mrs Bailey saying that under a GST the price of bread would rise by only the rate of inflation.

Going into the election there was enough politics on the other side to force that change, and suddenly we were told that a tax on necessities would indeed be regressive. I am pleased that message finally got through and some changes were made.

Measures must be taken to repair that side of the revenue base. While I accept measures that will do that, I would much prefer to see more progressive, rather than regressive, tax measures.

         In 1985, when we first looked at introducing sales tax at the rate of 10 per cent, the Victorian parliament of the day conducted a major inquiry into the Victorian wine industry and a report was tabled. That report included a major discussion on the elasticity of the domestic price of wine. In April of the same year, another major report on the wine industry, prepared by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, was tabled in this House, partly in response to the grape prices and vine pool proposals of 1985-86. That report also indicated the very low elasticity of the domestic price for wine. The long-term elasticity was minus 1.2 in the Victorian report and minus 1.3 in the federal report. In more recent days, a report was released in South Australia and we have also seen the release of the Sharp report, both of which indicated the same type of figures: in domestic price terms there is very low elasticity in wine prices.

         The Australian wine industry is, without question, a major new export area. It is estimated that in the next decade or so $1.2 billion will be spent on new capital in the industry, and by the turn of the century we will be exporting close to $1 billion of wine. In the electorate of McEwen there is a large number of new small vineyards. In the King Valley, where we are currently growing tobacco, the tobacco growers are looking for alternative crops because of this government's tax increases and the huge tax increases imposed by the Victorian government after Jeff Kennett's backdown on his promise not to increase taxes for tobacco growers.

         One of the new crops in the King Valley is grapes for wine production. It costs approximately $10,000 per acre to establish a vineyard. In addition, there is the lead-up time for the vine to grow and for the viticulturist to get to work before one can expect a reasonable crop. Then one has to carry the capital costs of the wine making equipment. It seems to me that people are being forced out of tobacco production because of the restrictions and costs involved. However, while one of the few options for them is to move to wine production, we are increasing taxes and inhibiting their capacity to do that.

It is a failure because it hurts the poor more than the rich. It throws to the winds those words of Bob Hawke about restraint with equity in difficult times. Even in terms of its own predictions about job opportunities it is a failure because it predicts no improvement in Australia's chronic unemployment figures for the next 12 months. Above all, it is a failure because, at a time when this country is crying out for leadership and direction, it offers only injustice, confusion and broken credibility. The very stuff of leadership is lacking, absent, not there. It is being recognised as a failure by everyone around the country, even surely now by those who crafted it.

         The budget fails to recognise the urgent and desperate need in this country to get serious about developing an internationally competitive economic environment. Taxes on production inputs not only remain, they are increased. By that standard alone the judgment must be that it trends in precisely the wrong direction. The government boasts—indeed, we have heard it in this place repeatedly today—that interest rates have come down in this country. They have done so compared with what we had in the past, but where are they by international standards? What do our farmers, manufacturers and small businessmen have to pay in comparison with those abroad with whom they must compete for international market share?

         The previous speaker, the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland), talked about the supposedly inflationary pressures that Fightback would have imposed on the Australian economy, but we have heard precious little about what this budget, in its own terms, predicts about inflationary pressures. Those pressures would be far more significant than those in Fightback and they would be coming at a worse time than we could ever imagine for the introduction of such pressures. We couple that with the other prevailing economic circumstances and find that we are looking at higher interest rates at the very time when we need to get them down to the sorts of levels that our competitors abroad are enjoying.

         I turn to some of the specifics that concern the people whom I represent. I refer first to the hike in fuel excise. It does not seem to have had a lot of attention focused on it, but the hike in fuel excise will add massively to the costs of the agricultural, forestry and food processing industries. In fact, it will add something in the order of $290 million—or would have done so in the form of the original budget estimates. Now, presumably, that has come down a bit, but not by very much. We heard this nonsense earlier from a previous speaker about how the GST was going to add to costs. Apparently, he has not read that the clear intent was to remove the costs of indirect taxation on industry, because the indirect taxation burden on industry is a tax on prosperity, exports and jobs. He, apparently, is not aware of that, chooses not to be aware or does not understand. But these industries, according to the government's own Treasury estimates, are currently paying more than $1.5 billion in fuel excise every year, even allowing for the diesel fuel rebate where it exists.

         The Australian Maritime Association has predicted that the added fuel costs arising out of this budget will add $16.1 million a year to the cost of coastal shipping. This is absolutely amazing. Waterfront reform was supposed to have been where this government had got it all right—not to mention shipping reform where, to give the government its dues, some real progress has been made. But we find that, after a struggle to reduce crew numbers, because each crew member adds around $110,000 to shipping costs, the government, with one budget, has saddled the industry with costs which are the same as employing another 146 crew.

Many of them now have had three or more years of business losses. They gain nothing from this budget except more costs.

         The increase in unleaded fuel alone will add close to $20 million to farm costs. The road transport forum says that the hike in the cost of diesel fuel will add $6,000 to the average annual operating costs of a semitrailer and $3 to the average family shopping basket of $70. If we were to assume that the average family out in the bush buys, say, $140 worth of groceries a week, the increase will be $6. Then add the cost of filling up the family car which, in the bush these days, is usually a six-, seven- or eight-year-old Commodore or Falcon—they are often older—and often has 300,000 or 400,000 kilometres on it these days.

         —Where is it? Are some of them perhaps a little like watermelons—green on the outside and red on the inside? So there is little help for rural people in this budget. Looking at the expenditure side, we find only $474 million of Commonwealth funds is outlaid for agriculture, forestry and fishing. While the budget actually shows $1.638 billion will be spent, farmers themselves will contribute $723 million in taxes and charges, and $440 million is the diesel fuel rebate—or what remains of it. Of the actual contribution of $474 million, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy uses 20 per cent. It is hard not to conclude that the government is not very serious about cutting its own expenditure. The cost of running DPIE has increased by 11 1/2 per cent, from $86 million last year to $95 million this year, and we find that, despite reforms in AQIS, its outlays have increased by $18.3 million.

         The balance of the money for primary industry consists mainly of dollar for dollar research and development grants.

We have heard a lot about some of the other direct measures which are going to hit farmers. There will be a tax on wine, and now we hear people opposite saying, `Maybe this isn't such a good idea. Maybe this is going to hurt some of my constituents. Maybe it is going to wind back on regional development'.

         The Garnaut report, in common with the overviews of this issue of virtually everybody else in the wool industry, acknowledges the need to do significantly more to boost the standing and sales of, and the demand for, Australian wool. On the backs of very low prices, the woolgrowers cannot afford to keep funding for promotion at adequate levels. In fact, in the wool industry's hour of great need, we are now spending on the promotion for this magnificent product—a product that, until as recently as three years ago, earned virtually $1 in every $10 of Australia's export dollars—about the same as that spent on promoting Kit Kat internationally. Farmers cannot afford more money. The international processors appear to be stalling and now the government is—I would suggest, very much against the national interest—apparently not prepared to continue funding for wool promotion.

The government suggests that parents can get assistance through the social security additional family payments scheme.

         In short, the deal stitched up between the Australian Democrats and the government is nothing but a bandaid for the growing cancer blighting Australian businesses. The government superficially addresses the more obvious points of regressivity but fails absolutely to address the underlying illnesses in our economy. While it apparently took just a few minor changes to the budget to convince the Democrats to sell out and pass it, the coalition believes that the total philosophy of the budget needs changing, because it is currently inappropriate. We must reduce costs on our productive sector so that it can compete abroad and at home against imports. Only then will businesses start employing the one million Australians out of work. Only then will the sell off of farms, in both its narrow and broader sense, slow. Only when the situation starts to turn around will we see again the stability and opportunities that the lucky country once offered to all its people.

         When the Assistant Treasurer presented the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill on 17 August he emphasised a number of elements of the legislation. These include: the personal tax cuts, the low income rebate, the Medicare levy, unused annual leave and unused long service leave payments, taxation of credit unions, taxation of friendly societies and other registered organisations, car parking expenses for the self-employed, non-deductible expenses, fringe benefits tax, excess domestic travel and sales tax. The particular provisions intended by the government were identified by the Assistant Treasurer in his second reading speech. Since then a number of changes have been considered by the government and have been accepted. I understand that later, during the committee stage, the government will move a number of amendments to give effect to those changes.

         The low income rebate to taxpayers whose taxable income for the 1993-94 and subsequent income years is less than $23,200 is to be increased from $100 to $150. Lump sum payments for unused annual leave and unused long service leave which accrued to 17 August 1993 will continue to attract a concessional rate of tax. There are other adjustments to the general provisions of the budget and one adjustment to the provisions of last year's budget. As a result of concerns that have been expressed by interested groups in the community, the government has taken the opportunity to introduce some changes.

         It is important for us to realise when considering changes of this kind that government budgets are not just economic packages. If we happened to live in a totalitarian society, they could well be. We happen to live in a liberal democracy, in a social democracy, and we have in government at the present time a social democratic party—the Australian Labor Party. The Labor Party for the 100 years of its existence, if it has done nothing else, has certainly been a political party which has responded to the aspirations and the concern of the Australian people. It is for that reason that the Australian Labor Party has continued to exist for 100 years.

         —In fact, the first workers government in the history of the world was in Queensland. It only lasted for six days because it was a composite coalition government. Honourable members will understand the trauma associated with the establishment of that government. Those people who had been in government believed that their right to govern would continue forever. Suddenly a government came into existence as a result of a coalition in Queensland and, as the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) quite rightly observed, it was the first workers government in the history of the world.

         It has been different since then. One of the reasons why the Australian Labor Party has continued to exist as a great social democratic party is that it has been responsive. It has recognised that in the process of economic management and developing budgets at whatever level of government there are also important social and political considerations, important social and political dimensions and imperatives that should be brought to bear on the construction of any financial or economic statements. While ever we live in a liberal democracy that is the way it should be. It is not a sign of weakness or capitulation; it is a recognition of the political realities and the social imperatives which drive Labor Party governments and which provide, to a very large extent, our motivation.

         People in countries like Australia do have the opportunity through their party political representatives, through opposing and competing political parties, the media, pressure groups and sectional interests of various kinds, to influence the management of the public sector. But while it is important that a government, in the construction of its budget and in modifications built into that budget, does respond to circumstances of that kind, the integrity of the budget itself needs to be maintained. It needs to be responsive to economic circumstances. It needs to be coherent, comprehensive and consistent. It needs to reflect the government's general approach to public sector management and to economic policy.

          Increasingly, a budget needs to indicate the direction of government policy to provide greater certainty to the community about what direction the government intends to take, what sort of goals it is setting, what type of considerations underpin those concerns and those approaches. The government needs to provide clear indications about what it hopes to achieve over time. That is what this legislation is about—a deficit reduction program.

         The government's commitment towards the deficit reduction involves a commitment to reduce the budget deficit to one per cent of GDP by 1996-97; that is, to less than $6 billion compared with the $15 billion that it would otherwise have been. That involves a $9 billion cut between now and 1996-97. While the government has established that as its general direction and commitment, there is no way in the world that we can forecast with any certainty what the deficit would be in 1996-97. What we can do is precisely what we have done; that is, to indicate a direction and an objective, and establish a principle. That is what this legislation will do.

In last year's budget the deficit was forecast at $13.4 billion and it turned out to be about $14.6 billion—which was not too far out except that during that period the deficit had been revised to $15.9 billion.

         They also said there would be a reduction in the differential between leaded and unleaded fuel from 5c a litre to 2c a litre.

People having eye tests will continue to be eligible for Medicare rebates. I agree and welcome that measure.

         Other changes have been announced separately. The retrospective element of the unrealised capital gains on shares for pension entitlement purposes has been removed as well. While the amount might not be great, it is important that the government do that to keep faith with people who clearly had made decisions concerning their retirement on the basis of the provisions as they existed before. There was an element of unfairness in making retrospective decisions which, in some cases, would cause people who had made their retirement plans on the basis of what they expected to realise to be thousand of dollars behind.

         The combined effect of those measures that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer announced is that the prospective addition to the deficit for 1996-97 will be in the order of $380 million. So, instead of the deficit being 1.1 per cent of GDP, it will rise to 1.2 per cent of GDP.

         It is a great pity for the Australian people that they did not take the advice that had been flowing into government members' offices and to the opposition; we have been hearing it from every quarter. The Treasurer always said that the budget was not negotiable, but, as he found, the reality in the Senate is that he has had to negotiate a number of times and make adjustments, and we see these flowing through from time to time to this House. The government says that the budget now reflects the concerns of Australians about its initial presentation. This is absolute nonsense, as we all know. These bills should not be called deficit reduction bills but tax increase bills, because this budget will be part of a strategy that will deliver the Labor government an additional $32 billion in tax revenue over the next four years. This compares with only $5.2 billion extra over the last four years. If we do the figures we can see that with bracket creep the government is really going to increase its revenue take. Yet the Prime Minister had the gall to say, not long ago, in November 1992:

The revenue from asset sales has not come to fruition on the promised amounts suggested over the last four years. The promised profits from the Reserve Bank of $3 billion are huge in dollar terms, but the way the dollar has been falling in recent days, the Reserve Bank might need to use those reserves to prop it up. We still have a budget which the Treasurer says is a budget for jobs; however, in the fine print we know that the budget is estimating that unemployment will remain at 10.75 per cent.

We still have a budget that will result in Australia's low level of business investment—17 out of the 24 advanced industrialised nations—remaining at this poor figure. The investment possibilities in Australia under the present Labor government are an indictment of the government.

         The budget will not alter the low growth, high unemployment recession that Australia has been locked into, partially because of worldwide conditions—I concede that—but more due to the failure of this government to address the real reforms that would improve Australia's medium- and long-term economic position. The budget says that the economy will grow this year by 2.75 per cent. Unemployment will apparently remain very much the same at 10 3/4 per cent.

         Retail spending is a pretty good barometer of the Australian economy. Since 1990 the amount Australians are spending has increased in real terms by only 2.2 per cent. The economy remains in a slump. This will worsen if Australians are forced to pay every cent of these extra taxes.

         With the Prime Minister's repeated assurances before and during the election campaign that there would be no new taxes if the Labor Party were elected, the opposition cannot support some of the measures in this bill. The opposition is not in favour of an increase in sales tax of two per cent, with the exception of that on luxury cars. The opposition will not support increases in sales tax charged on wine from 20 per cent to an eventual 32 per cent. Some commentators have overlooked the fact that it is not just a 10 per cent increase but an extra two per cent that is being slipped in over the next couple of years.

         The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) claimed today that the opposition's decision to vote against these four measures was setting a very dangerous precedent. I do not agree with that and the opposition does not agree with it. The Labor Party has been very keen to vote against these measures historically in the Senate and, given half a chance, it would vote against us in government. To put that into perspective, whilst we are voting against four measures, that accounts for only $1.5 billion out of a total budget of about $115 billion. So we are in fact supporting 98.5 per cent of the government's budget proposals.

         The opposition's stance is responsible against a government which has acted irresponsibly in framing this budget against the election promises it put forward prior to 13 March. The government claims that the analysis of Treasury shows that the vast majority of Australians will be better off as a result of this budget. On Wednesday, Dr Neil Warren of the University of New South Wales, in relation to what the reality is, said:

        That is the reality, and the government knows it. Dr Warren suggested that many people would be only a few cents ahead if any analysis went back from 1996-97 to today and accounted for the bracket creep of higher tax rates, which would be even more significant now that inflation is expected to rise to 3.5 per cent next year. All these bills are under a cloud, and the basis of these taxation measures being put forward is being challenged by intelligent commentators.

         If the government is seeking to impose taxation, under section 55 of Australia's constitution it cannot deal with more than one subject of taxation. So again we see a government trying to overcome the difficulties in the Senate by putting the taxation and revenue measures in one bill. This bill not only deals with more than a single taxation proposal, but also it includes both income and expenditure proposals.

         Even with the foreshadowed amendments to the bill, the government admits that its supposed original target of a budget deficit of one per cent in 1996-97 will now not be met. The key plank of what the Treasurer and the Prime Minister have been saying is that they will reduce the budget deficit to one per cent. They now say that it will be 1.2 per cent. Given their previous forecasting record, this would be very optimistic indeed. Like all their arrangements, they talk about tax cuts in the future. The second group of tax cuts will be in the never-never. Who will be in government? It will not be the current Prime Minister, that is for sure. The government is offering a pie in the sky tax cut arrangement.

         The government's credibility is in tatters on the world's financial markets because of its abject failure to stop yet another rise in government expenditure this year. The much heralded tax cuts, which were l-a-w during the election campaign, have been put off for two weeks, which has quite an impact on the government's final arrangements. Not only that, the government is suggesting that lower income earners are only second-class citizens because this group has to wait until it puts tax returns in to get its $100. But the government was very kind to lower income earners. It now gives them $150. It is so good of the parliamentary secretary to make that adjustment. After they have paid their tax and put in their tax returns the government will give them back $150, just to keep the backbench and the parliamentary secretary, who is at the table, happy.

         The bottom 20 per cent of income earners in Australia spend about 3.1 per cent of their income on petrol and the next 20 per cent spend about 3.6 per cent. In contrast, the top fifth of income earners spend only 2.7 per cent. So we see from those figures that the government has also attacked the low income earners in the way in which it has increased fuel tax excise in this last budget measure. Government members are making it difficult for their own constituency—the low income earners and those persons who are driving the older motor cars.

He referred to the fact that there are some people in Australia—and in this debate—who would like to see us adopt the sort of tax rates applicable in Hong Kong; there are some others who would like to see us adopt the sort of services available in Sweden; there is a third group that wants to do both at the same time.

The budget provides for a deficit in this financial year of approximately 3.8 per cent of gross domestic product. That compares favourably with recent budgets. In last year's budget we had a deficit of 3.6 per cent. The budget proposes that by 1996-97 the deficit will be reduced to 1.2 per cent of GDP. That is an attainable target, and it is one which most countries around the world with whom we want to compare ourselves would be green with envy to achieve.

         Against that, we measure our performance in the last financial year with a budget deficit of 3.6 per cent, and a projected deficit in this budget of 3.8 per cent. A simple cursory look at those figures demonstrates the responsible fiscal management that this Labor government has put in place in managing our economy. It is little wonder that we are in a better position than most of those countries to which I have referred, because it was not that long ago that we returned a surplus budget. In fact, the Labor government with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) as Treasurer returned four surplus budgets. Some people on the opposition might say, `So what?'. The facts of life are that they happen to be the only four surplus budgets this nation has had from its central government.

         In all the years that the Liberal Party was in office since it was formed by Bob Menzies, it did not have a surplus budget on a single, solitary occasion. It should be remembered that we are talking about the period of the post-war boom—of the 1950s and 1960s—when the going was pretty easy economically. We did not have to be too clever to run an economy in growth mode. Throughout that period of enormous growth in the 1950s and the 1960s, when Bob Menzies and the lazy Liberals ran the country, not once did they manage to get a surplus when they were on the treasury bench of our national parliament. The Liberal Party's track record gives it no credibility in any debate about macro-economic policy. As Fightback demonstrated last year, when it comes to talking about micro-economic policy and social welfare, the views of the Liberal Party are still well and truly out of kilter with what Australians want.

That is recognised around the world and it is recognised in the international markets, even if it is not recognised by the opposition. As the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), who is at the table, commented earlier, today Standard and Poor's confirmed Australia's AA rating. I think even more important than the AA rating was its forecast for the future which went from being a negative forecast to a stable forecast for the Australian economy. That is something in which I think the government and the people of Australia can take some comfort.

Of course, those opposite were going to abolish Medicare and do all the other things they undertook to do; quite obviously that would be the only way those sorts of savings could be generated.

         Other measures have been included in the budget which have assisted low income families. In that respect I think the Prime Minister's comments in question time on 1 September illustrate the point quite well.

         Earlier the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) lamented the propensity on this side of the House to refer to the OECD. One of the reasons we do that is that it happens to have the statistical data to use. He seemed upset that we did not compare ourselves with New Zealand often enough. So let us look at New Zealand for a moment, and look at the tax revenue as a percentage of GDP. The OECD's most recent report shows that Australia is now the lowest taxed country in the OECD as expressed by total tax revenue as a percentage of GDP. That puts us somewhere around the 28 to 29 per cent tax rate mark. If we look at New Zealand for comparison purposes, as suggested by the honourable member for Fadden, we find its tax revenue is not the 28 to 29 per cent that Australia has; its tax revenue is of the order of 36 to 38 per cent—well above the Australian level.

         That brings me to the next issue I want to raise—the question of petrol. Petrol prices are an important matter and of concern to a lot of people. It might be useful and illustrative to look at a comparison between Australia's petrol price and that of New Zealand. The last time these surveys were conducted they showed that the price of leaded petrol in Australia was 66.8c and, because there was no differential at that time, unleaded petrol was the same. For comparison purposes, in New Zealand the price of leaded petrol at that same time was 78c, nearly 12c more, and the price of unleaded petrol was 75c. Why was there a difference? There was a difference because in New Zealand there is an additional charge on leaded petrol. In fact, there is a difference there of 3c per litre, and that is less than the price difference that this government proposes.

         If the comparison with New Zealand does not meet with the approval of those opposite, perhaps we should look back to mother England, back to Thatcher's policies and back to all that those opposite hold dear.

That is right; there was a price differential of 8.8c between leaded and unleaded petrol in the United Kingdom.

         I want to acknowledge what I believe are important improvements in the budget papers. The changes to the long service leave tax on accrued long service leave are welcome. The important continued inclusion of eye tests within Medicare was widely supported in the community and fits very comfortably with the Labor Party's traditional policy platform. I note that the government's changed handling of shares held by pensioners has also been well received in the community without in any way diminishing the overall economic responsibility of the budget.

         What does the government do? It just makes it more difficult for the battler. The government does not achieve much for the battlers of Australia. The government was worried about its election promises, so it brought them forward, gave people half of the promises, did a bit of a juggle around and blew the deficit out to around $16 1/2 billion, maybe $17 1/2 billion. Most commentators think the deficit is really $17 1/2 billion because one has to allow for the bit of extra inflationary pressure as a result of the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          One Nation

Assessing the amendments to these taxation deficit reduction bills, one can see that the deal done with the Democrats really has brought forward the period in which the excise on leaded fuel will be raised. It has brought it forward six months from February 1995 to August 1994. So, under this proposal, people will have to pay more sooner; yet there is supposed to be a whole bunch of equities in there for everybody. I just do not know how the sums work out.

         We have heard for a while—particularly since the budget, of course, but for 10 years before that—prediction after prediction from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), first as Treasurer and secondly as Prime Minister. Each of those predictions, without fail, has been proved to be false. So why would anybody, either within the Labor Party or outside the Labor Party, and particularly the Australian people, give him any credence whatsoever for any statement that he would make? He has proved to be utterly wrong in all of those predictions and there is absolutely no doubt that he will be wrong in the predictions that he has made about this present budget—mark 1, mark 2, or mark 3 which we still have not heard about.

If it were not so tragic, it would be humorous—the way this government has treated the Australian people and the absolute absurdity of this budget process. It is something that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Affairs (Dr Theophanous), who is sitting at the table on behalf of the government, should feel very strongly about because, amongst other things, he has a certain reputation for being a man of some principle in matters economic and other things. It must be very difficult for him to sit there and interject from time to time because it is an absolute travesty of a process that this government is subjecting the Australian people and this parliament to in its deliberations about budget mark 1, 2 or 3.

         The government went into the election with a clear and unambiguous promise not to increase taxes. Within months, all of that, as we have seen, has been thrown aside. The government has introduced a budget which increases fringe benefits tax, will increase the tax payable on accrued annual and long service leave, although there have been some changes there, will increase the tax liability of credit unions and friendly societies—the government must be very proud of that—and will increase the price of a wide range of consumer goods by increasing their wholesale sales tax rates. Remember what a terrible, dreadful thing an indirect tax was? What has the government done? It has whacked this tax up right across the board. The budget will also increase the price of wine and cider and will increase the price of tobacco and petroleum products. That is the betrayal of the Australian people, and those opposite know it.

         The Prime Minister promised us no increased taxation. But not only have he and his Treasurer brought down a budget which is dominated by a wide range of tax increases, but those increases will have their greatest impact on lower income Australians. That is the fact of the matter. Government members, when they went back to their electorates after the introduction of the budget, found—because I found it in my electorate and they would have found it in spades—that the people whom they represented got in touch with them and said, `Hang about, I thought you were supposed to represent us, the lower income people in the Australian community.

The impact is disproportionately on those very people who were, poor souls, the true believers. They gave their trust to the Prime Minister on 13 March. He is known now throughout Australia as a person whose words people cannot trust. He will never be trusted again. He is a person who has shown that anything he says has a use-by date on it of about half an hour after he says it. Any predictions that he makes will simply not come true.

         We have before us this evening three bills—the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill, the Customs Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill and the Excise Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill—which are in total breach of the ALP's election commitment. The bills are grossly inequitable in that they disproportionately fall on the lower income Australians, and none of them will do anything to put Australia back on the road to economic recovery and higher levels of employment. We have all been betrayed. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer, to compound their problems, believed that they could circumvent hostility to these taxation increases in the Senate by lumping them all into one bill and calling it a deficit reduction bill. Under the precedents in this parliament, they believed that this would force the opposition and the minority parties into acceptance of the total package. What they did not count on was the uncertainty which has arisen over the constitutionality of their actions. This argument centres on the interpretation of section 55 of the constitution which states:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Laws imposing taxation shall deal with the imposition of taxation, and any provision therein dealing with any other matter shall be of no effect. Laws imposing taxation . . . shall deal with one subject of taxation only . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        The question of whether the bill deals with the imposition of taxation is also important as regards section 53 of the constitution. It states:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Senate may not amend proposed laws involving taxation . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        The Prime Minister is insisting that the bill cannot be amended. He is also claiming that the bill does not impose tax and can, therefore, include more than one taxation subject. If that is the case, then the Senate can amend the bill. To put it quite simply, the Prime Minister has outsmarted himself, and he is now marooned between section 55 and section 53 of the constitution. He simply cannot have it both ways. If he wants one bill to include all of his taxation measures, then those measures are not an impost and the bill may be amended by the Senate. If he is correct in saying that the Senate cannot amend the bill, then he is admitting that the bill does contain taxation imposts. It is then unconstitutional in that more than one taxation measure is included in that bill. We all know that the opposition has announced its intention to refer the constitutional validity of the bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. This has been supported by the Australian Democrats. The matter could end up in the High Court.

         I turn now to the detail of the legislation. I have to say that the budget has generated more letters and calls from my constituents than any other that I can recall in my many years in this parliament. The budget's proposal to increase taxation retrospectively on lump sums for accrued annual leave and long service leave has produced the greatest volume of concern, although the wine tax, the sales tax increases generally, and the credit union measures come a very close second. As we know, the government has backed down on its accrued leave proposal, and it has made a number of other concessions because of pressure from the Australian Democrats and Independent senators. As I said at the start of the speech, further concessions are possible. I would be very grateful to the honourable member for Brisbane or to the parliamentary secretary if they could inform me and the House whether there have been any later changes, since this bill has been debated in this chamber, to the possible final make-up of the budget.

         The proposed removal of certain taxation exemptions for credit unions is another betrayal. I remind members of the government that this was thoroughly examined by the so-called Martin banking inquiry. The present Speaker of the House of Representatives chaired that inquiry. It was agreed by participants in that inquiry, by both Labor and coalition members alike, that the exemption from company tax for credit unions should continue. I read that there is a possibility that this may be the case, but we have not heard the final outcome of that little scenario yet.

         The government went into the election with the credit unions believing that the exemption would continue. But there was not to be a bit of it. It was another post election betrayal, and all for relatively insignificant amounts of revenue. The 55 per cent increase in sales tax on wine defies commonsense at a time of economic hardship in Australia—particularly for an industry that has been one of Australia's most impressive export achievers. The industry itself seems agreed that this increase will result in reduced domestic sales of between nine and 13 per cent. It will be a factor likely to discourage, rather than encourage, future export sales.

         Like a number of other members, I am well aware of the case put forward for equality of treatment for all branches of the alcoholic beverages industry. But commonsense alone should have suggested that now is the most inappropriate time to attempt to achieve that equality. It is a nonsense to talk about equality between the various branches of the alcoholic beverages industry, because the making of wine is significantly different to the brewing of beer or any of the other alcoholic beverages that we partake of. Winemaking is a primary industry; it is not something that can be turned on or off at a moment's notice. Once the vines have been planted and the grapes have been harvested, the product is there. It cannot just be turned on and off as a brewery can be. It is simply not possible. To talk about equality between the various branches of the alcoholic beverage industry is, quite simply, to reveal a total ignorance of the way these things operate.

         The wine tax increase is indicative of the malaise that now pervades this government. It does not understand the psychology of the business community; it has failed to realise that, to achieve an internationally competitive export-oriented industry, the business community has to be encouraged into new directions, to be guided towards the attainment of an outward-looking culture. Given our 200 years of isolation and insulation, the process requires both commitment and skill over the longer term. Short-term expediencies, such as a wine tax in the very trough of a recession, are the very antithesis of what is needed for a burgeoning wine export industry. We have a bright spot on our export industry scene. What does this government do? Firstly, it does not understand what it is doing, and secondly it whacks the industry with this huge increase in taxes.

What do we have now? We have sales tax increases right across the board. The honourable member for Brisbane can say that it is only one per cent; it will go up again; it is designed to go up again. Is it not a terrible thing? All those things which the government railed against us for—food and laundry items—will go up. What a dreadful thing that the opposition was proposing! What is the government doing? It is whacking taxes up. Government members should be ashamed of themselves.

         The tax on petroleum products is a fascinating one as well. We have heard again from the honourable member for Brisbane about the various aspects of taxes in the UK and in New Zealand. I would have thought that even he would have realised that the physical dimensions of Australia are just a fraction different from those in the UK or in New Zealand. But it does not worry him in his analysis of the tax. He is a loyal man for the government. He is delighted to support these measures introduced by his government that he will be stuck with.

         I turn to the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill and point out to the House that just as the contents of the bill are deceitful, so is the title. It has nothing to do with reducing the budget deficit. It is simply an inappropriate cluster of measures to increase taxation on a wide range of products and services commonly consumed and used by ordinary Australians.

         The government insists that it is part of a program to reduce the budget deficit to one per cent of gross domestic product by 1996-97. The projected budget deficit for 1993-94 is already higher than the budget outcome for 1992-93, and the 1996 goal can only be achieved with economic growth of a magnitude that the majority of responsible commentators tell us is most unlikely.

         It took almost a year for the One Nation projections to be well and truly discredited. It took about four months for the Prime Minister's pre-election promises to be discredited. It has taken less than a fortnight for the 1993-94 budget to be rejected wholesale by its own supporters. So much for the validity of its forward projections. Like all the government's recent economic projections its forecast for 1996-97 is worthless, and the most likely scenario is ongoing mismanagement that leaves Australia with a mounting debt, outgoing balance of payments difficulties and—this is the most tragic part of all—unemployment stuck at close to the one million mark.

         —I will be the last speaker on the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill—which is a great pity, in view of its importance, but perhaps it does not really matter. We are debating a bill with a false title, and the full details of the bill are not before us. As the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) said, it is likely to be changed in any case. When we are debating a bill like this, it scarcely gives us much comfort when we think of the potential illegality of the bill itself and the manner in which it has been prepared and presented to this parliament.

         I will deal with the falseness of the title first. I think it is important for us to realise that this deficit for 1993-94 will be $2 billion greater than the deficit for 1992-93. If it were not for the fact of asset sales worth some $2,400 million, that deficit would be nearly $4 1/2 billion greater than it was last year. For that reason alone it is an absolute falsehood to bring to this House this budget deficit reduction bill.

But it never makes comparison with countries the size of Australia, with the population of Australia and the potential of Australia because by comparison we would fail miserably. The one exception is New Zealand—a country a lot smaller in size and population than Australia.

         The other thing that we hear so much about is the percentage of GDP. I suggest there would be very few people outside this parliament—and a lot inside this parliament—who, firstly, do not know what GDP is and, secondly, how it is achieved. I feel we should drop the GDP for something more effective, which I call an EPI—an effective productive income—because that is what is going to help Australia get out of this depression, and a depression it is. We only need to read the comments from social welfare commentators to realise this is the case. We make comparisons falsely. We make an assessment of GDP, whether it is one per cent or 1.2 per cent. People do not appreciate that what we have to do is export, or import substitutes, keep our companies on-shore and manufacture on-shore in order to produce an effective income that will reduce the size of the deficit. That is the only way around it.

It is rather interesting to note that these people have not purchased cars and replacements for years and years.

All of these amount to a tax on services and all are particularly unfavourable to country constituencies.

         It is interesting to look at some of the comparisons in the budget papers about the growing cost of the deficit. The 1992-93 deficit showed an interest component on public moneys of $5.452 billion. It is estimated to go up this year by over 20 per cent to $6.755 billion. The forward estimates go to $8.2 billion in 1994-95, $9.2 billion in 1995-96 and $9.9 billion for 1996-97. So in five years we have doubled the interest component. That is a scandal.

         Every time we talk of $1 billion of interest for servicing a debt we are talking about an increased budget deficit.

While we can ascertain from the budget papers that the government's securities on issue are $65.4 billion, the total government debt is $79.1 billion. This budget adds and budgets in the future will add to that debt. In May 1993 the Auditor-General found that federal government liabilities were $127 billion.

        As part of the government's deficit reduction strategy, the Excise Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993 proposes certain increases in the excise duty payable on tobacco, tobacco products and petroleum products. The increases to petroleum products were also designed to ensure that there would be at least a 5c differential between leaded and non-leaded petroleum products by February 1995. The Customs Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993 proposes that these increases will automatically flow through to rates of customs duty.

         These increases were the subject of some discussion by the government which resulted in some minor changes being proposed. The changes include an increase in the duty payable on tobacco and tobacco products and a decrease in the duty payable on leaded petroleum products. Tobacco was to be the subject of four increases of three per cent in February and August 1994, and again in February and August 1995.

         —It is indeed disgraceful that we on this side of the House, as members of Parliament elected to represent Australians, have not been in a position to move our amendments to this disgraceful piece of legislation, the Excise Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill, and the piece of legislation rammed through before it, the Customs Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill. This involves a vastly regressive increase in fuel taxes on Australians and a disproportionate increase in fuel tax on those who use leaded petrol.

         The Labor Party comes into this place piously and sanctimoniously and argues that it has a concern about low income Australians, but that approach is destroyed once and for all by the Customs Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill and the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill. The fact is that it is low income Australians who will disproportionately bear the burden of this regressive measure. That has been borne out by the Treasury's own analysis of these measures—an analysis which was as optimistic from the Labor Party's point of view as could be imagined, by including assumptions which could be described as little short of outrageous.

         It is also confirmed by work that has been done at the University of New South Wales. It is confirmed by work done by the Australian Institute of Taxation. The simple point is that this is a grossly regressive measure. It is also a betrayal of the Australian electorate because all those people sitting on the other side of the House, including the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary), went to the last election deceiving Australians into believing that no such measure like this would ever be introduced.

         The third point I would make about this legislation is that it comes at a time when this country has around one million people out of work and has $170 billion of net foreign debt. It comes at a time when we are running a balance of payments deficit which, in the budget papers alone, will blow out to $18 billion this year. The government has introduced measures in this legislation which will make this country less competitive, will make our exports more expensive and will make it harder for people to find jobs.

         The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) said in his budget speech that the budget was about jobs. This legislation and the other two bills rammed through before it under the guillotine are about destroying jobs. This measure will cost something like 52,000 jobs around Australia. It will make our shipping less competitive, it will make our transport systems generally less competitive and it will ensure that this country remains grossly uncompetitive. If the Treasurer thinks it is funny to cut off the debate, he is damned by his gross betrayal of the electorate—

The first highlights the success of one community organisation in improving the quality of life for two local residents; the second highlights an impending tragedy for one local welfare organisation that is unable to meet the increasing needs of many in our community who simply cannot make ends meet.

          As a community it is increasingly important that we begin to look beyond government for the provision of community services. In the Cowan electorate we are fortunate to have working amongst local residents many community based organisations that are servicing the needs of our community. In the first few weeks of becoming the newly elected federal member of parliament I was approached by two constituents. Mr and Mrs Bailey are both deaf. Mrs Bailey is profoundly deaf. As we can appreciate, this presents Mr and Mrs Bailey with additional day-to-day barriers.

          Mr and Mrs Bailey approached me seeking my support to purchase a TTY—a telephone typewriter. The TTY assists deaf people in communicating with other people over the telephone. Given the Baileys' financial position, the cost of $499 seemed beyond their reach. Instead, they requested my assistance in gaining this financial support. After many approaches to local community groups—including local Rotary, Apex and Lions clubs—I was contacted by Mr Murray Matthews of the Girradoola Lions Club.

It was encouraging that, after two years and many letters to local groups, the Baileys were finally able to obtain the use of a TTY that would provide a substantial difference to the standard and quality of their living. The Girradoola Lions Club will be holding a champagne breakfast to gain sponsorship of this project on 17 October 1993.

          In contrast, I would like to talk about the difficulties facing the Salvation Army Balga Corps. It is all too easy to forget that this evening across Australia many families go without some of the most basic of requirements—many may be cold, lonely or simply hungry. They survive out of the generosity of many of the community based organisations that provide a day-to-day service to the many needy in the community.

          All of us would be aware of the enormous and generous support extended to the community throughout Australia by the Salvation Army. Unfortunately, the availability of the professional and caring service provided by the Balga Salvation Army is under threat due to a lack of resources. Last month I was contacted by Captain John Poke of the Balga Salvation Army. It was through Captain Poke's correspondence that I was made aware of the impending crisis.

          In the 12 months to June this year, the Balga Salvation Army assisted more than 750 families. That assistance cost the Salvation Army more than $36,000.

         . . . there is an expectation from people in the community, that the Salvation Army has helped us out before, so families come to us again with that expectation that we will be able to assist them. With this severe restriction upon us, it means we will either have to find funds elsewhere or put our energies into raising monies and not into helping people.

         —In the current debate about who should be represented on our Australian currency, I want to pay tribute to a unique Australian, Mary MacKillop—a woman before her time, and indeed a woman who has been beatified and will become the first Australian saint. Surely then she is deserving of our recognition.

         Who was Mary MacKillop and what did she do? She was born on 15 January 1842 in Fitzroy, the eldest of eight children. After a prosperous start, her family became impoverished. She worked as a shop girl, a governess and a teacher. She knew and understood poverty. She had real contact and real understanding of what it was to be poor and excluded. However, she had been fortunate in being educated by her father who had studied for the priesthood in Rome before marrying her mother, Flora McDonald.

         On 19 March 1866 she and Father Julian Tennison-Woods founded the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart. They were to live in poverty and dedicate themselves to educating poor children. We need to be reminded about Catholic education in the 19th century. It was run by the church and was paid for by the states which subsidised churches to carry out education. But education, because of the lack of formation of teachers, was a very ad hoc affair, and for the poor and for girls was often non-existent.

         The Josephites organised it. Here was an ongoing structure where people were formed to be teachers, and where there really was education. It is Mother Mary's great contribution, for they were the first religious order in Australia to enter into education—with the exception of the Christian Brothers who came for a very brief time in the 1840s. Mary MacKillop and her Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart lived in poverty and dedicated themselves to educating poor and isolated children. They withstood the snobbery of the day and continued their work.

         In 1871 Mary was excommunicated for alleged subordination. The church was paternal and bishops believed that they should have control, whereas Mary, who had a much more forward thinking view, saw the need for a system in which authority would be delegated. The schools were closed, but still she held to her very strong faith and her belief in the rule of her order. The excommunication order was lifted in February 1872.

As the debate on the images on our currency units continues—I submit to you, Mr Speaker, that she is a woman upon whom we can all model ourselves—Mary McKillop should be on our currency to remind us daily of her commitment to equality of opportunity and the need for action. Australia and hundreds of Australians have much to thank her for and we need to be reminded daily of that fact.

She also failed to recognise the work being undertaken around Australia by a number of organisations affiliated with a body called NAPCAN, the National Association for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect, with which my wife Rosemary has been associated since she founded the body some years ago.

         That body, through voluntary agencies in many towns and cities around Australia, has been raising funds to combat child abuse, the figures for which, as we all know from newspapers, television and radio, are increasing at a tragically alarming rate. While it is welcome news that the federal government has developed a strategy, to date it has provided no money. While this strategy has been launched by Senator Crowley, not only has she failed to recognise the significance of the fourth annual child protection week, but she also has not recognised Operation Paradox, a police child sex abuse phone-in established in association with the founding of the national child protection week concept.

         The difficulty is that NAPCAN has been functioning on a voluntary basis. It raises funds in order to produce magazines and educational material. Indeed, pamphlets such as `It's Okay to Say No' and `Don't Shake Babies' have been produced by that organisation on a voluntary basis. Government departments throughout Australia are dependent on that material. So good is the material that it is now exported to a range of other countries.

         Yet Senator Crowley failed to recognise the efforts made by these voluntary groups and the enormous contribution made by those who, on a voluntary level, have sought to combat a phenomenon which everybody in this House and around Australia would find hard to reconcile with the concept of our society. Tragically, child abuse is on the increase. It is a reality of society where social and economic traumas are, unfortunately, becoming more and more a matter of everyday life.

         Senator Crowley was invited to participate in a joint launch of this year's new press kits. She declined to do so. I find it most regrettable that, in launching her own strategy, she seemed to be trying to attract to herself and to the government publicity which should go to others and for which, therefore, no particular pride obtains. Rather, the government's efforts need to be directed towards solving the problem.

         The figures from 50,000 or so reported cases in 1991 show that children younger than 12 months have been abused more often than those in any other group. The government should be looking at the issue of proper parenting and helping to inform children and others in society that help and care are available. I trust that the government will provide funds for the strategy in the future and recognise the efforts made by so many men and women in communities throughout this country.

         —Mr Speaker, the Ipswich railway workshops have played a tremendous part in the life of the Ipswich community for many years. Last Saturday, 4  September, I had the pleasure of attending a family day at the workshops. This day was an open day which over 10,000 people attended, from the very old to the very young, with many in family groups.

         Established in 1864 as Queensland's first railway workshops, the original workshops were sited around 1.6 kilometres south of the existing site and just north of the Bremer River. Rolling stock for Queensland's first railway line between Ipswich and Grandchester was assembled at the Ipswich workshops.

         The rapid industrial and population growth which occurred in Queensland during the late 1940s and early 1950s resulted in new workshops being built at Redbank, which have carried out all maintenance work on diesel-electric locomotives since 1958. During the 75 years that it was involved in the manufacture of steam locomotives, some 218 locomotives were built by the Ipswich railway workshops, with thousands of wagons, carriages and rail cars also being built there.

         Over recent decades, the workshops have been responsible for the maintenance of existing carriages, wagons and rail motors, as well as the manufacture of components used in other workshops throughout the state. The workshops celebrated their centenary in 1985 but, sadly, time has caught up with Queensland Rail and it is now proposed to merge the activities of the Ipswich workshops with the Redbank railway workshops complex at Redbank.

         The open day was organised as a program of events designed to inform people and stimulate their interest in the proud history of the Ipswich workshops and rail in Queensland. Events on the day included a tour of the workshop drawing office, laboratory and training centre. The program also included present day production processes, including various static and working displays. Other activities included: model trains; a first aid display; a pole top rescue demonstration; a martial arts display; vintage motor cycles; and a demonstration by the Ipswich heritage square-dancing group. A large number of local businesses also gave substantial support to the day.

         I am sure that the thousands of people who took part in the day's activities came away with an appreciation of the significant role the workshops have played in the history of the Ipswich region. For 128 years, the Ipswich railway workshops have provided employment to generations of families in the Ipswich region. The contribution of the workshops to the economy of the Ipswich region is impossible to calculate, with a large percentage of the tradesmen who served their apprenticeships at Ipswich workshops going on to work in other sectors of the Ipswich economy, including the Swanbank power station, the coal mines and private industry.

         The high level of skills developed by these tradesmen during their time at the workshops has benefited the economy of the Ipswich region enormously. Above all, the workers at the Ipswich railway workshops have contributed greatly to the economic development of Queensland. The rolling stock and components they have built, as well as the carriages and wagons on which they undertook maintenance, were all essential to the opening up of much of the state for development.

         The family day was a fitting tribute to the workshops' proud history of service to the people of the Ipswich region and to the people of Queensland. The day would not have been possible without the cooperation of the trade union movement and the efforts of the large number of workers who gave their time on Saturday. The family day committee, the trade unions and, above all else, the workers themselves are to be congratulated on their efforts in putting the day together. It proved an extremely successful day for a city that is extremely proud of its heritage.

         —It was with a great deal of concern and intrigue that I listened to the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) assuring us that the budget was all about creating jobs—then, in the next breath, he blew away thousands of jobs in the Australian wine industry as a direct result of the monumental 55 per cent increase in the sales tax on wine. In the electorate of Lyne there exists a number of quality boutique wineries which, through hard work and intelligent planning, have been achieving phenomenal success. The most notable of these wineries is Cassegrains winery which, along with the Charley Brothers winery, is providing much needed employment in the Port Macquarie area.

         The Cassegrains winery produces some of the world's best quality wine of which 40 per cent is exported, mostly to Japan, but it relies enormously on the domestic market to achieve economies of scale. As is the case with the majority of small export companies, domestic sales underpin exports. Domestic wine sales are extremely price sensitive, and this 55 per cent increase will wreak havoc on this local industry.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The concern of Cassegrains for its future is certainly not unfounded. If this tax is introduced, domestic sales are expected to drop by 31 million litres with a corresponding drop in grape demand. Along with this, the Winemakers Federation of Australia estimates a loss of export income of around $126 million per annum.

       <para font-size="-=2">
        Any change in the tax system which reduces the ability of Australian wine exporters to invest in the building of market-based assets has the potential to substantially downgrade the industry's international competitive advantage.

       <para>
        These sales tax increases will therefore place the Cassegrains family winery at a distinct disadvantage. Cassegrains survival to date has only been because members of the extended family work six days per week all year round at minimal wages. They recognise that they cannot keep this up forever and are currently trying to plan for their future.

         With the introduction of this sales tax on wine, along with all the other burdens on business which this government has introduced over the years, the future looks very bleak. This is not scaremongering. A decision to close this winery may be the only alternative open to the business.

The Prime Minister received a favourable response from China in relation to its preparedness to consider reviewing its import restrictions on wool in the context of a joint effort to exploit new marketing opportunities. The Government is currently developing a strategy to progress this issue and to ensure that it is consistent with the Government's global strategy for the wool industry it will take into account the recommendations of the Wool Industry Review Committee which has recently completed its report.

As part of the accession process China will be required to bring its trade regime into GATT consistency. This will include a removal of all non-tariff barriers that it currently applies to imports. Australia has emphasised to China that a reduction of its tariffs on wool, and elimination of its quantitative restrictions, would assist in speeding up China's application.

        (1) Yes. Section 95 of the Social Security Act provides that a person is qualified for disability support pension if he or she is permanently blind. The automatic grant of pension to permanently blind claimants also applied under the invalid pension rules. Invalid pension was replaced by disability support pension on 12 November 1991.

        The policy of granting invalid pension on the basis of blindness was given legislative authority in 1912. Successive Governments have taken the view that payments to the blind on the current basis should continue because of the special significance attached by the community to the condition of blindness.

        (2) No other permanent disabilities qualify a person automatically under the Social Security Act for disability support pension. To qualify for disability support pension, a person who is not permanently blind must have an impairment of at least 20% and a continuing inability to work.

        In most cases, a decision on a person's qualification for disability support pension involves an examination of the person by a Commonwealth Medical Officer who advises a Departmental decision-maker on the level of the person's impairment and fitness for work. Section 116 of the Social Security Act provides, among other things, that such a medical examination is unnecessary where it is manifest from the nature and extent of the person's disability that he or she qualifies for disability support pension. Departmental guidelines identify conditions and disabilities which can be considered to qualify persons for disability support pension on "manifest" grounds. Examples of such conditions include stage 4 of HIV infection (AIDS), severe brain damage and quadriplegia.
