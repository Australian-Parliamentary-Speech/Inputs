       Medicare Benefits for Optometric Examinations

       To the honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled—

        The Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully shows:
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       1.Optometry has been covered by Medicare since its inception in 1975, and currently provides eye care to over 2.4 million people each year.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       2.Removal of optometric benefits from Medicare will increase Government expenditure on eye care, as people will instead obtain their care from a more expensive source.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       3.The cost to the public of eye care will increase, both through the removal of benefits for optometric consultations and the shift to ophthalmologists who generally charge well over the schedule fee.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       4.The visual welfare of the community will suffer as people are discouraged from seeking eye care. Many eye diseases, such as glaucoma, do not produce symptoms until they are in an advanced stage. Any discouragement from seeking regular eye care will increase suffering from these diseases.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       5.The removal of benefits for optometric examinations will disadvantage children, as undetected visual disorders will adversely affect their development and school performance.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       6.Access to eye care will be reduced, particularly in rural areas, as part-time and visiting optometric practices will no longer be economically viable, and alternate care is not available.
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       We therefore request that the Parliament take steps to ensure that Medicare continues to be a universal health insurance system and that all eye examinations by optometrists are covered.

       Despite the hour at which the announcement of Sydney's successful bid occurred, in future years many Australians, particularly the younger ones, will recall that moment, because it is essentially a very significant decision.

        The area where these Olympics will occur is in the electorate of Reid. It covers an area of 760 hectares encompassing wetlands, salt marsh, woodlands and grasslands, areas of very significant environmental concern. At the same time, it has since the late 19th century had significant industrial usage. Amongst the operations that have occurred there are the Silverwater state prison and the waste transfer unit, which have a continuing presence. In previous years it has also had Sydney's major abattoirs, the Newington armament depot, the placement of which there is continuing controversy about, and from 1911 the state brickworks.

        It is a very onerous task that the state government has undertaken to ensure that there is a responsible mix of environmental protection, particularly along Haslams Creek. At the same time, it presents a very momentous opportunity for planning in regards to residential development. There will be 5,000 to 6,000 people living on the site after the conclusion of the Olympics. There is also, of course, a great opportunity for a significant number of sporting venues: the 80,000-seat stadium, the aquatic centres, the velodrome, the gymnasium and the tennis courts. They will be additional to the state sports centre and other facilities that are already very much on stream.

        It is significant that the Australian bid put a very strong emphasis on sustainable development and environmental aspects. Greenpeace was a major player in putting forward the Australian submission and it did gain international commendation for that aspect. The Australian submission covered global warming, ozone depletion and biodiversity, and it lays great emphasis on the possibility of recycling of water on the site from the residential units into the greenery around the site. We are talking of 19 hectares of remnant eucalypt forest, 100 species of Australian trees and significant casuarina plantations, and I am pleased to say that at this stage there is a very strong recognition by the New South Wales state government and its departments of the emphasis needed to be put on these aspects.

        One other thing that I am very impressed with in the efforts made so far is transportation. It is worth while noting that the Homebush Bay draft structure plan sees the early introduction of public transport as an important strategy for influencing the travel choices of those visiting and living in the area. There is in this submission by the Australian Olympic Committee a very strong emphasis on public transport. There will be the extension of the Sydney ferry service beyond Meadowbank to a new wharf near the site, there will be a ceremonial wharf site for international dignitaries and other visitors, and there is a possibility of a third wharf near Newington armament depot.

        In regard to bus services, I am pleased to state that a service will operate between Lidcombe and Strathfield.

        Light rail is seen as a possible, and I emphasise `possible', future means of transport in the area, and the planners are ensuring that near designated transit corridors there will be alignments, clearances and grades to see whether that is feasible down the track. In regard to rail, the site is very close to the Homebush station and the plan is that 50,000 per hour would be serviced by Sydney's rail system. There will be a need, therefore, for construction of on-site stations near the major events, and that is certainly in hand.

There are also clear planning proposals for cycleways to be used during the games for training and recreational purposes and to be used after the games by people going to work. There is a significant emphasis on pedestrian walkways which `will be designed more for exploration than directness'. The planning committee has clearly recognised the requirements and placed proper emphasis on the environment and on public transport.

        I turn to some local concerns in the municipality of Auburn about the Olympics.

        When we talk about Auburn municipality we have to recognise a local problem the State government has created in regard to rates. The municipality has a 25 per cent unemployment rate. That results from a very high presence of new arrivals and non-English speaking migrants. The financial result of having the Homebush site a non-rateable area up to the year 2000 is the loss of $6 1/2 million in rates between now and the year 2000. I think honourable members can appreciate the impact that will have on local service provision. It is up to the state government in particular but also federal authorities to recognise this local problem.

        The state government tried to transfer the games site into the municipality of Strathfield. When it lost that case, as of compromise it decided to pass over to the Strathfield municipality an area around the Ford factory. That will cost the Auburn municipality approximately $180,000 per year. In the short term Auburn municipality is losing out on rates from this fairly massive 560-hectare site. Maybe after 2000 that will be appreciated and there will be a solution to that problem. At the same time Auburn has lost this other area as part of the politicking around the place in regard to which municipality this site should be in.

        This unemployment level of 25 per cent has to be addressed in the lead-up to the Olympics. There are a number of options. We can look at the siting of a CES office to ensure that, despite recent promotions by the South Korean company Hyundai of its expertise in the provision of infrastructure, we try to source a significant amount of this material in Australia, that we try to ensure that not only Australian companies but more particularly local building material suppliers such as James Hardie, CSR, Boral and Smorgon have a significant input into this program.

        The legacy also must include a primary and secondary education system that delivers to our children the opportunity to learn skills and be actively involved in sport and recreational activities. Apart from the health and enjoyment aspects such renewed emphasis will bring, it will also help ensure that we produce our club, local, national and international sportsmen and women of the future. I hope that the House will excuse me now becoming parochial—

If as a nation we do not grasp the opportunity that the Paralympics will provide to us we will have lost out very badly.

        I would dearly love us to go into the year 2000 games having achieved a number of things. The first is that we have sent out a very clear message to our children that part of their future involves sport and recreational activities. Indeed, in my view sport and recreation are the keys to providing some hope for our young people. When in this country is it going to be realised that we have to offer our young people those activities? They have to be incorporated into the way we approach training and, in fact, into our whole approach to young people. That action has to start now, because such activities are the keys to hope.

        —It is indeed my pleasure not only to second this motion moved by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) but also to speak to it. Firstly, I think that we need to reiterate Australia's absolute delight at the success of the bid and congratulate all those who have been responsible for it. The shadow minister for youth, sport and recreation, the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson), suggested that he wants to keep politics out of sports; I will try to keep politics out of my contribution. I know two people in the bid team, one of whom is Bruce Baird, and I think it is fair to say that he played an outstanding role in the bid team. I must say that it came as a bit of shock to me to see that that was going to be somewhat undercut by his removal from the developing team for the games. I think we can all say, on both sides of the House, that we are very pleased that he appears to have been restored to a rightful role.

        Secondly, one of the outstanding businessmen in the western suburbs of Sydney, Jim Bosnjak, also had a role in the bid. I would like to acknowledge Jim's ongoing community service and I congratulate him particularly for his role in our Olympic bid. I would also like to place on record our appreciation of the role played by Bob Carr, the Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales, and indeed the opposition. Winning or losing a bid can be, as it turned out, a matter of one vote but, before the final team departed for the final decision, Mr Carr said, in the New South Wales state house, that, in his opinion, this was the best bid that had been prepared. He congratulated all those who had been involved with it. Bob Carr assured the Premier of New South Wales of total bipartisan support and, in the event of the bid failing, that there would be no recriminations from him or from the New South Wales state parliamentary Labor Party, and I congratulate them for that. It is all too rare in politics to see genuine bipartisan support. Again, I think we can congratulate all those who have been involved.

        For my part of the world, the western suburbs of Sydney, this has particular significance. Firstly, from a facilities point of view, the basketball will be played at the Gough Whitlam stadium in Liverpool; I understand Penrith, on the Nepean lakes, will be hosting the rowing; I believe Blacktown will be having the equestrian events; and it appears that we may also be having archery. In fact, in the electorate of my neighbour the honourable member for Lindsay (Mr Free), I would suggest to the state government that it looks at the great opportunity that the ADI site presents in terms of developing some Olympic facilities, because something like 350 hectares will be available for recreation and sporting facilities. It is not too often in Sydney that we get a site like that very close to transport infrastructure. I would urge both the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) and Blacktown and Penrith city councils to proceed quickly with the rezoning of the ADI site and together to explore the opportunities for Olympic facilities.

        I mentioned there were two reasons. I think the other reason is that, in the western suburbs of Sydney, at all ages, we are unambiguously sports mad. I think the shadow minister  indicated that there is some doubt about whether Australians are sports mad; he perhaps put one or two question marks about the proposition. Penrith City Council and Blacktown City Council have recreational facilities for sports and there is a tremendous variety and diversity of sports. This Olympic Games, I think, is going to give a new dimension and a new catalyst for people of all ages to participate in sports,  particularly for our young people.

        In terms of the stadium, I would like to offer a suggestion or a recommendation. I think it is one of the tragedies of Sydney that we do not really have a decent-size stadium anymore, particularly when the contrast is made with Melbourne. I know that many people have welcomed the fact that the Homebush stadium is going to provide seating capacity for 80,000. If we are looking to the future of sports in and beyond the year 2000, could we please re-examine the possibility of having that stadium with a capacity of up to 100,000? I think it is a real tragedy that the football stadium in Sydney can cater for only just over 40,000 people. Of course, there was a whole campaign to downsize Parramatta football stadium—more the pity. But if there is an opportunity to increase the size of the stadium at Homebush, I sincerely hope that those involved might recalculate and just look at the possibility of increasing the size to 100,000.

        It is a tragedy that the Speaker has left the chair, because I know of his interest in rugby league, perhaps a passion, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you do not share. But perhaps rugby league might in the year 2000 Olympics be listed as a demonstration sport because, unlike that other code played down south, increasingly rugby league is being played internationally. For example, Fiji is a great and recent convert to rugby league, and I know that there is a lot of work being done in South Africa. I predict that in the years to come South Africa is going to be able to field very strong rugby league teams. There is always the opportunity to have a new demonstration sport with every Olympics. If rugby league continues to grow and expand in the way it currently is doing, then there will be a lot of international visitors delighted with the skills and spectacle that is provided by rugby league. I know that the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) would strongly endorse my suggestions.

        I suppose it is a tragedy in some ways that we live in a very rationalistic economic world and, if I did not make some comment about the economic impact of the games, I guess I might be open to some criticism. It is expected, according to the KPMG Peat Marwick consultancy, that the games are likely to create something like 156,000 jobs and inject something like $7.3 billion into the national economy between 1991 and 2004, which is a tremendous amount of money. Sydney is expected to reap something like half that amount of money, some $3.56 billion, and the rest would be spread through other parts of New South Wales and the rest of Australia. It is history now that the bid involved spending up to some $24 million to stage the Olympics in the year 2000, and this does not include the $112 million that has already been spent on Homebush Bay.

I have to admit that I actually lived in Melbourne permanently at that time. The fascinating thing about that time brings me—having lived in Melbourne during its preparation for the games and during the games and the time after the games—to warn Sydney that it is going to be changed dramatically.

        The effect that that is going to have in the next seven years within the Sydney metropolitan area is going to be beyond all people's imagination. People are going to change.

        The interesting thing about the motion put forward by the honourable member for Reid is that he talked of all levels of government. Then he did what I thought was a very appropriate thing: he did not talk about that. He talked about the points in his motion, and he talked about the people performing various activities who are going be involved in it. I think that is the essence of an Olympic Games. Melbourne must teach us lessons and we in Sydney must listen to them. For all of its being a national campaign, and for of all its being a national event, the fact remains that it is Sydney that is putting it on. It is not Canberra, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth or Brisbane; it is Sydney. Of course, I have to say that being a Sydney member is a most exciting and satisfying occupation.

        I would caution the House with what has been suggested around the edge. I was disturbed, for example, to find that the state Labor Party had an advertisement in the paper about the Olympic Games a week or two ago. I have to say, in all honesty—and I gather that the few honourable members in the House at the moment realise that I am not given to petty political differences—that I have been a little alarmed at that advertising. I sincerely hope that we do not see in the next seven years an Olympic Games coming forward that is going to be burdened by political intrusion. We have to see that the major parties do not intrude. Support does not include intrusion in a games. I think what Melbourne showed was that, unless we have the whole community behind the games, they will not succeed.

I originally came from Queensland, but I was very pleased that I lived in Melbourne during the 1956 Olympic Games. I might take a minute or two to describe the fantastic difference that having the games made to that town. For example, in the main street of Melbourne, Collins Street, every major building—most of which have been removed and demolished since 1956—was just a garland of flowers and plants, something that had never happened before. I do not think it has happened since. But it happened during the Olympic Games.

For the first time we were having refugees coming to Australia by plane. It was something of which we had to be very conscious. It was something that Australia had not been conscious of before.

I think the first side of politics that tries to politicise the games is going to be the big loser. But I warn that we, as a nation, should not get carried away with what we call the definition of success. Success will involve both sides of politics getting the balance right; not depriving those sporting groups in the community who will not be providing Olympic gold medallists or, indeed, Olympic representatives, of funds so that we can chase gold medals in this Olympics.

                The success of the Sydney 2000 Olympics will not be measured by the number of gold medals that Australia wins. It certainly will not be measured by either side of politics privatising or selling off the Sydney showground, or flogging off the grounds of Lidcombe hospital to raise $50 million so that we can help fund the staging of the Olympics. We need to get the balance and the priorities right. I do not want to see health, education and other areas suffer at the expense of building white elephants. The way that we came together and actually won the bid, overcoming the politics of the IOC, is the measure of our professionalism. I am confident that, as a community with goodwill on all sides, we will get the balance right, and that as a nation we will benefit. Having obtained the Sydney 2000 Olympics, we will be able to focus on where we are going as a nation, and on how we see ourselves as part of the community of nations.

        —Mr Deputy Speaker, as a Victorian and as an Australian, I congratulate Sydney on achieving the Olympic Games in the year 2000. I think Sydney built on the experience of the Brisbane and Melbourne bids. I believe that experience was invaluable in the way Sydney put its bid before the International Olympic Committee. In the spirit of this motion, I join with the speakers before me in saying that as Australians, as Victorians, and as part of those who supported the Melbourne bid, we are delighted that Sydney has achieved the wonderful result of getting the games in the year 2000.

        Australia's involvement in the Olympic Games goes back to 1896, the first of the modern Olympic Games, when Teddy Flack won our first gold medal in the 800 metres event. In those days, of course, athletes were quite amateurish. They would not have trained in the way in which they train in this modern era.

        When I was a young boy I had the honour of attending a number of events at the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games. Unfortunately, John Landy did not win the 1500 metres running race. I particularly remember attending the rowing events held at Ballarat. They were exciting times in and around Melbourne. The Olympic Games only cost us $12 million to stage in those days—days of the Cold War—and a very friendly spirit was evident.

Already regarded as world champions in their event, they made it clear that Australia was pre-eminent in the world rowing scene.

I commend the attitude taken by the bid team, and I commend the IOC for seeing the merits of its case. It is only fitting that the primary concern is for the welfare of the athletes.

Economic dependence, family responsibilities, discriminatory practices in the workplace and in the professions, especially the denial of civil rights and full educational opportunities, have imposed restrictions on women.

        Breast cancer is a disease of epidemic proportions and the disparity in medical research funding needs to be addressed and solutions sought. The first step would be to at least accept that there is a problem in the lack of research funding. Professor John Forbes, a specialist in surgical oncology at the Newcastle University and Mater Hospital, says that a woman who dies of breast cancer has virtually cut her life by 20 years. As well, there is a one in 16 chance of a woman developing breast cancer compared with a one in 70 chance of developing cervical cancer.

        However, the anomaly arises where a woman who is younger than 40 years of age cannot acquire adequate screening because she is not covered under the Medicare rebate program, although for cervical cancer screening, with its lesser incidence of mortality, a rebate is available. This is an anomaly that does not sit well with me. Although the incidence of death from breast cancer amongst women under 40 is significantly less than amongst those over 40, it does not mean that a young Australian woman cannot contract the disease. Try telling an under 30-year-old woman that screening processes are denied to her because of her age and, because of her age, she will have to pay for them. This is an anomaly that we must seek a solution for and I strongly recommend to the government that it consider a solution that is equitable to Australian women.

        The acquired immune deficiency syndrome, AIDS, which has a substantially lower mortality rate than breast cancer, attracts $62 million annually in research assistance. Breast cancer kills six women a day, whilst AIDS has taken a total toll of 2,500 in the last 10 years. What is the level of Commonwealth funding for research into breast cancer, a disease with such a high mortality rate? In 1992-93, $17.5 million was spent on the national program for the early detection of breast cancer and in this financial year it is planned to spend $29.8 million.

        By comparison, the United States spends $400 million on research only. It is obvious that we fall very short of the requirements to develop a comprehensive research program. So what is the community doing about raising a higher level of awareness of this epidemic? In this particular place, it has been two years since we last spoke about breast cancer research. In fact, the parliamentary secretary at the table, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Mrs Crosio), was the person who was talking about it some two years ago.

It is our duty as leaders of the nation to seek solutions for this disparity in funding, but it should not be a challenge for government only. This is a community problem and can be solved by the community if the government were to support community funding as it did with the film industry. It may be recalled that the government supported investment in the film industry by allowing tax deductions on investment ranging up to 150 per cent. This had the effect of attracting funding to the industry and helping it develop to a position of respect within the wider community.

        It is my view that the government can consider a similar approach to solving the need for direct funding for research into breast cancer.

This would have the effect of attracting funds whilst reducing the pressure upon government for research funding. This funding idea is a way of attracting urgent funds, and I call upon the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) to consider this idea.

        Breast cancer, although mostly a woman's condition—I believe that six men died of breast cancer last year—affects all of the community. A one in 16 chance of women contracting it means that we all have a chance of being affected by it. It can affect our wives, it can affect our mothers, our grandmothers, our daughters, our sisters, our aunts, our cousins and our friends. It is not a condition that should be specifically a woman's worry and, if I can help to raise the consciousness of the need for increased expenditure into research, I will have contributed to the solution.

I agree with him that inadequate funds are available for research into breast cancer, and I applaud him for his recognition of the high proportion of women and families affected by this insidious disease. However, I cannot agree with his comparative approach to this issue.

        To compare total numbers of deaths and dollars spent on AIDS and breast cancer is not valid. It is more useful to consider the issue in the light of what is known already about the basic causes of both diseases, the potential success of research into causes, the nature of each disease, whether it is communicable, and its potential public impact. AIDS and breast cancer are totally different diseases. HIV-AIDS is a disease for which prevention is the only viable strategy available right now, while for breast cancer real shifts in mortality rates are being achieved through adequate treatment regimes, if the disease is picked up at an early stage.

        If I may be personal at this stage, I am one of many women in this country who have benefited from those early detection screening processes. It was not by mammography in that case, which I agree is demeaning and painful, and I hope we find something better, but by an ultrasound. This system is normally only used in pregnancies to check the state of a foetus but it can also be used in breast cancer detection. That was how the lump that I had was picked up, and I was able to go into hospital the next week and have this removed. That operation was extremely painful. I have screenings regularly and hopefully will not have another problem.

This is why the government in 1992-93 spent $14.9 million on breast cancer screening and has allocated $29.8 million in 1993-94.

This sum included about $900,000 in support of 12 projects for research specifically into breast cancer.

Further, cancer has been identified as one of the four priority areas of the revised national health goals and targets. A working group is presently exploring the best means to achieve and monitor a shift in incidence of cancer, with particular attention to breast cancer. In addition, in May 1993, as the honourable member for Cowan has already said, the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs commenced an inquiry into breast cancer screening and treatment.

        A direct consequence of the low level of government support for health and medical research is the high level of competition for funding through the National Health and Medical Research Council. In 1993 the project grant support success rate was at an all time low of about 21 per cent; that is, only one of five research projects were funded. In addition the real value of these grants has decreased. Costs have increased due to increases in salaries, costs of consumables and reagents and the decline in the exchange rate for the Australian dollar. At the same time the absolute value of a grant has remained relatively constant, or as happened last year actually decreased due to 2 per cent across-the-board cuts. Needless to say, there is little incentive to pursue a career in medical research in this country—which is not going to make it any easier to attract a critical mass of scientists to focus on any particular disease, including breast cancer.

Although those over 50 years of age are most at risk, significant numbers of younger women with families are affected.

        One obvious explanation for these increases is earlier detection. It is generally recognised that there has also been a greatly increased use of diagnostic mammography to investigate breast lumps and related concerns. Research into breast cancer has deepened our knowledge of the condition and is offering prospects for significant advances in the future. The cause of breast cancer is not known with precision, although it has been possible in more recent years to define who is at increased risk. This includes a family history and the presence of specific growth tissue abnormalities identified following surgical biopsy. Newer evidence has pointed to the specific genetic abnormalities that may be associated with higher than average risk. Current treatment of breast cancer involves removal of the affected tissue by total mastectomy or lumpectomy and radiotherapy, administration of hormones and/or chemotherapy to kill off residual microscopic amounts of cancer in the body.

        We are at a very exciting and important phase of our knowledge about this cancer, for the following reasons. Firstly, prevention seems possible using anti-oestrogens, for example, tamoxifen, and a large-scale trial is being proposed to test this. We know that tamoxifen halves the risk of a second breast cancer in women who have had one. Clinical geneticists and molecular biologists have identified significant abnormalities and a breast cancer gene in some relatives of breast cancer patients. Definition of who is at risk is therefore potentially precise and appropriate intervention should be considered, along with the ethical complexities that may arise. Research in this area is very important. The use of chemotherapy and hormone therapy after surgery has been shown to improve cure rates significantly. Clinical studies to precisely define who needs such treatment, and how much treatment, must continue. Clinical trials are expensive. Data collection is required over periods of many years, as the disease may run a prolonged course.

That should be the case whether they live in Woodridge in Queensland, the Blue Mountains in New South Wales, Fairfield in Sydney, Adelaide, Perth or wherever. All women are entitled to a choice of treatment. I suggest that that is not happening at the present time, and that is an issue of equity at which we must look.

While nobody would suggest that more money is not needed for research, as a community we must make decisions about funding priorities. For example, it costs the community $100,000 for a liver transplant, $58,000 to keep a premature baby alive, and $50,000 to treat an HIV sufferer from diagnosis to death. We can look at breast cancer in the same way. It has an horrendous effect upon the individual, and it has an horrific effect upon her family.

        Currently, the NHMRC is spending $13 1/2 million on medical research for all types of cancer. This will give us a better understanding of cancers. Included in this is breast cancer. The issue of priority has been raised and currently the government is looking at a commitment to medical researchers and an expansion of a further two per cent. But, as well as that, we have a commission to work by the minister, which is looking at ways in which research funding can be directed more effectively to areas of national priority.

        What we need to say is that our concern as a parliament, and our concern as a community, is very much about women's health, and is very much about the issue of breast cancer. The figures are horrific. We have seen that, if we focus on various campaigns, if we raise community awareness, if we ensure that people have a choice about prevention measures, and if people have a choice about treatment regimes equally across this country, we can address the issue.

        So the issue is one of choice for women. It is one of raising women's awareness and making sure that they have accessibility to screening measures and to other preventative measures to ensure that they are not subjected to massive mastectomies and so on, because by the time their cancer is revealed it is too large to treat.

        What we as a community have to ensure is certainly that there is adequate medical research. There is no question of that. But it is also a question about ensuring that we tap into that huge international research that we hear about. We also have to question the nature of some of the research that is done and how it is done. We acknowledge that the way in which some of the research is done overseas would not in fact be allowed to happen here and would not happen in the way that it does, particularly with the testing of some of the drugs. Tamoxifen has been cited. There are some other recognised side effects from that in terms of liver and endometrial cancer. Those kinds of issues all need to be addressed and they are all part of a total package about women's health.

       The north coast of New South Wales is one of the fastest growing regions in Australia. With a growth in population of 2.3 per cent per year, which is twice that of the urban sprawl of Sydney, the population on the north coast—which is now around 400,000—is expected to grow by as much as 80 per cent over the next 25 years.

        Physical infrastructure is, therefore, struggling to keep up with the population growth. This is evidenced by a number of sewage treatment plants which have nearly reached full capacity at this point in time.

        Regional development strategies on the north coast are essential. Due to the rapid growth in population, some parameters and guidelines for the area are needed. This is not just about pro-development, it is about controlled development. There have been far too many instances over the last few years of parties from both sides of the development fence getting away with more than they should. We have seen environmental impact statements used for political blackmail. We have seen small self-interest groups attract more attention than they deserve, simply because the media perceives their actions as being newsworthy.

        Regional strategies are, therefore, about providing guidelines for the future of such places as the north coast of New South Wales.

Unless such a system incorporates such aspects as introducing a more flexible workplace arrangement for regional Australia, then I do not think the system has much merit. The Office of Regional Development needs to look at the specific needs of different areas, and it must try to accommodate those specific interests.

        On the north coast of New South Wales, for example, small business is the key, with the average company having only six employees. Small business needs to be encouraged in such a way that it is able to develop and expand. In so doing, it will promote further growth and it will encourage more industry to relocate to the north coast. I have been in close contact with members of the business community within my electorate and they constantly make the comment that small business needs to be nurtured within the area for the area to continue to develop.

The minimum levels of attainment in turnover and/or salary levels are accordingly far too high for many quite worthy regional small businesses to qualify for assistance under government programs. This is just one simple example of the problem of having the Office of Regional Development run from Canberra where very little contact with the north coast, and regional Australia in general, is achieved.

        It is important that I put on record some statistics that show the condition of the north coast of New South Wales in comparison with the rest of Australia.

       If the Prime Minister would only look at the figures from the latest census, he would see that they clearly show the government to be screwing the north coast of everything that it has got. How can the north coast possibly become an autonomous region when petrol prices are going through the roof, aviation charges are going through the roof and transport and communications networks still leave a great deal to be desired? There have been many very worthwhile local initiative studies conducted by bodies such as the Manning Development Board, the Manning-Gloucester Business Enterprise Centre, the Mid-North Coast Development Board, the Hastings Business Enterprise Centre, and the Country Mayors Association of New South Wales.

        The Regional Development Task Force must realise the unique role the north coast of New South Wales plays. Businesses that employ six people or less are a feature of this area. As well, self-employment is a major factor in the economy of the north coast. It is, therefore, essential that the Regional Development Task Force realise this and, in particular, Mr Kelty, who, I imagine, may have a little trouble understanding self-employment. The priority that the task force must examine on the north coast is, therefore, its existing base of high self-employment and large numbers of small businesses.

It is my opinion that this area epitomises the problem that is faced by much of regional Australia where three tiers of government have the best intention, but where we get lots of rhetoric that is not backed up with action. Local government is frustrated because it identifies the many problems that exist, it perceives the solution, but it does not have the resources. State government traditionally does not place the needs of regional areas sufficiently high on its priority list to allow the pre-development of infrastructure to take place.

That has been the history of the place, and unfortunately it looks like it is going to continue to be the history of the place. Federal governments from both sides of politics have never considered that it has been their responsibility to allocate funds for regional development. As I have indicated, it is the initiative of this current government to look at regional development. We give funding for roads, we give funding for housing, we give funding for hospitals, we give funding for education, and we give it directly to the state government and it decides where it spends it. If the funding is not spent in the honourable member's area, he had better get his state members to lobby a bit harder.

        A classic example of how regional Australia suffers under the three tiers of government is clearly identified by the Nowendoc Road. Let us look at this because it is a case history. I am not apportioning any blame but what I am disgusted about is that we have a road that has had $10 million spent on it by the federal government. It was identified as a bicentennial project. It is an alternative link, a parallel route to the Pacific Highway and the New England Highway. About $10 million has been spent on it. There are about 20 kilometres of road that need to be completed. We have a road that, say, between Newcastle and Armidale would be 80 kilometres less in distance, an hour shorter through some of the best country which could be seen, and not only in Australia but anywhere in the world. It is one that the people of Gloucester had greatly anticipated. They pinned great hope on it, because it would increase the amount of traffic, and it would allow their businesses to develop.

        With another $5 million to be expended, what happened this year? The playing rules were changed. Tied grants that had identified money for this road ceased at the end of this year as a result of a request from Nick Greiner, and as an agreement with the former Prime Minister, Bob Hawke. It does not mean that the money was not allocated. The money was allocated. That money has been paid to the State government, and the Minister for Transport, Bruce Baird, in his decision, does not have that road ranked as high on his priorities as has the federal government. That money has not been allocated. We could say that $10 million has been wasted. There is a missing link in that road and I sincerely hope that we will see it corrected in our lifetime. But it does pose a very important question.

        Of course, that is a story that unfortunately is repeated throughout much of Australia. It is this sort of ad hoc decision making that does not support positive planning principles for regional development in our country. We have seen cuts in rail services to the north coast of New South Wales by a state government over the past six years that has not helped. Again, it is the case of economic rationalist policies triumphing over sensible planning policy.

        What we see in terms of regional development is that there is far too much duplication of effort from this government—including the proliferation of departments, who have all got their fingers in the pie—and what we really need is some degree of coordination. We are not getting that at all. So now we are having another go at looking at regional development, with this announcement of a study into business investment in regional areas. Where will it end? We have already got the Regional Development Task Force looking at it, but here is a separate inquiry coming on. Of course, it was only in the dying hours of the 1993 election campaign that the government did announce a department of regional development—a new found vision splendid, just on the eve of the election, just to try to get those few extra votes. And that is all the government needed, of course; it won by only 1,500 right around Australia. What we need is for this government to be really shamed into doing something on regional development, because so far there have been 10 years of rhetoric and no action at all.

        It is also true to say that this government has no commitment to the rural and farming communities of Australia.

Regrettably, unless we get something going with the economy to give our agricultural and rural and primary producers a fair go so that they can be competitive and so that they can make a quid and not be making a loss year after year, they will be a sunset industry.

There is such a decline that population is diminishing but the infrastructure is there. Unfortunately, the emphasis is on the capital cities, and that is why there will always be a role for the National Party, because we are the only party with a specific interest in regional and rural Australia. We are not dominated by Sydney, we are not dominated by Melbourne or Brisbane or Adelaide, and that is why the National Party will continue to serve the people of regional and rural Australia.

Since we are talking about constitutional change, let us go back to the original constitution.

We should not forget the possibility of the creation of new states. That great Labor man, Arthur Calwell, was one of the most outstanding advocates of new states, and he was right, as he was right about many things; he was right about migration at the time too.

Unemployment on the mid-north coast and the north coast of New South Wales is actually a growth industry because people, if they have to be unemployed, would much rather be in a climate where they have lower heating bills than they have here in Canberra or in Geelong or Griffith, where their clothing costs are less and the cost of food is less as well.

That area has simply got in and done it. That is in line with what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said just a few weeks ago, which those opposite criticised.

        Impediments are facing regional development on the north coast of New South Wales and, in particular, my electorate of Richmond. I do not want to be too parochial about it, but it is unique. On the mention of the word `parochialism', I do have to say some words. I do not want to lecture my colleagues on either side of the House—in particular, those on the other side—on the matter. But when we talk about regional development, we are talking about smaller and centred communities right throughout Australia. In that sense, there is a great deal of danger in that the arguments put forward do fall apart due to parochialism. It has happened on the north coast and the same sort of thing can happen across Australia with regional development, and the same thing happens within the cities.

That has happened. It is not something that we need to consider as being unique to country areas but it is something that we can address. I think we have to address it in a bipartisan way in the House.

The fact is that the local government areas seem to hold these up as a badge of office or badge of honour. As honourable members opposite know, they come back and ask us for assistance but, at the same time, they do nothing about population and growth rates. It is not so much controlling the population, as was alluded to by the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) but rather telling the people they cannot go here. We have to be prepared to face the local government areas and to say to them that growth rates of that size are unacceptable; that uncontrolled growth is unacceptable.

He told the entire north coast—the electorate and the constituents—that he had assurances from the then Minister for Roads, Mr Wal Murray, that the funding for the Pacific Highway would not be slashed at all: they would meet all their commitments and promises. Recently, what do we find? In the 1992-93 year, the funding for the Pacific Highway from the state government was underspent by some $41 million. That was an assurance coming from a parliamentary secretary; it virtually counted for nothing.

        Nevertheless, the north coast has proceeded. Through the good work of both the unions and the federal department, particularly DEET, we have been able to lead the way in areas such as jobskills. The north coast was one of the first areas to get cracking with jobskills with the cooperation of the unions. They were able to write and rewrite enterprise agreements to ensure that they got up and got going. The north coast leads the way in the numbers of jobskills positions that were put in place.

       Mr Deputy Speaker, I note that over the last 17 years the Australian Labor Party has been incapable of coming to a decision on the airport needs of Sydney. In the last 12 months it has moved tentatively to establish the third parallel runway at Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport. While that is a commendable decision, it took 17 years to reach it.

        The Fraser government struggled with Sydney's airport requirements for seven years and came to the conclusion in 1983 that a third parallel runway at Kingsford Smith was needed. But the election of the Hawke government put that to one side, and we saw honourable members whose electorates adjoined Kingsford Smith protesting against the decision for a third parallel runway. The honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), formerly the honourable member for Grayndler, and the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch) were most active in preventing the government making a decision to provide a third parallel runway.

        In 1989 Prime Minister Hawke made a joint statement with the then Minister for Transport and Communications, now the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis). I will read the first paragraph:

      <para font-size="-=2">
       On 22 March 1989 the government decided that they had to develop a third runway at Kingsford Smith Airport, subject to the satisfactory completion of the normal EIS processes and to begin the development of a second airport at Badgerys Creek.

       The fourth paragraph of the same press release said:

       The government will move now to acquire the remainder of the land needed for the development of Badgerys Creek. A general aviation facility will be constructed immediately as a first stage. In anticipation of the second stage, which will provide for both domestic and international services, detailed design work will commence immediately.
      </para>
      <para>
       So that decision was taken by the current government four years ago. The third parallel runway is on the go but things are moving very slowly at Badgerys Creek. I believe that there are good arguments why there should be immediate regenerated interest in Badgerys Creek, and that Badgerys Creek should in fact be the site of a second international airport for Sydney. In light of Sydney achieving the right to stage the Olympic Games, the arguments for moving immediately with that project are absolute and compelling. The government has allocated $50 million for some paltry work on a 1,800 metre runway to be built at Badgerys Creek—a runway that will provide for nobody really, and which will not relieve the congestion that confronts Mascot.

        In the same statement, the government said that the decision to build a third runway would not result in an increase in the number of people severely affected by aircraft noise but that it would in fact relieve aircraft noise around the Mascot area. That is one argument that has been overlooked by the opponents to the third runway at Kingsford Smith.

        In the notes attached to that 1989 statement, the Prime Minister said that the government would be commissioning a detailed design for a major airport at Badgerys Creek providing both domestic and international services. That means that both domestic and international services were contemplated back in 1989. However, today we find that, while $50 million has been allocated to the project, there has been a complete change in the government's attitude brought about by the Federal Airport Corporation, the FAC, which has decided that the only need Sydney has is for domestic and general aviation. Consequently, no provision has been made for international aviation at this second airport.

        How does the whole growth factor stack up in the period since 1989? What has happened? It was predicted on figures at that time that an airport at Badgerys Creek would be needed by approximately 2002 or 2003. However, since that time there has been a massive growth in aviation and travel in Australia, particularly in the international area. That prediction of 1989 is way out of date, and the FAC's own figures indicate that that program is now two or three years ahead and so the year 2002 or 2003 becomes the year 2000. The increase in aviation in the past four years—and the international travel agencies say that the growth in aviation will continue until the turn of the century—means that we will have a need for a second airport, not as originally predicted in the year 2002 or 2003 but by the year 2000.

        I have figures from the New South Wales government, which commissioned an inquiry. That inquiry indicates that approximately 1.3 million additional overseas travellers can be expected into Sydney during the year 2000, so that year becomes a critical one for international travel in the Sydney area. The FAC originally predicted 16.5 million passengers by the year 2000, but it now seems that the figure will be something like 20 million passengers by the year 2000. History has indicated that the year 2002 forecast was actually five years out.

That allows the FAC to have an easy time with its management, it has a sure revenue base and, primarily, it does not have to compete with anybody.

        My colleague the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) has established that there is plenty of international interest in the construction and operation of an airport for Sydney. The FAC should confront this competition. It has refused in fact to meet passenger demand. Its figures demonstrate that. It does not want competition operating in a modern passenger conscious society. It is full of reasons why the whole thing should not and cannot happen. It keeps changing the dates by which the international airport will be needed. It wants to revel in its monopoly power; it wants to defy the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works and its recommendations; it has neglected the Olympics completely. Like Telecom or like Kerry Packer, it wants to retain monopoly interest in its set areas and the consumers of Australia be blowed. I believe that it is time that the minister and the government changed their minds.

It will not be a proper passenger airport or proper freight airport. It will not have the capacity or the facility to be anything but a gigantic and very expensive white elephant.

This would necessitate the construction of a 2,900-metre runway and the related work.

After spending millions of taxpayers' dollars, these consultants will tell us that to fully compete in Asia we must make the best use of our airspace and to achieve that or to achieve our full potential—this should have been some 20 years earlier—we should have constructed an international freight airport that could also have taken charters.

        In the last federal election, the opposition parties had, as part of their policy, the immediate development of Badgerys Creek as an international airport facility. We had spent some years examining the needs of Sydney airport and the future growth, and we also spent some years examining how this would be financed. There is no doubt that it is almost impossible for governments today to come up with the sort of money that will be required to build that full international structure.

        Overseas at the moment the development of new airports is being left to major international consortia, and there are some very good examples of it. Istanbul, for example, has a new airport facility that was developed by private consortia. There are new airports in Alaska that have been developed by private consortia. I spent some time speaking to a few organisations that I thought would be interested in the development of Badgerys Creek. The interesting thing was that they were and that they had already done a great deal of homework on the development of Badgerys Creek, without, I suppose, too many people in Australia knowing.

        My suggestion to government would be that, as a first step, it should advertise as soon as possible for expressions of interest in the development of Badgerys Creek to full international standard, to just see what comes out of the woodwork. The government would be absolutely amazed at the reaction that it would get, because there is a realisation that Australia is becoming a major growth destination in the Asia-Pacific region. As I have quoted in this House before, even on pure tourism terms, if 140 million Asians are going to travel offshore by the year 2000 for their holidays and we get one per cent of that business, we cannot handle it.

        The reality is that 62 per cent of the business is going to come through Sydney. The reality is that, even with the third runway, Sydney airport is going to be very tight by 1998-99. There are problems with the future development of terminal facilities in Sydney, and I think there is a realisation throughout the aviation community that we do need the third runway but, most importantly, we need the development of Badgerys Creek at the same time if we are going to be able to pick up those pressures.

        It is true that a lot of infrastructure would have to be provided for Badgerys Creek airport. Prior to the election, the opposition gave a commitment that it was prepared to put the money up—I think the figure was some $50 million, initially—with the New South Wales government to look at those infrastructural requirements. We are going to need high-speed rail links. We are going to need some massive roadworks put in place. But that will be the area where government can become involved at both a state and federal level. We will not be spending a cent if we go to the private arrangement on Badgerys Creek, in terms of the construction of that airport, and there will be an opportunity for us to help, for the state, local and federal governments to get in there to make sure that the infrastructure is right.

If we are going to have true development of international tourism, we are going to need a facility other than the Kingsford Smith arrangement, and that will become even more imperative as we get closer to the holding of the Olympic Games.

        As my colleagues and I on this side of the House foretold in the development programs of Sydney airport and the third runway, what we have to come to terms with now is the fact that, when it was decided to build the third runway, the Federal Airports Corporation put all its eggs in one basket. The fact that millions of dollars have been invested in the third runway and the associated infrastructure of the airport has meant that the FAC does not have the money to build another airport around Sydney in the foreseeable future.

        Not only does the FAC not have the money, but it does not want to build it. Some 50 per cent of the revenue for all the public airports in Australia operated by the FAC comes from Sydney airport. Congestion at Sydney airport is money in the till for the FAC. It is not the least bit interested in seeing an airport built that will take away the great cash cow that is Sydney airport.

        A third runway at Kingsford Smith airport will ease congestion at that airport, and will extend the life of it for passengers.

That is a very high trigger for a second airport to be built and to be operating. If we are going to have it built by 1996, the time to be starting it is now, because it will take at least three years. If we are going to build one, we do not want the 1,800-metre strip the FAC is proposing. We need a 2,900-metre strip in 1996, and not by the year 2015 as the FAC is proposing.

But I believe that considerable investment in the airport would lead to jobs and would facilitate better urban planning in the general south-western Sydney region. This would mean that the urban sprawl that we are already getting—courtesy of the New South Wales government—without proper infrastructure and community facilities, would be able to be much better planned, and a real community could be built out there.

         —Out of sight, out of mind: that is how this government seems to treat Western Australia when there is not an election in the wind. With the government's self-interest focusing its attention on New South Wales, it is hardly surprising that even now there are occasional rumblings and mutterings from secessionists in the west. But what is surprising, given the government's focus on the most populous state, is that it is happy to ignore what was once a very important part of New South Wales. I am talking about Albany, in my electorate of Forrest. Captain George Vancouver claimed the western part of the continent when he explored the Albany area in 1791. In 1826, Major Edmund Lockyer occupied the area on behalf of the colony of New South Wales, so Albany became not only the first settlement in the continent's west but also the westernmost town in New South Wales. Albany, in strategic terms, was a very important part of the young colony of New South Wales.

         It was very important, because, as with much of Australia's settlement by the British, the settlement of Albany was a case of beating the French to it. Let me explain to honourable members what this means. At present, we have six states and two territories making up a single and generally harmonious Commonwealth, united under one flag and one language. If France had claimed part of Australia, instead of those states and territories now debating things such as uniform schooling and land management, we would have a divided continent with different flags, a different system of government and a different official language. Just imagine the sorts of problems the federal government would be having with the French farmers in the GATT round if they were literally in the same continent.

         That example may seem far-fetched, but I use it to illustrate the historical national importance of Albany. But Albany has a lot more history than just being the place the British beat the French to. It is a picturesque town on the Princess Royal Harbour, part of the magnificent King George Sound. It has a rich hinterland, and during the last century was Western Australia's most important port. Control of the settlement was transferred from New South Wales to the newly established Swan River colony in March 1831. In the same year, Albany became a free settlement and the town was planned and laid out for development into a prosperous, solid, stable community. Reflecting that intended permanence, Albany has many fine historic buildings. Many of these buildings were constructed of stone by local craftsmen, helped by convict labour. These same buildings give Albany a great deal of character and are a constant reminder of the town's rich history.

         If fate and politics had not played a hand, Albany might today have been one of Australia's largest and most important cities. In fact, Major Lockyer, who settled Albany, favoured developing the town as the capital of the west. Another claim to historical fame is that Albany was the site of the very first dawn service for the Anzacs. This was held by local rector, Reverend White, on Mount Clarence, to honour and give heart to the first Australian and New Zealand contingents heading off to World War I from their assembly point at King George Sound. Albany became a vital staging port for the Anzac troop carriers during the First World War and that first service set a tradition that is still honoured today. However, the advent of large steamships and the decision at the turn of the century to establish Fremantle as the major steamer port in Western Australia created a trading slump for Albany.

         The town pulled itself back to prosperity with the lucrative whaling industry, and was the site of the last shore based whaling enterprise in the southern hemisphere until its closure in 1978. More recently, an equally promising tuna industry has been ruined by the federal government's inept handling of tuna quotas, and now the federal government is threatening to snuff out the area's fledgling wine industry with a 55 per cent increase in the sales tax on wine.

         I earlier complained about this government's out of sight, out of mind attitude towards the west. The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) is responsible for the national heritage. As such, she surely has a responsibility to Albany to help the town preserve and recapture the charm of its past. Much has been done by the people of Albany but a great deal more needs to be done to restore not only a significant part of the history of Western Australia but also a very important part of the history of New South Wales.

         The minister must realise that her responsibility for national heritage means that she should at least give Albany the same kind of consideration governments of the past gave to Port Arthur. As yet, though, I have been disappointed in the minister's response to Albany. As the federal member, I wrote to the minister in 1990 pointing out Albany's case for the kind of consideration which had been given to Port Arthur. The historical Tasmanian town had, in the seven years to 1986, received state and federal funding of $9 million for a major conservation and development project to restore its convict history and secure its place on the nation's tourism itineraries.

         I told the minister that I was keen to see a similar program to preserve and to restore one of Australia's most historic towns, Albany. A great deal of conservation and restoration already had been done in Albany. For example, in 1983 the town had begun overseeing the restoration of the Princess Royal Fortress, a defence establishment dating back to 1893. The town needed a heritage register, listing buildings of historical significance which needed restoration, so that a list of funding priorities could be established.

         I pointed out that the most appropriate means of funding would involve state, federal and local government grants, backed by community support. Indeed, I advised the minister that a Commonwealth contribution of two dollars for every dollar raised locally, similar to Port Arthur's funding process, would encourage considerable local support. I asked the minister to evaluate this proposal with a view to formal application for funding in 1991-92. I also suggested that she visit Albany so that she could see for herself, first-hand, how important it was for the town's history to be preserved. In reply, the minister was quick to point out that the Port Arthur project was a one-off and that there would be no similar funding for Albany. Still, the town decided to go ahead without the minister's support and in 1991 applied for grants under the National Estate grants program. All three grant applications were rejected.

         The year 1991 also was the bicentenary of Vancouver's exploration of the Albany area. Again I wrote to the minister, inviting her to take part in the celebrations. Again the response was negative. A third letter to the minister brought a slightly different response. In July 1991, I was told I would be contacted when a suitable opportunity arose for the minister to visit Albany. It is now October 1993 and I am still waiting for that opportunity to arise. The minister is apparently more occupied with preselection matters and Olympic trips. In the words of a letter I received from the Albany shire in 1991:

        I might add that the celebrations I mentioned were a tremendous success, despite the official lack of interest. Albany swallowed its disappointment and continued to go it alone, restoring the town hall, the forts, the old gaol and the historic precincts of Stirling Terrace and York Street, with the help of small grants, local government and community involvement. The old hospital is now the Vancouver Arts Centre, while one of the town's earliest buildings, the Patrick Taylor cottage, has been converted into a local museum.

         If the minister undertook to give Albany the kind of special consideration it deserves, the spin-offs to the town would be enormous. Albany has great potential, with its combination of a rich history and natural beauty, to develop a significant tourism industry. Albany really is a special place. Its natural scenery and splendid heritage make it a town which should be right on the top of the list of people that draw up the tourism itineraries around Australia.

The people of Albany have achieved much, but without the Commonwealth government playing its part, I fear the tremendous tourism opportunities of this town may be lost.

         —In a speech that I made in May of this year in this place I outlined my concerns about a political campaign that had been run during the March federal election campaign by the organisation called the Housing Industry Association, better known as the HIA. In that speech I outlined the way in which an organisation which is supposed to be an objective independent industry association conducted a very strong party political campaign against certain candidates for the Labor Party in certain seats around this country—I being one of them in my electorate of Moreton.

         Soon after that I was accused by the executive director of the HIA, Dr Silberberg, of engaging in a political vendetta. He said that I was seeking to punish him and his organisation because they dared to take a contrary position to that of the government. In fact, that was not my position. I was, in fact, making the point in that speech that the HIA misused its members' money in conducting that campaign and that it had alleged to its members that it would be a non-party political campaign. It said it would be based purely on arguing about a piece of legislation, yet at the time of the election in March it engaged in a very strong political campaign in which it gave endorsement to conservative candidates and opposed Labor candidates in various seats.

         Since the time of that speech when I outlined my concerns about the operations of the HIA, I have received an enormous amount of information from organisations representing thousands of house owners who have suffered grievously at the hands of the HIA and organisations or building companies that are members of the HIA. In fact, my file since May would be over six inches thick with submissions and letters and complaints that I have received from people all around this country who have suffered because of problems of corruption, extortion and unfair practices in the building industry that have been perpetrated by builders and building companies.

         The reason I wish to speak today is to outline some of the concerns of those organisations and to highlight the fact that there is a continuing exposure of problems with the Housing Industry Association. I think it is very important that the government take note of these problems and respond with some positive action to deal with some of the matters that I am about to raise.

         In all of the very thick swag of complaints I have received there is a whole host of disparate issues that have emerged. A lot of them are not the responsibility of the federal parliament and I acknowledge that. They are, in fact, the responsibility of state governments and state instrumentalities that have the responsibility of supervising the housing industry. But what they do is add up to a picture of very great concern about the way in which the Housing Industry Association operates and the way in which some of its members, companies and directors have conducted their affairs.

         It also highlights the fact that there are some real problems with the way in which representatives of the Housing Industry Association—all its members are companies which are in the building industry for private profit—are also on a number of government instrumentalities which are supposed to supervise the building industry and are supposed to be there to protect consumer interests. There are, within the Housing Industry Association, members who are trying to wear two or three different hats and who are supposed to be providing objective advice to governments about housing industry matters, yet they are involved in personal gain in the housing industry, because they run building companies, and they are not able, I think, to divorce their personal interests as far as their companies are concerned from the more objective role that they are supposed to have in giving advice and protecting consumer interests. I think that is a very real concern that we should all have.

         One of the organisations that have written to me is a group called the Victims of Builders Support Group Inc., a group incorporated in Victoria. One of the members of that group has written to me outlining that group's concerns about the HIA and forwarding to me a copy of a submission that it is making to an inquiry that the Victorian Minister for Fair Trading, the Hon. Jan Wade, is conducting into the building industry in Victoria. It is horrendous to read about the problems occurring in the home building industry, about how thousands of ordinary families, ordinary people, have suffered grievously at the hands of some building companies and, in particular, about how they have suffered because of the operations and policies of the Housing Industry Association.

         I make that claim for one very clear reason: for construction of houses the member companies of the Housing Industry Association adopt the contract that the HIA recommends. The building contract between the building company and the family or the consumer seeking to build the home has been drawn up by the HIA. It is that contract that is the cause of so many problems in all the states. I realise that we have different organisational structures in each state, but this contact causes similar problems around the country.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The major problem with this contract is that it is very biased in its provisions. Most people do not have legal experience to understand what a contract means. That is why I stress the great importance of any person who is about to sign a contract with a builder getting independent legal advice about the terms and conditions of that contract. The HIA recommended contract is very biased in favour of the builder. It enables builders to be paid for work that they do not do. The clauses in this contract are so biased in favour of the builder that the consumer has very little redress. There is very little sanction against the builders for their failure to comply with the contract, but there are lots of sanctions against home owners or consumers if they fail to comply.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In Victoria the problem that the Victims of Builders Support Group Inc. has is that the contract refers any disputes between the home owner and the building company to compulsory arbitration. That in itself is not a bad idea, except that the arbitration system is dominated by the very building companies that are the subject of complaint. The HIA is represented in that arbitration process, so consumers are not getting an independent, objective arbitration. The people who are supposed to be doing that independent arbitration are in fact closely linked with the building industry.

       <para first-indent="16">

         That is a problem we have throughout the country. A lot of the organisations that have been set up by state governments allegedly to be independent and to protect the interests of consumers are in fact dominated by representatives of the building industry and the HIA.

         We also have problems with the way in which some of the member companies of the HIA have operated on boards and with the fact that there is a cross-fertilisation of directorships between individual member companies of the HIA and the HIA's own organisations and companies. There is a concern about the failure to separate interests of the separate companies. Allegations are being made to me, and information is being sent to me, that public moneys that have been provided to companies to undertake work on behalf of governments in researching housing industry issues have in fact been diverted into private profit by certain members. That is a serious allegation which I believe needs to be examined.

Small business is not insignificant within Australia but, after a very debilitating budget for that sector, it appears that all the government is prepared to do is to run around the countryside giving small business awards.

Of these businesses, 273,000 employ fewer than 10 people and 39,000 employ between 10 and 49 people. In the two years February 1991 to February 1993 medium and large businesses shed 275,000 jobs while small businesses added about 135,000 jobs. In other words, small business is a very significant contributor to employment in the recession we had to have.

I want to grieve in particular about the effect that regulation has upon these businesses and draw the parliament's attention to a recent survey conducted by the ABS. In a case study of some 224 individual companies it was found that a high percentage of respondents felt that the government forms were `very difficult to complete'. Nearly 50 per cent of those interviewed felt that the volume of paperwork had risen over the past three years. More than half of those regarded the increase as significant. The Australian Taxation Office was the worst culprit, according to business. Forms relating to fringe benefits tax, sales tax, company tax and payroll tax were considered to be the most common types of forms and often the most difficult to complete.

One can never recognise the boss in most small businesses. He looks very much like the employees. But he has to go off to the Industrial Relations Commission just to compete with the big guys. Today small business grocers and small business delicatessens are in desperate competition with Coles, Woolworths and the big supermarkets. The big companies have their industrial officers to go into the Industrial Relations Commission to do deals and stitch everything up. How does the guy behind his delicatessen counter get his apron off and go off to the commission so that he can get the same competitive advantage through the commission as the big guys will get? The government is legislating for big unions and for big business. It is absolute farce for the Minister for Science and Small Business (Senator Schacht) to be running around the countryside giving out small business awards. These people want a bit of fairness. They certainly do not want a deal that prevents them from making wage arrangements that are similar to those made by their big-time competitors who have all the advantages that are quite obvious to everyone.

It is small business, which lacks the capital to do that, which will create employment. I have never seen any worse approach than this industrial relations deal fixing up the ACTU bureaucracy and killing the opportunity for small business to compete.

         Explicitly because of government policy money is being built up for the purposes of not only a higher retirement income for workers but also an improvement in the nation's savings. We have a compulsory scheme underwritten by a superannuation guarantee charge that drives money into superannuation funds to be invested on behalf of workers. That money will be made available for Australia's investment for the long haul and will also be made available for workers in retirement, giving them a higher income in retirement than would otherwise have been the case.

There are a couple of reasons for this increase: firstly, a rising share market; and, secondly, contributions being made to superannuation funds prior to the end of the financial year to take advantage of the higher tax deduction and to satisfy superannuation guarantee charge obligations. I think the next release of figures will show an even bigger increase, taking into account the fact that the final date for payment of the SGC will fall in the September quarter.

         We need to compare those figures with those of just a decade ago. Ten years ago superannuation assets stood at just $32.6 billion. The figure for the June quarter in 1992 was $154 billion. In other words, over the 1992-93 financial year contributions to, and earnings of, superannuation funds totalled just over $15 billion, or an increase of almost 10 per cent. After 30 June 1994, when contributions under the SGC are to be made quarterly, we will begin to see a regular and rising injection of money into superannuation funds that will be both a boost to retirement benefits of workers and a fillip for national savings.

         This is money that, in most cases, would not have been put away but for government policy, and I stress that. We did not leave it to the free will of the individual whether or not money would be put away for retirement incomes. We have had an enormous shift in culture on the question of retirement incomes in this country in the last few years. Workers had expected that, regardless of what they did about their retirement income, when they came to retire they would pick up a government pension. For all the reasons we have heard a million times, we cannot expect the generosity of a government pension 20 years hence when the numbers of retirees relying on the taxes of the then workers will be so great that we may not be able to satisfy everyone.

         It has taken an enormous shift of policy and it will continue to take an enormous shift in the culture of the savings of Australians to ensure that today's taxpayers put away some money for their own retirement. There are two mechanisms that we use in order to ensure that. We give a tax benefit for money being put away in superannuation and we also compulsorily force employers to put away a percentage of earnings on behalf of workers and that percentage is going to rise from three or five per cent at the moment right through to nine per cent. At some point in the future, as yet unspecified, we will be asking employees also to make a contribution.

         Employees would argue, if honourable members were to ask them right now, that they have, in fact, made the initial contributions. They may be right. It is not a debate we need to hold. We do not need to have people fix on the minute detail of the sorts of changes that we have been writing as a government. This is very essential detail about the prudential protection of superannuation funds. Those sorts of rules will have an effect on funds but most workers will never get to look at the detail, nor do they need to. What they want to know is: are my funds earning well; will the money be there at the end of the day when I retire? For all intents and purposes, the government cannot back these funds, but we can give the best regulatory regime available to ensure that the funds are not misused, mismanaged, poorly invested, and so on. By the release of these figures, showing a terrific increase in the assets of super funds and ADFs, I want to get people's minds fixed on the nest egg itself. The nest egg is growing; it is growing well; it is well and intelligently invested. What is more, workers will get to know more about the assets of their own fund. They will get to follow the business of their own fund. This is a big shift.

         Up until three or four years ago, most workers, of course, had little concern for those sorts of matters. They expected, as a right—and that was fair enough—to get a pension at the end of the day. They were not really aware how money was put away on their behalf for those pensions. Of course, the money was not so much put away on their behalf but drawn from current taxpayers to pay for those pensions, and that cannot go on indefinitely.

         This nest egg is being built up and being managed by the private sector so that we have a unique arrangement in this country whereby we have a government mandated means of pouring money into superannuation funds but a private means of management. This is very well fenced, I might say, by government regulations as to how those funds will be managed. Between the two of us—the private sector and the government sector—we think we have an excellent scheme that will ensure many more funds are contributed to savings in Australia than would otherwise have been the case.

         Of course, I do want to point out to honourable members that the figure of the assets of super funds and ADFs is not the same as the savings of the nation. I am not pretending to say that. Savings is a much broader question. For instance, governments can contribute to the nation's savings by marking back the amount of expenditure they have by not running such large deficits. As the Treasurer has mentioned many, many times, we have—if it does not get wrecked by the opposition in the Senate—a budget strategy that will lower the government's call on the nation's savings by lowering the government's deficit over the next three or four years. But over and above those other contributors to savings, the primary one here that will affect and will be of greatest interest to Australian workers is superannuation funds.

I want to compliment the government on the system that it has established for superannuation funds and I am very pleased to be able to reveal these figures today about Australia's growing list there.

Anyone with such knowledge would have been more than a little confused by the latest foray of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) into military history, GATT and free trade in his now famous victory speech at Villers-Bretonneux.

I never thought to tell my history students that those who fought in the trenches were really defending the French in the knowledge that, 80 years later, their sacrifice would be a key bargaining chip in Australia's push for a pure international free trade regime.

I suppose that is the beauty of the Prime Minister. He has a penchant for keeping you guessing.

         Unlike the Prime Minister, the left of Australian politics has been quite consistent in saying that this was a war which was none of our business. The truth is, contrary to the myth trotted out by the Prime Minister in France, Australian soldiers on the Somme and elsewhere in Europe thought they were defending the once mighty empire, not the French. Why the Prime Minister did not stick to the script and cite the wanton loss of life that comes from tagging along with an imperial power to defend the republic leaves those who support the republic somewhat disappointed.

He listed them as follows: myth No. 1—Australia's adoption of free trade will encourage other nations to follow suit. We hardly need to argue about that one. Myth No. 2—Australia is highly protectionist. When you cast your eye over the various forms of protection used by other countries, you quickly discover it is not true. Myth No. 3—free trade reduces prices in Australia. There is no evidence that this is true. In any case, cheaper goods are not much use to you if you do not have a job. Myth No. 4—free trade forces Australian producers to become more efficient. This of course is the great catchcry around the parliament. Sometimes, no matter how efficient you are, you just cannot compete with goods produced under conditions we would not accept in Australia. Our dumping laws pay no attention to these anomalies. International competitiveness in an Olympic sprint bears no resemblance to the production of goods. Why do you think performance enhancement drugs are prohibited?

We have made important progress in Europe through a range of measures. We now have a situation where the Uruguay Round is, I believe, close to a solution and there are positive outcomes evident.

         —When members of parliament have just been to an election and been defeated as a party on policies which they believe are right for the country, and they believe they have been defeated by falsehoods and propaganda spread by the winning party, they tend to be a little bit disillusioned. They face a dilemma. They think to themselves, `Well, there is a saying that people get the government they deserve', and they think, `Well, perhaps we really should not oppose any of the measures that are brought in by governments because that is what the people wanted and that is what they are going to get'. But, having seen what has happened in Western Australia under Labor and in South Australia under Labor and in Victoria under Labor, I adopt the attitude that we really should as members of parliament try and do all we can to assist those people we are elected to represent. I might say that my electorate, fortunately, would not accept all the nonsense that was being put to them by the Labor Party at that time.

         One of the things the coalition did before the last federal election was promise the people that we would take the excise off fuel, 26c per litre for business and 19c for private users. The reason we were putting this forward was that we realise what a tremendous burden this excise places on most people in Australia. Whether we are talking about the average family person in their day-to-day activities, whether we are talking about the mining industry, manufacturing or transport, all of these things are affected by the price of fuel.

         I remember going into a business house just before the election when I was campaigning and speaking to a gentleman there. I tried to explain to him what we were going to do about the fuel excise, and he calculated that it would save his company—it was only a small retail business and had a small trucking operation—about $12,000 per annum. Because it was a business, he would actually have had more costs taken off. That was the difference between his surviving and not surviving as a business in these recessionary days. So it did mean a great deal to him.

I could just imagine that after the 17 August budget when he was eating his fish and chips he would just about have choked when he found out what the government has perpetrated in the area of fuel excise.

         Recent studies show that the Australian trucking industry is really very efficient. There is no doubt about that, and that is despite our tax regime where in Australia we are taxed about 27c per kilometre compared to 10c per kilometre in the United States. Despite that tax we are competitive, but since the budget that no longer applies, and I would say there would now be an even greater burden on our transport industry.

         The transport industry or trucking industry carries about 74 per cent of Australia's 1.33 billion tonnes of freight. It is a very flexible industry and has managed to compete despite government. The recession has cut profits to the bone. Some trucking companies may have been fortunate to earn about five per cent on their money, and now they estimate that this impost will cost the trucking industry $175 million per annum, and add $2,500 to the cost of a truck. It will cause freight cost increases, it will do something about the environment—it will have a bad effect on the environment—and it will have an impact on safety, on employment and, of course, through the social impacts.

         I heard the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) speaking about our competitiveness in world markets and the need to export. If we want to remain internationally competitive, we should have the cheapest, not the dearest, forms of transport in a country that really does have a tyranny of distance. We have to be lean and mean and we have to be better than other nations. If you look at the latest tax comparisons based on pre-budget taxes and charges in cents per kilometre, short haul in Australia costs 17c, in the United States 4c, and in Canada 12c. For long haul it is 27c compared to 10c in the United States and 17c in Canada, and these are comparable countries, of course. That has a dramatic effect, particularly in the rural areas, where we are trying to add value to our primary industry products and make them cheaper to export.

         The government has recently set up a regional task force headed by Mr Kelty. That task force will be travelling around the regional areas investigating how those areas can best improve their manufacturing and production in order to create employment.

         For example, in Europe the cost of diesel is half the cost of petrol. People there understand that the trucking industry is very important. They understand how important it is to get produce from one place to another. I have been talking about regional and rural areas, but in this country we have also increased the cost of fares for people in the cities where many people have to commute to work. This excise is going to have a dramatic effect on those people as well. People will already be paying $2 to $3 more for a basket of grocery goods. So the tax relief that the government is talking about is an absolute nonsense. It will be absorbed by the fuel excise cost, without any other taxes that may be imposed.

         I understand that some deal is going to be done with the mining companies. If a deal is not done on these fuel imposts, some of these mining companies, particularly those in isolated areas, will have to close up business. In fact, it has been rumoured that some of these businesses may be seeking approval from the government to set up nuclear energy plants so that they can at least compete with countries overseas. The oil tax affects Nabalco's bauxite and aluminium plant at Gove in the Northern Territory and at Savage River in Tasmania and a host of others which are going to find it extremely difficult to be competitive with these added costs.

I say to the Australian people that it is very important that they do not take notice of all the newspapers, and things they read, because we have a lot of sycophants in the media. People should get hold of some constructive literature, whether or not it is talking about the Mabo debate, the republic or fuel excise and taxes, and really study it.

         Regional development is about developing the nation on a regional basis. It is about cooperation between federal, state and local government and it is about cooperation between government departments. It is about the community working together—government, industry, unions and local communities. This was Tom Uren's dream; a dream he was achieving during his time as Minister for Urban and Regional Development. Sadly he was not to realise his dream at that time. Unfortunately, Malcolm Fraser put regional development into the too-hard basket. It is hard. The type of cooperation and coordination which this process will entail, the process put in place by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development will be hard work and will require goodwill at all levels.

         —The Keating government must act on unemployment in the regional area of Bendigo. No more committees are required; what is required now is action on unemployment. The ABS figures on unemployment for September paint a very graphic picture of the situation in my electorate. In the past 12 months unemployment in the Bendigo region has grown by over 10 per cent, and just in the last months the unemployment figures have gone up by a further two per cent in that region. So far, all the Keating government has done is to establish a further committee to look at unemployment and prepare a white paper for discussion, and that will not take place until early next year. So the government is putting it off. After almost 11 years in government, it has deferred any action at all on unemployment in regional areas.

So it is setting up committee after committee after committee. It did not expect to be elected at the last election and it has no plans in place.

That day demonstrated to me just what public opinion of this place and the people in it must be. No wonder they have so very little faith in their elected representatives.

I came to the realisation of just how much discussion occurs in this place in question time, especially if people are in opposition. Watching and learning from senior politicians of all ilks who have gained this superior knowledge has given me an insight into the great skill and dexterity they have acquired—for putting points of order, moving ridiculous amendments and participating in a discussion in a supposedly orderly fashion.

         —I want to bring before the parliament an issue that is a national disgrace. Mr Speaker, are you aware that vital marine life saving equipment is still subject to sales tax? Life jackets, emergency location beacons, marine radios, direction finders, life harnesses, life rafts and, possibly most important of all, flares are all subject to sales tax. Organisations like the Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol not only pay dearly as they equip their own lifeboats but they have their job made harder as they try to educate the general boating public on the need to carry this safety gear. The Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol has cast a safety net around much of the Australian coastline. It is recognised as our premier marine research and rescue body. It saves lives. It recovers more than a million dollars worth of boats and equipment every year. It augments the various state water police efforts. It is an official emergency service, yet all of its equipment, even its fuel, is taxed and the Commonwealth government gives it nothing in return.

         I implore the government to repeal this immoral tax and give due credit to one of Australia's most honoured voluntary services. I say to the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) that I will swap him a dollar for a life any day. The Fightback proposal allowed voluntary organisations to be free of these charges, and I think it is time the government was consistent in its taxing policies in regard to wholesale sales tax and its fuel taxes.

         Port Adelaide is becoming more important as a gateway for overseas trade. An indicator of that is the 36 per cent increase in the number of vessels which used the Adelaide container terminal last year. In 1991-92, some 91 ships used the terminal while last financial year the number was 141. The major gains have mainly come from improved services and levels of trade through Port Adelaide with Japan, Korea, South-East Asia and New Zealand.

         —I draw the attention of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the government to the effect that they are having on the older generation of Australians. This group is in a state of future shock engendered by the rapidity of change, the selling off of national assets and institutions, the rising foreign debt and unemployment. The endless changes to superannuation, the collapse of retirees' incomes through reduced interest rates, the removal of many thousands of people from access to part pensions, the counting of unrealised capital gain as income for only one section of the community, the attack on long service leave, the penalising of owners of older cars, and the raising of the pension age for women are all seen as bewildering blows. The reactions range from fury and disbelief to a feeling that it is all unfair and undeserved.

         But all these changes pale into insignificance alongside the shock of what is perceived by older Australians as a concerted attack on their values. The endless rubbishing of the 1950s, the behaviour and language of the Prime Minister, the divisive and abusive public debates on the flag, the republic, Mabo, the constant claim that Australians have no national identity, and the transformation of multiculturalism into racism are all issues that are irrevocably alienating the 4.3 million Australians over the age of 50. Irrespective of the merits of these issues, the brutalising of people's values is unacceptable in a liberal democracy.

That view can also be extended to government assets being sold. In my submission to the House, the option should be that we should be leasing those assets and they should revert back to the Commonwealth at a later date. That will provide certainty for business, if we give long-term leases, and we do not lose government assets. Let us not sell off the family jewels, let us look at leasing them and getting them back.

We can replace the fibreglass and we can replace all the seagrass and all the other products with real 100 per cent Australian wool. Some testing has indicated that wool has a higher insulation value than the man-made product. So I would encourage the Olympic committee to make sure that we put wool in all the buildings that will house the athletes for the games and that we use them to advertise throughout the world what Australia is doing with its wool stockpile for the good of the nation, for the good of our farmers and for the good of the economy.

First, the current account trend is better despite a rise in the seasonally adjusted deficit. Second, job vacancies are rising. Third, higher demand is boosting takings for tourism establishments. Fourth, there is a tentative resumption of growth in home building approvals. The fifth reference was on slow retail growth, or, to use the words of the ABS, growth `at a snail's pace'. Those points—the current account, job vacancies, higher demand boosting takings in tourist establishments, and a tentative resumption of growth for home building approvals—all indicate that the economy is lifting and that the country is growing. We are seeing that reflected also in today's September labour force numbers and of course in the all ordinaries index on the stock market. This country is off and moving—all the more reason why this parliament, which must take responsibility for piloting the economy through these changes, should not be putting any impediments in its way. That is why I say again to the Leader of the Opposition: the behaviour of the federal opposition in the Senate is now one of the clear impediments to the economy's progress.

The honourable member for Werriwa made a number of observations—observations that he has made over the years. He makes those observations in spite of the fact that the wine industry has been prospering despite the fact that he warned us against introducing any form of sales tax for the industry some years ago.

         The honourable member for Werriwa says that we should acknowledge the different circumstances of wine and beer. Of course, the government's measures do precisely that because there is both sales tax and excise applied to beer. In the case of wine, there is only wholesale sales tax. It is an issue of whether there should be fairer treatment between beer and wine, not a question of equality. It is the question of fairer treatment which led the government to make its decision to impose a higher level of wholesale sales tax on wine and of course, because of the differences between wine production and beer production, to eschew the proposal which has sometimes been floated, particularly by the beer industry, to impose excise on wine.

         The Leader of the Opposition should understand that, if his campaign were successful in defeating the government's measure in this regard, that would not be the end of the government's options to get a better and fairer system of taxation for the wine industry. As a result of discussions with some of the members of this industry, the government put forward a proposal which involves the more gradual introduction of a higher level of taxation for wine.

         In the context of that phase-in, there would be a number of major improvements as far as the taxation treatment of the industry was concerned: firstly, there would be the introduction of rapid depreciation allowances in relation to the development of grape growing areas; and, secondly, there would be essentially a threshold of $50,000 on production, below which no sales tax would be applied at all. This would be a very great benefit to smaller producers, of which there are 600 or 700 throughout Australia, at the same time as we dealt with this issue of bringing about a fairer treatment of the taxation of beer versus wine.

        This is a ringing endorsement from the IMF of the strategy which the government has embarked upon to provide the necessary stimulus to the economy in the short term when it needs it but at the same time have a credible legislative package involving the reduction in the budget deficit over the years ahead precisely for the reasons that we want to ensure an increase, a boost to confidence, we want to guard against rises in interest rates and we want to provide the necessary circumstances for an increase in investment and the jobs which will flow from that. As the Prime Minister has indicated, so many of the statistics which are now coming out do reveal an economy which is growing, an economy which has been able to attract considerable international investor confidence, an economy which is doing better than most OECD economies. As the Prime Minister said, the only impediment to the achievement of the objectives that we should all want for this country is the attitude of the opposition in relation to this budget deficit reduction strategy.

The Democrats are prepared to embrace the idea of a deficit reduction. Even the Greens, with ideas which we do not accept, have embraced that particular proposal. It is only the opposition which is standing in the way and wanting to maintain and expand government deficits in Australia. It is the opposition alone which wants to see an increase of about $3 billion in the deficit confronting Australia four years from now. It does not matter what antics members of the opposition want to inspire in the Senate, it does not matter what they want to do to try to break linkages between one part of this package and another, we simply cannot legislate away the economic reality confronting this country; we cannot legislate away the essential responsibility which this government will never abandon.

It is easy for the opposition to engage in this kind of feel good political experience which it seems to be having at the moment where it thinks that tax cuts can be given away without the other side of the equation being affected. Yet it is an essential part of the economic reality confronting Australia that we simply cannot have one without the other. It is about time the opposition realised that, it is about time it realised its part in the management of the Australian economy and it is about time it passed the necessary legislation so that the government can not only give effect to the early payment of those tax cuts but also provide the credible demonstration of our determination to reduce the deficit over the medium term.

         —Perhaps he is in his office watching the television relay. The Racial Discrimination Act is very proud legislation of a former Labor government. It is legislation that, as far as I am aware, has not been the subject of one single comment by any member of the opposition over the preceding months. The third and final point is that the question raises a matter which is obviously and quite publicly known to be the subject of negotiations, consultations and cabinet considerations. Therefore, it is inappropriate to respond further.

         The government welcomes the statement which was made by John Kaputin, the Papua New Guinea foreign minister, on 29 September to the effect that the Papua New Guinea government will consider convening a meeting of leaders on Bougainville to address the need for a peaceful solution of the problems on that troubled island and on the decision of the governments of Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands jointly to negotiate a formal arrangement on the management of their common border.

         We view these announcements as a very positive step on the road towards an eventual peaceful solution of the troubling Bougainville problem. It has long been this government's firm view that a purely military approach to the problems of Bougainville cannot succeed. There is a need for a process of dialogue between the various groups involved in the conflict in order for a peaceful solution to be achieved. Indeed, I would reinforce that by saying that the Prime Minister, when he discussed these matters with Prime Minister Wingti in Nauru at the forum, made the same point. I would hope that, as a result of the statements that have been made, the Papua New Guinea government will in fact endorse the convening of a meeting of Bougainville leaders. It will not be an easy process to bring about peace as a result of that, given the divisions which exist between Bougainvilleans as a result of the conflict.

         Australia has offered to assist in facilitating such a meeting, either by providing a venue or some other form of logistic support. That offer, I repeat to the House, still stands, provided of course that all the parties to the Bougainville conflict agree that our assistance would be appropriate. Those problems on Bougainville have dragged on for some four years, with tragic consequences for the population in terms of loss of life and the lack of basic services, such as health care. The effects of the Bougainville problem have also, as the honourable member referred to in his question, spilt over to affect the population of the neighbouring Solomon Islands, and those events have been without precedent in the South Pacific region and remain of great concern to the Australian government.

         Since the Bougainville problem began in 1989, Australia has provided relief aid to Bougainvilleans, including medicines, tents, clothing and tools. Now that conditions are improving on the island, we are stepping up our efforts to restore services on Bougainville. Indeed, on 23 September I announced an additional $2 million of assistance for the rehabilitation of Bougainville, and that will bring our total assistance to Bougainville—both expended and pledged—to some $4.6 million since April 1991.

The fact of the matter is that it has been the Prime Minister and the government that have unquestionably taken the high moral ground and, more importantly, sought, through national leadership, to embark upon the consultations that the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party has just referred to. I say to the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party that we are not ashamed that we talk to the Aboriginal people of this country; we are not ashamed that we talk to the National Farmers Federation, the Mining Industry Council and the state and territory governments. For goodness sake, that is what national leadership is about. We always have admitted that it is very difficult to get a national consensus around this great moral issue. But the national consensus, based on principles of justice for Aboriginal people, is what we are trying to get. No amount of spoiling from the federal opposition, no amount of wrecking, is going to divert us from that historic national objective.

         We visited the areas bounded by Wangaratta, Shepparton and Benalla, and we inspected the flood damaged area. We talked to people affected by the floods, as we did with the relief workers. The point that should be made at the outset is that the community involvement in rallying to the cause has been an extraordinary outcome, given the circumstances the community has faced. The good spirits with which the people were facing up to the task today is to be commended. But the reality is that a lot of damage appears to have been done by these floods. It is damage that impacts upon the area within my portfolio—the pastoral activity—particularly in relation to fencing, to crops, to stock losses, but it also impacts upon the homes and the small businesses that are the backbone of the city areas that we visited.

         As for the assistance that has been able to be given to date, it is important to note the logistic support on the ground has been extremely well-coordinated—the services of the armed forces from the Commonwealth level, combined with the state emergency services, have been extremely successful. They have been able to respond quickly not only to the enormous damage that came so quickly in itself, but their activities today seemed to have saved Cobram from the damage that has befallen a number of other areas. I would like to place on record the appreciation that this side of the House—and I am sure that the honourable members for Murray and Indi would join with me—has for the work that has been put in by the relief agencies.

         As for financial support, the Commonwealth and states are already funding, on a dollar for dollar basis, temporary hardship relief. It was pleasing to see the relief agencies fully employed at work processing these claims. In addition, assistance can be obtained by residents for temporary living expenses, for house and content damage, for structural repairs, and for re-establishment grants. Again, the agencies on the ground are providing the available material.

         As far as the future is concerned, until there is a proper assessment of the quantum of damage, it will be hard to say what the measure of financial support will total. The total will comprise a commitment from all levels of government, particularly the Commonwealth and the states. We have in place a framework for funding arrangements whereby, once certain thresholds are reached by the state, that will trigger further, matching funding from the Commonwealth. Once the trigger level is reached we will employ the formula of matching every dollar that the state puts in with three from the Commonwealth. We need further discussions with the state government on the level of assistance that will be required and the form in which it will be delivered.

         Meeting the need now is an important dimension to this situation, but we also need to recognise that measures already taken by the government have helped alleviate what might otherwise have been worse damage in the area of Wangaratta. That assistance came through contributions from the Commonwealth to raise the levy banks.

        , a journalist called Lindsay Olney wrote in an article, amongst other things, that I had misconstrued the meaning of the words in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration into the fuel excise. The journalist claimed, contrary to the views of the deputy chairman of the committee, who I would have thought ought to know, that the expression `The Committee noted that the Opposition opposes the bills but hopes that the Government may accept or introduce needed amendments' means that it is the opposition that wants the amendments. Mr Olney does not seem to have understood that it is the committee which wants the amendments, and that is perfectly clear from the paragraph, and to suggest that I have misunderstood this paragraph is wrong—and my interpretation has been well supported by the deputy chairman of the committee and other officials.

        There is nothing particularly dramatic about this motion. It encapsulates what has become some substantial practice over time concerning the relationship between the House and the Senate requesting appearance at each other's committee procedures. From the time when parliament was first established and the possibility arose of committees in one chamber being interested in the views of members in another chamber, a degree of practice has been built up which now effectively has the force of convention.

         I am a little surprised by the way in which the Senate's resolution was couched. It was slightly, in its terminology, outside the normal practice between the Houses. Nevertheless, from time to time missives have passed between the Houses requesting that a member of one particular chamber attend before members of another chamber. The practice has grown so that there is an opportunity provided for members, if they so wish, to appear before committees of another House. Early practice required a resolution to be passed in the chamber granting leave to a member if that member wished to appear before a Senate committee. But over time there has been a standing practice, and such advice has been forthcoming, that when a request is made leave is not required for an appearance before Senate committees. A member can do that of his or her own volition. The Senate from time to time has been advised on that matter. Anything further—that is, requiring somebody's attendance before a committee—is something that no House has done. Both Houses have assumed the inviolate status of their own individual members.

         One other point I make is that in recent times the previous Speaker appeared before a Senate committee without leave of the House or without having requested the House for leave. I think he discussed certain housekeeping matters before one of the Senate committees responsible for such matters. He did not believe that it was necessary, operating on advice that this chamber had repeatedly advised the Senate on such housekeeping matters over the years, to seek leave of the House in order to do that.

         This issue last occurred in some equivalent form to the matters that we are considering today during the period of government of our predecessors. The then Minister for Communications, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), was requested by the Senate to appear and give sworn testimony before it. At that stage, he gave a personal explanation as to why he was not prepared to do that. The matter related to issues of the international trade agreement on the selling of milk powder. The Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations, Senator Rae, had set down some particulars of evidence and invited comments from the then minister. He responded with a letter detailing his views, which were at variance with a witness who had appeared before the Senate, and decided further, however, that he would not appear to give sworn testimony on that issue. He said, inter alia, during his remarks on why he chose that course of action:

        I do not believe it appropriate that a Minister of this House should appear and give sworn evidence before a committee of the other House.
       </para>
       <para>
        He took that point somewhat further than is perhaps implicit here and said that not only did he think it was not right for him to appear voluntarily, but that a minister should simply not appear before a Senate committee and give sworn evidence in that particular manner. I have moved this motion to pick up something of the spirit of that last substantial precedent for this set of events. I have, nevertheless, made it quite clear that I have not taken this issue as far as the then Minister for Communications did when he seemed to be implying in his remarks that not only should a minister not be compelled to appear before a Senate committee, but a minister should never appear before a Senate committee to give sworn testimony. That was his view at the time, and this chamber did not disabuse him of that view. Ministers may, from time to time, wish to appear voluntarily before a Senate committee and I do not see any harm in that.

         In these circumstances, the request that has been put forward by the Senate that this chamber require the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) to appear before one of its committees is one that, in the normal course of events, honourable members on either side of this chamber have simply never tolerated. Honourable members on both sides of this chamber have been sensibly defensive of members' rights to independence of such requests. I think it will be quite useful to pass this motion because it will advise the Senate and set down pretty clearly the fact that it now encapsulates a whole raft of practice. Hopefully, it will encourage senators who may think of this sort of thing in the future to bear that in mind and perhaps not approach us in the way in which they have on this occasion.

         —The genesis of the motion of the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) is, I think, worth reflecting on. It goes back to a time last year when the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) first got himself into very substantial difficulties. Indeed, during the so-called Victorian Loan Council crisis in which the Treasurer was involved, he was, on a number of occasions, asked to resign from the position of Treasurer. It is perfectly clear from a body of evidence that has been brought before both houses of parliament that, on other occasions, the Treasurer simply misled the House. The Treasurer's activities in this Victorian Loan Council affair can be described as little short of disgraceful. The story is, of course, as honourable members would well know—

         —Of course I am dealing with the substance of the motion, which is simply a question of whether or not the Treasurer should be required to attend a Senate committee. The reason that this question arises is because last year the  Treasurer, on a number of occasions, tried to argue that he was unaware that the then Labor government in Victoria had exceeded its Loan Council determined limits and, at the same time, the Commonwealth published documentation in its budget last year showing that the Victorian government had not exceeded those limits.

         The simple proposition here was that the Treasurer knew from communications between his office and the office of the then Premier of Victoria, Mrs Kirner, that the Victorian government had exceeded its Loan Council limits at the very time the Treasurer was publishing budget documents which apparently showed that Victoria had not exceeded its Loan Council limits. This was a clear political exercise. It was an exercise designed to try to prop up the flagging stocks of the Victorian government, to allow it to borrow more money than it should have been allowed to borrow and to do so without revealing the trick that had been played on the Loan Council and therefore on the Australian people.

         The Victorian government was able to use this money in order to try to bribe voters to support it at the election, a tactic that failed. The fact is that on this occasion the Treasurer failed to fulfil his obligations to this House, to the parliament and to the people of Australia by stating in clarity in budget documents what the borrowings were of the different states in accordance with the rules of the Loan Council. That is the key to this whole debate.

         The Senate has established a committee, supported not only by the coalition but also by the Australian Democrats and chaired by Senator Coulter from the Australian Democrats, in order to investigate further this matter. Honourable members will recall that, when the coalition first asked the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) whether he would be prepared to ensure that the Treasurer appeared before this committee, his response was not only that he would not allow the Treasurer to appear before the committee—contrary to what the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) was saying a little earlier—but also that he would forbid ministers to appear before Senate committees.

         Honourable members may recall that it was in this context that extravagant language, such as the Senate being `unrepresentative swill', flowed from the lips of the Prime Minister. The fact is, though, that the Senate, whether the Australian Labor Party likes it or not—the Labor Party likes it when in opposition but not when in government—is a legitimate part of our constitution and a legitimate part of this parliament. Indeed, federation would never have occurred—there would never have been agreement to federation—had it not been for the creation of the Senate and the equal representation of the states in the upper house. Federation simply would not have occurred without it. The Senate is an integral part of our parliamentary system and it is therefore an integral part of the legislature.

         This debate ultimately revolves around the rights of the legislature in relation to the rights of the executive. The government is trying to say—the backbench members of the legislature do not have a free vote in the Labor Party—that the executive's wishes always supersede the wishes of the legislature. The executive is always superior to the legislature. This is the very principle that the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was talking about the other day in his memorable expression of Keating's republic, a republic where the executive is totally dominant and the legislature is simply subsumed or rendered irrelevant.

         This whole debate we are having at the moment about the Senate and its capacity to oppose financial and tax measures is another part of the same overall debate about the relationship between the executive and the legislature. The coalition, in the context of the budget in the Senate, is saying that the legislature is a fundamental part of our constitution and the executive was not established, was not elected, in order to govern as a dictatorship for three years without any consultation with the legislature but instead to use the legislature as nothing more than a rubber stamp.

         The motion that the Leader of the House has moved today says that the executive should, at the end of the day, in the upper house have a superior position to the legislature. The many requests that have been made by the Senate to have a minister appear before a parliamentary committee have been rejected. When we stop to contemplate why they have been rejected, we see that it is not only this point of principle—the relationship between the executive and the legislature—but also another attempt by the Australian Labor Party to prop up an ailing Treasurer, to prop up a man who has been in nothing but trouble as the Treasurer of this country.

         As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, this was simply the first of a whole range of different so-called resignation issues that the Treasurer himself became involved in. The last thing that the Labor Party wants is for the Treasurer, in the midst of a self-created budget crisis, to have to troupe across to appear before a Senate committee, or any parliamentary committee, and explain why he misled the parliament and misled the Australian people in relation to the Victorian Loan Council affair.

         I am certainly not moved to support this motion. I believe that the Treasurer should appear before the committee to give evidence. He should tell the committee what he knew at the time of the preparation of the budget papers last year. He should explain to the committee why he misled the parliament in the lead-up to the last Victorian election. He should explain why he and the then Premier, Mrs Kirner, were involved in an underhand, under-the-table attempt to try to prop up the fortunes of the ailing Labor government. The best way for that to happen is for the Treasurer to appear before the committee. If the government insists that the Treasurer does not appear before the committee, then we can ask only one question: what does the government have to hide? Why is the government protecting the Treasurer? The Leader of the House made it perfectly clear in his speech—the Prime Minister does not agree with this—that he himself was not opposed in principle to ministers appearing before Senate committees. But the Leader of the House is absolutely determined to make sure that the Treasurer does not appear before this committee. I wonder why. Is it a great issue of principle? Of course it is not. It is a simple issue of trying to protect a man whom the Leader of the House himself knows is a guilty man in relation to the Victorian Loan Council affair.

If we are—which I believe we are—then we have the right to call upon members of the executive, whether we are members of a Senate committee or a House of Representatives committee, to appear before that committee.

         The fact that we have had a situation in the past, which the honourable member for Watson and the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) have brought to our attention, does not mean to say that that should necessarily be cast in tablets of stone. We can hopefully look forward to a more effective functioning of the institution of parliament, as it is currently constituted in this country, to discharge its responsibilities as being representative of the people.

         From time to time, that may mean that members of the executive government are discomforted by being required to appear and explain their actions. We had a situation only this week in the House of Representatives where the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), with fickle determination, closed down question time. Therefore, members of both the government party and the opposition parties were not allowed to ask questions of the executive government. We have a situation where the opposition is not allowed to move motions of censure or propose matters of public importance. Because the executive government controls the numbers in the House of Representatives, we have a situation where the effective functioning of individual members has been set aside by the actions of this government.

         When I hear the Prime Minister stand up and talk about the setting aside of parliamentary conventions by the opposition and when I see the way in which he has treated the institution of the House of Representatives in recent times, it causes me to question his capacity for analysis and for having any relation to truthfulness when he speaks. Leaving that aside, we are members of the institution of parliament in this country. Whether we are in the Senate or the House of Representatives, we pride ourselves on being elected and having these rights and duties. If that is the case, and if the executive government is subservient to the role of the legislature—the houses of parliament—then neither the Leader of the House, who is at the table, nor the honourable member for Watson can argue along the lines that they have.

         In this situation, the legislature—the houses of parliament: the Senate and the House of Representatives—and its institutions must prevail over the government of the day. Therefore, on a matter of principle, I think it is only proper and right that if a properly constituted Senate or House of Representatives committee requires a minister of the day to appear before it and explain his or her actions, that minister should appear. To set that principle aside, I think, is to demean the overall responsibilities and importance of the houses of parliament of this country. I think that we, and any government of any political persuasion, should look very carefully at adopting that point of view.

         The political wheel turns, as we all know, but what we as members of parliament on both sides of the political equation seek is to enhance and develop the role of parliament as an effective arbiter of democracy in this country. I do not think that is putting it too strongly. If we seek to denigrate, or if we effectively denigrate, that role by the executive government using its numbers in the House of Representatives to absolve itself of that responsibility, I think it derogates very greatly from the role of parliament as a whole. Therefore, on a question of high principle, I would oppose the proposition being put by the government at this stage.

         —I will be very brief. I would like to rise in support of the comments of the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar). He put his comments very well. This is a very interesting debate and is part of the changing role of the Senate. The issue really boils down to the accountability of executive government. If there is any issue in this country that has caused problems over the last decade in Australia, it is the failure of executive governments to be accountable to parliaments. For better or for worse, the Senate is part of the parliament. I see the accountability of the executive as an important principle which will certainly improve the workings of the whole legislature. We are seeing a change in the role of the Senate, which has occurred as a result of the change to proportional voting.

Unless the government can find some way to alter the voting system for the Senate, I do not think any group will ever again dominate the Senate. This is going to cause quite a change in our system of government. But the government should not be particularly worried about it.

         American cabinet ministers have had to put up with this sort of situation since time immemorial. It is interesting to note that, when the American government's health policy was recently launched, the President was required to go before six committees of the legislature—six committees. This situation is accepted by the President and all the committee members. This might be horrific to people who are used to the style of executive government just handing down policies on tablets of stone and saying that not a line will be changed, as it has been in the previous system. But we have passed that era and it is no good harking back to the past and trying to be conservative about it. This principle of the accountability of the executive is something that we should all support.

         —I would like to complete the North Shore contiguous trilogy and join the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) and the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) in expressing opposition to the motion that has been put forward. I think it is important to analyse exactly what is being proposed here by the Senate. The Senate is not purporting to assert a superior power over this House. It is not even purporting to assert a collateral relationship with this House. All the Senate is doing is requesting the House of Representatives to do something. The issue is not the pride of the House of Representatives, or the sensitivity of members of the House of Representatives to the Senate. The matter at issue is whether members of the House of Representatives are prepared to tell the executive to do something. That is the issue.

         I will come in a moment to what may have happened in 1981. But it seems to me, for example, that if this House had properly constituted legislation committees, which many people believed it should have, it would have been very strange if ministers were not required to attend meetings of those particular committees. In those circumstances, I do not have any trouble at all in opposing this motion. There is a political history to it, which my colleague the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) has dealt with very adequately.

         Let me come to the question of what happened in 1981. On that occasion there was no such request and, as a result, there was no vote taken in this parliament on that particular issue. I do not want to go into all of the background of that issue. Because I was not directly involved my own recollection of it is fairly thin. I do not know whether the government of the day would have taken the same attitude as the government is now taking had it faced a request from the Senate—and I say this to the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay)—but the fact is that it did not. Whether it might have or might not have is, in a sense, irrelevant. If we are really interested in making intelligent decisions about what is the right thing to do now, then it is a rather absurd proposition to say that a political party or a group of individuals either here or elsewhere cannot change their minds on something over a period of 11 years, 20 years, or 30 years—even if they did have a different view 11 years or 15 years ago.

         I do very strongly endorse what my colleague the honourable member for Warringah has said. This is an issue of the supremacy of parliament over the executive. The government is asserting that this House has no right to make ministers in this House accountable for their ministerial responsibilities. I think that it is an untenable proposition. It shows how deeply ingrained is the authoritarian view of executive government on the Labor Party side. When I made that remark several days ago about a foretaste of republican rule under the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating), I really did mean it, because part and parcel of the constitutional agenda that the current Prime Minister has in mind is to more deeply embed the notion of executive authoritarianism. The genius of the Westminster system has always been—with whatever imperfections—to make the executive accountable before the parliament itself.

         I simply conclude by saying that we are asking the House of Representatives to respond to a request—not a direction, not an instruction—from the Senate to require one of our own ministers to attend before the Senate. I think that is, in constitutional terms, an entirely proper request. I think it would be the right thing to comply with it, and I hope the House does. For those reasons, the coalition in this place will oppose the motion that has been moved by the minister.

I remind the honourable gentleman that the traditions of Westminster are very clear on this particular point. The privileges that are attached to the House of Commons and to the House of Lords are separate privileges. I know of no occasion when the House of Lords has sought, as a matter of privilege, to exert its authority over any member of the House of Commons. Equally, in our system, which is based upon the Westminster system, it is perfectly clear that the privileges which are attached to this House are the responsibilities of this House, and the privileges that attach to the Senate are its responsibilities.

         For the opposition to come into this House, as a blind sort of exercise, and make a whole range of allegations against the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) first of all undermines the processes of this House, because if those allegations had any substance in fact then there are processes of this House available to the opposition within this parliament to raise those issues. A great deal of nonsense is now being talked about the Senate. It was constituted first of all as a states house—a states house! When has the Senate or any group of senators ever sought the view on any particular issue of the states they purport to represent? It has never occurred and it never will occur. A house of review it may be for those members of the Greens or the Australian Democrats who do not have any representation in this House. But for those opposite to say of their senatorial colleagues—who go with them dutifully every Monday, Tuesday or whenever they meet in their party room, who deliberate on every political issue that is going to be raised by the coalition and who put their hands up to say yea or nay to a particular process or to a particular policy—that they shed their parliamentary affiliations when in the Senate and become members of a house of review is not only political nonsense but also a political lie.

Of course it has. While I do not agree with all of the honourable member's positions—for example, his attitude towards the monarchy and British traditions—he nevertheless has had my respect.

In effect, he was saying that we should curtail the privileges of this House.

         —in reply—There has been quite an interesting debate on both sides of the chamber about a matter of parliamentary privilege. There are one or two points I want to make in winding up the debate. The honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) and the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) alluded to whether ministers ought to appear before Senate committees. That is not prohibited by this motion. It goes to the question of whether a minister or any other member of this House should be required to do so.

         It is perfectly appropriate for ministers and members of the House to appear—if they want—before any set of Senate committees. Apparently we have tried to educate the Senate over the years—in times before mine—that it does not need to request leave of this House. If it is to make a request, it is a request about leave. We have suggested from time to time that the Senate should obviate that process and go straight to the member concerned and ask whether he or she would like to turn up—not bother us with it. But that procedure is now time honoured as an interpretation of the appropriate relationship between the chambers.

         Ministers are members of parliament in the first instance—they are ministers second—and are therefore no different from any other person in this House when that occurs. A particular case from which we considered a lot of material for this motion was that of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). He asserted two things, one of which we would not completely agree with and the other which is interesting to note in this case. As far as we are concerned it is the appropriate way for the Senate to have proceeded.

         The chairman of the Senate committee which requested the presence of the right honourable member at that time was Senator Rae, a Liberal senator from Tasmania. His request was not expressed via the House of Representatives or the Senate. Operating properly and sensibly on the basis of what by then had become the practice of Senate committees, of communicating directly, knowing that it is not necessary to seek leave for a voluntary appearance, he wrote to the honourable member and asked whether he would like to appear and swear on oath that other evidence that had been given on oath was false or incorrect. Mr Sinclair did two things. Firstly, he sent a letter saying he was not going to appear. Secondly, he said that he did not believe that it was appropriate to make a minister appear on oath before a Senate committee. He said:

         —No, we are not. There was no resolution on this side of the House, to my recollection, to that effect. There were plenty of motions on the conflict of evidence between what the right honourable member had to say about the circumstances of the Asia Dairy Industries inquiry and what the witnesses had to say. We had quite a lot to say about it in this House. In the circumstances, as far as I am aware, and certainly not from any of the evidence in

         , we did not require the right honourable member to appear before that committee in response to that committee's request that he might do so. So I think it is very important that we contemplate what is actually in this motion. This motion does not prohibit any minister appearing before a committee of the other place. It does not prohibit any member appearing before a Senate committee. What it does prohibit is the compulsion of that course of action by either House.

         There will arise, from time to time, opportunities to make political hay by utilising majorities in one place or the other. One can think of quite a few occasions in which it might be nice for members on this side of the House to find an opportunity to harass the odd tormenter that we discover in the Senate. It would not take the art of a person of the understanding and long experience of the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) to dream up one or two things that might have the odd member of the Liberal Party in the Senate before a House of Representatives committee having an exceptionally interesting time. But the fact of the matter is that we do not do that sort of thing—though, it is obviously open to us—and on the interpretation of the—

We are not yet sure of the honourable member's cross-examination capacity as it was not evident then, and it is yet to be tested. It may or may not be good.

         It has not been my intention to deal with the actual issues in terms of the procedures of the Senate committee itself. I have been more interested in this motion in relation to the appropriate relationship between members of this chamber and members of the other chamber. But since one or two of the spokesmen on the other side had a deal to say about that, I might say this: this is a product of a tawdry exercise prior to the last election. It is an effort to use those numbers to embarrass the government for political effect. Although that sort of behaviour ought not to be encouraged in any set of circumstances, it certainly ought not to be encouraged to the detriment of the longstanding privileges and rights of this House and the members of this House. For those reasons, I trust that the House will support this motion.

         —For those who are sitting in the galleries this afternoon, I should explain that Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 1993-94 seeks to spend about $5 billion of taxpayers' money. The government will close the debate at 4.10 p.m. The government proposes that the parliament will have four minutes, at about $1 billion a minute, to consider Appropriation Bill (No. 2), one of the main budget bills that appropriates taxpayers' funds for the running of the ordinary services of government. The bill provides for proposed expenditure on capital works, various advances in loans, plant and equipment and expenditure on new initiatives flowing from legislation previously approved. The appropriation bill also appropriates the money which has already been supplied to the government under supply bills to keep it going until these appropriation bills go through.

         The appropriation bills make up the government's budget package. Let it be made clear that the opposition is not voting against the appropriation bills; it is not voting against budget bills. The opposition is not seeking to prevent the government having the money available to run the ordinary services of government. From the way the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has been carrying on in the last couple of days, one would think the reverse was true. He wound himself up at the beginning of this week, no doubt sitting in his chair listening to his Mahler symphonies, to say that some huge breach of convention would happen in this parliament.

         The fact is we will not be opposing Appropriation Bill (No. 2), Appropriation Bill (No. 1) having already gone through. What we are opposing are those pernicious and regressive taxes that the government did not announce before the election but which it popped on the Australian people afterwards in breach of its mandate, the promises that it had made and the faith that the Australian people had, we said misguidedly, shown in it at the election. The government has made sure that every Australian is today paying more for his or her petrol, more wholesale sales tax and more wine tax, although it has not even been through the parliament yet. The government has completely breached whatever mandate it got after the election.

         This is a government that said before the election that its income tax cuts were l-a-w and that it did not need any indirect tax increases. It is a government which conned the Australian people into believing it, pretended that it would not raise tax and then, after it was elected into office, turned around and did all the things that it said it would not do.

         The opposition is saying that governments have to be kept accountable. There is a point in having an election: it is to give people the choice between policies. They get a choice between policies only if the policies that they have chosen are actually held against the government of the day. That is why we in the opposition have made no bones from the very outset about the fact that we do not believe this government has a mandate to increase the wholesale sales tax, to increase the price of petrol, to retrospectively tax annual leave and to increase the tax on wine. We do not support that. We believe it was a breach of the electoral promises that were made, and we will vote against them.

         —Those people sitting in the gallery have just watched the parliament appropriate $5 billion worth of taxes. That is the way in which this government runs this parliament. That is the way in which it allows this parliament to scrutinise where all of those taxes, which it sucks from the public at petrol bowsers, supermarkets and everything else it can get its hands on, are spent.

         Now we come to another appropriation. Honourable members will be pleased to know that this time we have got about 40 minutes to spend $126 million. This relates to the appropriation for parliamentary departments, including the Department of the House of Representatives and the Department of the Senate, which operate separately. This bill seeks appropriations of about $126 million for the running costs to keep those parliamentary departments going. We might well ask, `Is that $126 million being well spent?', when at the end of the day there is only five minutes to scrutinise the expenditure of $5 billion. I am not saying for a moment that this is the fault of the staff of the House of Representatives and the staff of the Senate, who work long, hard and well.

I sometimes think that they must see some of their hopes dashed when the government introduces guillotines and rules, as it has. Those who have given a lifetime of service, because they believe in this particular institution and what it stands for, must look aghast at the way in which the government performs its legislative timetable as it is at the moment under this guillotine.

         The history of parliament is a history of the people wresting power from monarchs. Nations basically sprang into existence under the rule of the king. The area that the king could control became his kingdom, and the modern derivation is of course a nation. The principle was rex is lex—the king is law. The whole history of parliament was the assertion of the people grabbing power off monarchs. After a period, monarchs used to appoint ministers. The parliament then began to assert its right to scrutinise those ministers—its right to bring those ministers down—and to assert the right that there could not be taxation without representation and that money could only be appropriated for ministers to run functions of government with parliamentary approval. We got to the position in modern parliamentary democracy where the parliament had wrested from the monarch, from the executive, all of those important and significant powers.

         The way the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) carries on—he is known as the number one republican—he would, no doubt, like to go back to the practice of the autocratic Stuarts. He would like to wrest back the powers from the parliament to the executive when it comes to scrutiny of government, exercising powers to ensure that administration is being carried out properly, inquiries and investigations, and question time. Question Time is a procedure which is designed to make the executive accountable to the parliament as representing the people, so ministers have to come in and answer questions.

         The first derogation from the principle that the Prime Minister seems to have practised so well is the principle of never answering a question. Every question is treated as an absolute opportunity to make a speech about whatever happens to be exercising his mind or whatever insults seem to be flowing out of his mouth at that time. On some occasions, when question time goes particularly badly, as we saw on Tuesday of this week, the Prime Minister ups and outs of this place. He walked out after the second question was answered or was attempted to be answered because the day was going badly for the government. Asserting the old autocratic impulses that make him so reminiscent of the Stuart monarchy, he walked out of the parliament and refused to take any more questions.

         The behaviour is not only bad in relation to question time. The opposition generally has the opportunity to debate the issue of the day in a matter of public importance. It has the opportunity to raise on behalf of the electorate what it considers to be a matter of pressing importance on that day and to debate it. The Prime Minister has absolutely abolished that for the whole month. So there is no opportunity in this parliament to raise, on behalf of the people of Australia, the issues that concern them for the whole month—to debate them, to bring them to the government's attention and to probe the government where it might be going wrong.

         The Prime Minister not only did that; he then said that he would suspend standing orders, so if there were any censure motions or no confidence motions to be moved they could not be moved for a month. Apparently it does not matter how badly the ministry performs in that month, we do not even get the opportunity to move a censure motion or a want of confidence motion in order to bring these issues to the attention of the parliament or the people of Australia—whether it be question time, matters of public importance, censure motions, no confidence motions; all those important parliamentary conventions. This Prime Minister shows no interest in all of those important parliamentary conventions that make an executive and a ministry accountable to the people; in fact, he shows blatant disregard and contempt for the institution of parliament and the way in which it operates.

They believe that it represents a great breaching of the mandate of the government at the last election. Those opposite came in here on the first question time of the week, one of the few opportunities left to ask the government how it operates, and it turned out that this convention, which had been long set out in stone, which could not be defied because of parliamentary practice in this country, and which had got the Prime Minister worked up into a lather on the

         When the questions and statements were put to the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), who was the shadow Treasurer in the last Labor opposition, about how he had acted in relation to the sales tax bills, which had been part of the budget bills, it turned out that he had not only voted and led the charge against those bills but had also succeeded in knocking off sales tax bills. The Minister for Finance did it in these terms on 27 August 1981 when he said:

       <para>
        That is what he said in 1981. He knew there was no convention in 1981 on voting against sales tax bills in a budget that he opposed. He not only knew that, but he also argued against there being any convention, and he actually led the opposition in voting against them. In August 1981, the Minister for Finance, who was then shadow Treasurer, also said:

         The government has been quite honest in its budget forecast that its tax measures will lift inflation. These are regressive taxes because they fall on the rich and the poor equally, and they do nothing for the equity of the tax system.

          The Minister for Finance knew there was no convention when it came to blocking tax measures. He knew that the Prime Minister's attempt to assert such a convention was a deception. He knew that because he had led the charge against sales tax measures as shadow Treasurer in 1981. He not only led the charge, but he was also successful in the assault. He was so successful that in 1981 these sales tax bills were rejected by the Senate within the terms of section 57 of the Constitution. It was no token opposition; it was an opposition that actually succeeded, and led to the double dissolution in 1983.

         When the Minister for Finance tried to amplify or elaborate upon the reasons why in 1981 the opposition had taken that very same position, he went to great lengths to say that this was a convention that had been broken by both sides of the House. I ask: what sort of convention is broken by both sides of the House? No convention at all. There is no such thing as a convention that is not observed. In his mind the Prime Minister is probably confusing the word `convention' with `invention' when it comes to voting against tax measures, and the Minister for Finance is quite open about that. He said that he was justified in taking that position in 1981 because of the circumstances—they were regressive taxes and all the rest of it. That is exactly the reason why we say we are justified in 1993 in taking that position. The taxes are regressive, they do nothing for the economy and, even worse, they represent a massive fraud on the Australian people.

         The second, and later, attempt said that this convention came into action upon the deregulation of the Australian financial system. This was a much better gloss on this convention because this actually allowed one to say that all oppositions which had voted against tax measures prior to 1981 were justified in doing so. They were justified because the convention which said that opposition parties did not vote against budget tax bills only came into effect with financial deregulation. The genius of this position was that financial deregulation only came in after this government came into office. So the convention that stopped oppositions voting against tax bills only applies to this opposition for the benefit of this government. It did not apply when the present government was in opposition and we were in government. This was quite a clever one indeed.

         When the current Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), the then shadow treasurer, was leading the attack on budget tax measures in 1981, he said that the tax measures would adversely affect the living standards of Australian families. I was amused to pull out the speech he made in defence of that proposition because it relied upon a paper by Mr Neil Warren in relation to distributional effects as evidence to show that the Labor opposition in 1981 was justified in voting against those sales tax measures. Dr Neil Warren, as he is now, of the University of New South Wales, prepared a distributional analysis of the current budget, which was released by the coalition on 8 September. It found that by 1996-97 the budget would leave all Australians worse off. The principle asserted in 1981 by the then shadow Treasurer relied on the same person who, when he analysed the current Treasurer's budget, came to the same conclusion—that the 1996-97 budget would leave all Australians worse off. On the principles that were argued then as to why budget tax measures should be opposed, this government strikes out—strike one.

         Back in 1981 the then shadow Treasurer said that the Fraser government's tax measures would regressively affect the equity of the tax system. Dr Warren's analysis shows beyond a shadow of a doubt that the lowest income Australians are hardest hit by this budget. A person earning less than $2,700 does not get a tax cut. At best, that person would get $3 of guilt money, as some kind of sop for the government's failure to take into account those who are on lower income levels.

The poor people who cannot afford to drive motor cars that use unleaded petrol get another 2c a litre slug. These taxes are designed to slug those on lower incomes harder. Those on lower incomes will pay the same measure of tax increase as those on higher incomes.

This government won an election opposing any changes to the indirect tax system. The government said that changes to the indirect tax system would be a life-changing matter, that they would be the death of Australian buyers, mothers and housewives for about a decade. The government said that the world would fall in the day after the election if the coalition's proposed changes to the indirect system ever came about.

If we want Australians to maintain faith in the political system on issues as big as indirect tax was during the election, we have to keep faith with the Australian people.

That is why the opposition has taken the view it has on these taxes. But rather than assert in hyperbolic, extravagant language that there is some great matter going on here, some great convention, the Prime Minister should concede that the great matter at issue here is the matter of mandates—Australian government mandates, his mandate, his prime ministership, his future, his commitment, his obligation to the Australian people.

         —The Loan Bill 1993 is a standard machinery financing bill necessary to supplement the moneys available to the consolidated revenue fund and to provide for certain Defence expenditures to be met from the loan fund, rather than the consolidated revenue fund. It is not legal for government expenditures to exceed the available funds within the consolidated revenue fund. As a result, successive governments have adopted the practice of introducing a loan bill of this type to cover the shortfall in the consolidated revenue fund.

         The point needs to be made that the necessity for this bill arises in cases only where there is a deficit in the consolidated revenue fund. When that is in balance—as it was in 1987-88, 1988-89 and 1989-90—the need for the loan bill does not arise. In those circumstances, there is an excess of funds rather than a shortage which is generally paid into a loans consolidation and investment reserve.

         Under those circumstances, Mr Deputy Speaker, the government actually behaves like you: it saves money and invests it rather than lending money in order to cover the shortfall. However, this is not the case this financial year. The loan bills provide for a loan fund of around $23 billion—which is principally made up of the expected budget deficit of over $16 billion and an additional $7 billion to cover required financing transactions and off-budget transactions. The bill provides the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) with the authority to keep topping it up to higher levels by further borrowing.

         The House needs to be aware that the charges that are made on this loan fund as a result of this bill represent a new high-water mark for borrowing by the government. A look back at the size of relative charges on the loan funds over the course of the past decade is revealing. In 1982-83, total charges made on loan funds by the loan acts amounted to $2.6 billion. The amount was $4.6 billion in 1985-86 and went to zero by 1989-90. In those years, there was no reason for borrowing through the loan fund because the Commonwealth account was running in surplus, as I said.

         However, from 1990-91 through to this budget the charges made on the loan fund have skyrocketed.

The necessity for, and the sheer size of, this year's loan fund highlights the massive deterioration in the Commonwealth's position and illustrates the total ineptitude of the Labor government when it comes to economic management. Massive loan provisions go hand in hand with massive budget deficits.

         The great irony is that the Treasurer maintains that this budget is a deficit reducing strategy. I suppose every long journey begins with the first step, but there would be very few long journeys that begin with the first step going in the opposite direction—very few indeed. This government, with its budget deficit reduction strategy, is actually going to increase its deficit in this financial year. It believes the deficit is reduced by taking it from negative $14.5 billion this year to negative $16 billion next year. It is a bit like going from Sydney to Melbourne by taking a trip to Brisbane. The government will reduce the deficit by increasing it to start with. Over the next four years, the government has a plan to reduce the deficit, but in this financial year it is actually going to increase it.

Just prior to the election, we were going to have a deficit of between 0.5 and one per cent by 1995-96. Later on during the election campaign, it was going to be one per cent by 1996-97.

         The government has broken its deficit reduction target four times in 18 months. How many times will it break it in the 36 months to 1996-97? Most in the press have rightly said that the government will again break its budget deficit reduction target. On current form, one would only have to say this is a horse that has form. If one were running dead, one would have to say that, in relation to budget deficit reduction targets, this government has a good track record.

         The fact is that Australians look only at the headline number in relation to budget deficit targets anyway. If we take out the snake oil and the smoke and the mirrors, the budget deficit of $16 billion that the government is talking about is probably closer to $23 billion. The government reaches the figure of $16 billion only by putting in the sale of capital assets, for which it says it will get $2.4 billion. That is another target that it never meets. It actually treats the sale of assets as recurrent revenue, which no reputable company would do. No reputable company would be allowed to say, `We sold off our office block and therefore our operating profit in this particular year was such and such.'

        A company would have to account for the sale of capital assets on its balance sheet. It would have to show at the beginning, and at the end of the year, the assets that it had. If it had one less asset than the funds at hand, that would represent the sum which it had received. The government takes that sale into account and puts it into revenue as a negative outlay. It includes that amount in relation to its budget deficit reduction target. It also brings into account the Reserve Bank's profits. The Reserve Bank actually makes money by buying and selling the Australian dollar. It brings $3.2 billion into account as a result and puts that figure into the bottom line. It also brings in government business enterprises that pay dividends and puts that into the bottom line.

         The other day we saw the scope and extent of the way in which this government will mug government business enterprises to get taxation revenue. Mugging a government business enterprise is the best way of getting tax. The enterprise is told that it has to pay money to the government. The enterprise then has to go out and find that money. Telecom, for example, is told to pay the government money; Telecom finds it by putting up phone charges or in other ways. This is a way in which the government can raise money without increasing taxes. A total of $850 million is supposed to come into the budget in that way. When one takes out the $850 million, the $3.2 billion and the $2.4 billion, the private sector says, and probably quite rightly, that the Commonwealth budget deficit is nearer to the $23 billion mark. It is about five per cent of our gross domestic product; a level that is only rivalled by the disastrous Whitlam experiment.

         These protracted high budget deficits come at a price. Principally, they run down national savings and they expose Australia to the whims of international financiers. Just over three months ago, the government received a report on Australia's parlous national savings. That report was known as the FitzGerald report. The report made it quite clear that the country was heading in the wrong direction in relation to savings. It warned that our savings position would not improve until the government began to save better. The report said:

        Just last week, the failure of the government on the national savings was again illustrated by the release of the ANZ Bank savings report for the June quarter. It recorded the largest fall in the stock of national savings since the series began. It once again highlighted the fact made clear by Dr FitzGerald that the savings shortage represents a serious threat to Australian economy.

         Bills such as this Loan Bill represent a call on savings. If the government was running a surplus, if it was building up savings, it would not be borrowing moneys. There would not be a loan bill. We have a loan bill which shows that the government itself is not funding its own operations and, worse, it is borrowing to keep going. The government is running down savings—savings which have been identified by Dr Vince FitzGerald as absolutely essential for economic recovery in the 1990s. The Commonwealth is sapping savings resources, reducing the stock of savings in Australia and contributing to debt.

         That debt is not just domestic but foreign as well. Our chronic current account deficit problem, on a monthly basis, feeds into ever burgeoning levels of foreign debt. The budget forecasts a further $18 billion of current account deficits this financial year. Foreign debt currently stands at $172 billion in net terms. By the time of the next budget, Australia will have made no progress. The ANZ's savings reports show that our savings dive is being led by the public sector and the government of Australia. The recent report stated that the record fall of 1.2 per cent of GDP in the stock of savings in the last quarter was the result of a 4.6 per cent plunge in public sector savings compared with an increase of 3.4 per cent by the private sector.

         In other words, national savings ran down. Why? Because the government ran them down by 4.6 per cent, and the private sector could only pull them back by 3.4 per cent. The government and the public sector are the chief villains responsible for running down Australia's savings. When the necessity for those loan bills did not arise in the late 1980s, when the Commonwealth was running surpluses and actually contributing to the loans and consolidation investment reserve, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer were swanning around as great saviours, great heroes—wonderfully successful. They were touting this as a great success. Those who take the success when they run surpluses are those who ought to be taking the blame when they run deficits.

As early as May 1987 the current Prime Minister said that the prospect of a budget surplus that year meant that Australians were `on the verge of freeing ourselves and our young people from the dictates of international financial markets'. Where are we now? We are $172 billion in debt—more subject to the dictates of the international financial markets than ever.

        It was an enormous claim—absolutely, enormously false. Three years ago he predicted that by now there would be no government debt—domestic or external.

That is the level of Commonwealth Government debt; that is what the government owes. It owes nearly $5,000 for every person in this country. Do not think this debt goes away; it does not magically evaporate. That debt has to be serviced. One of the largest expenditure items that we are starting to pay as part of our budget is the interest cost on public debt. I think in the budget the major areas that we spend money on are health, social security, defence and education. After that, the next major item on the list is servicing past debt. As the debt goes higher, the cost of servicing it goes up as well.

         People ought to remember that every dollar in the future that we have to pay off to service the debts that we are running up today is a dollar less that we will have for health, education, defence and social security.

Their choices will be much fewer, because they will see a good part of their taxation income going off to pay the debts of today. Down the track, when we look at how governments will try to put together budgets in the future, they will have far less choices because of the way in which the interest on past debt runs up more debt.

As I sat here thinking about the enormity of the problems facing us in Australia, I was astounded at the nature of the second reading speech given by the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) on this piece of legislation. He had the audacity to come into this House and say that this bill is a machinery financing measure. In his speech of a little under a page, he went on to outline the fact that this bill was to authorise the raising of moneys in the name of Australia to fund a deficit of $16 billion for 1993-94 and also to fund a prospective deficit in the consolidated revenue fund of about $7 billion higher.

         Most Australians, as they think about debt, worry about the enormity of the debt obligations as a whole facing Australia at the moment. Towards the end of August, when the figures came out for July, I noticed that Australia's net foreign debt had risen to $172 billion. When that amount is extrapolated for all Australians, it gives rise to an obligation of $10,000 for every man, woman and child in this country. Over time, the government has wanted to tell us that this is not a significant problem and that it is not something we need to worry about in the longer term.

         International lenders are usually pretty small investors, as are those in Australia, who save for their own future in retirement funds. They have set aside their small savings and lend through international banks and other financial institutions to Australia, Australian states, companies and financial institutions. These investors are lending to Australia. Even though some people suggest that when a company such as Mr Bond's company or Mr Skase's company goes broke we are under no obligation and that that will suddenly be written off, it is a fact that behind each of those obligations stands generally a bank and that behind each of those organisations stands the Reserve Bank of Australia when it lends through the Australian banking system. We cannot simply wish away these debts; they are a substantial and a growing obligation. Today our foreign debt now equals 42.9 per cent of our gross domestic product. That means that most Australians will have to find a substantial amount each year to repay the debt.

         On an annualised basis, when the debt reaches 42.9 per cent of the gross domestic product of Australia, the capacity to make those repayments on a regular basis is severely jeopardised. The point has often been stressed that when a country's debt reaches about 45 per cent of GDP it is seen internationally as being vulnerable in its ability to be able to meet its obligations. Australia is a matter of only some three per cent or so from being in that position.

         I have often likened Australia's situation to that of individuals who are unable to pay the mortgage debt on their houses. When their mortgages are related to the size of their yearly income and they are not in a position from their incomes to service the interest obligation, somebody is put in to manage their affairs and they end up being bankrupted. In relation to a nation, bankruptcy in that sense is not known, but something else is: the international community can assume the responsibility for giving advice and directions in relation to the management of a country's affairs.

These are the people who, in the longer term, even when the economy starts to recover, will not have the opportunity of getting into employment again. They will—proverbially—be left on the scrap heap, because of decisions such as this and decisions of the sort we see reflected in this Loan Bill.

         —Having listened to the previous speakers, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) and the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), I am even more alarmed than I was before the debate began. When we consider the $23 billion shortfall, the charges that go with it and the damage to our economy, we can begin to understand why Australia has some of its economic problems. No matter how much we like to talk in this place, we cannot escape the fundamental facts.

         The honourable member for Higgins pointed out the record of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating); he has got it wrong four times in 18 months. I could not help but think about the Prime Minister's answer in question time when he referred to the wonderful increase in the share market. I think the figure was $85 billion—I have yet to verify it. I note that the honourable member for Higgins said the Prime Minister was out by $85 billion when he said four or five years ago that there would be zero government debt. Perhaps that in itself is enough of a statement; wrong four times in 18 months on the deficit percentage and an $85 billion debt over the last four or five years when he said we would have zero government debt.

         One of the very high costs to our budget is the interest we pay on our debt. Repayments are just keeping us going. We are not making any progress. I can remember big headlines in a daily paper four or five years ago, before I was interested in politics—`$100 billion debt'. This was the mid-1980s. It seemed to creep up to $170 billion or $200 billion. Where will it stop—at $350 billion? Who is going to stop it? Certainly not the government.

         The honourable member for Berowra touched on the percentage of GDP—the 49 per cent, or whatever it might be. The matter of the IMF, which has been raised for a number of years, cannot be dismissed. But all this is just a simple distraction to the reality of this debt—and what the $23 billion is all about. We have had discussions about the republic and increased taxation. Since my time in parliament there has been discussion about this darned budget that people refuse to get organised. There is also the industrial relations package—but it is all peripheral stuff.

         As the honourable member for Higgins said, it is pretty interesting when we were going to take a big step forward and end up taking a bigger one backwards—the deficit for the year was a couple of billion dollars higher than the projection. There seems to be a casual disregard for our national sovereignty. This casual approach seems to be that we can keep burdening a productive sector—and it will keep producing.

Having a $23 billion shortfall, grandstanding on budgets and complaining and whingeing about Senates are not the answers. I come back again to the Prime Minister's answer at question time and the $85 billion. I still find it difficult to believe that there is an $85 billion improvement in the capitalisation of the share market, the same amount that the Prime Minister was deficient in when he said that few short years ago that there would be no debt.

         —One of the most amazing situations relating to this Loan Bill concerns the second reading speech of the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis). He told us that this is a machinery measure which is just going to borrow about $23 billion. It is an issue that has concerned me greatly, particularly when daily we have the government telling us about its responsibilities to reduce the budget deficit. The budget deficit is a matter of extreme concern, and of extreme concern to this side of politics. To demonstrate that we did not believe in such a policy—which I referred to throughout the last election campaign as being one of `let the children pay'—we went to the electorate with a plan which could balance revenue measures without putting such massive debt upon future generations of Australians.

         We have to look at the present levels of indebtedness, as shown in the budget, in the light of the sort of indebtedness that Australia anticipates it will incur with the rest of the world. There is no argument that during the 1980s it was business that generally borrowed the money. As a result of that practice, the government became the beneficiary of that debt by way of taxes. It might sound funny to say that people were getting into debt and the government got taxes, but it did because business was using borrowed money to ramp up the values of all sorts of assets throughout the community—shares, property, et cetera. Even our deluded woolgrowers—whom we will try to deal with again this afternoon—through the organisation representing them internationally, the Wool Corporation, kept borrowing money to pay themselves inflated values for wool that the international markets would not pay, and then paid taxes on the proceeds.

         We had the same situation with all the entrepreneurs ramping up the value of shares and property, and some of those entrepreneurs are reappearing. Our major institutions, such as the AMP and other insurance companies, were in on it too. But they were not producing any more. They were not putting any productive value into Australia. They went through a period of massive economic growth, which the world is paying for, which had no value to the community in terms of jobs or genuine development.

         During that period this government strutted around telling us about its surpluses. But there has been one consistent factor in the government's performance, be it in delivering budget deficits or surpluses—generally, it has never got it right. It has come along to this parliament and predicted that its budget deficit or surplus would be a certain figure, and the figure has generally been considerably at variance with those predictions. It received a big surprise when it got a lot of money one year, I think it was in 1989-90. It had a budget surplus of about $8 billion generated not through the sorts of developments that this country needs, but through speculated profits.

         Then all of a sudden, from my recollection, for the year 1991-92 the government told us that it thought it could get by with a budget deficit of about $4 billion—which was bad enough but, as the figures in front of me display, it actually had a deficit of $9,339 million. That was the figure produced after the usual types of creative accounting where the government brings into account Reserve Bank profits and all of these things. The Reserve Bank makes massive profits every time the Australian economy is in trouble. It is probably an indicator that we should run—the Reserve Bank profit indicator—as evidence of how badly the country is going. When the bank goes out to defend our dollar and so on—and in the process sell good hard currency securities—it shows a profit in Australian dollars. But it is really a reverse index, and it is one that business should take into account. In other words, Reserve Bank profits are not good news for Australia. In the following year I think it was predicted that we might get by with about a $9 billion budget deficit. But the figures show us that the budget deficit rose to $14,571 million. At one stage it looked like being about $16 billion. We now have the government telling us that it can get by with $16 billion—to be correct, $16.008 billion.

         The simple fact is that this is a disaster. We have the government moralising about the problem here, but offering only one solution. That solution is more taxes. In other words, it is too bad if the Australian people have their own plans for investment; investments that they could make that would produce something for the country. Our international indebtedness has grown dramatically under this government. When the Labor Party achieved office, Australia's international debt was of the order of $36 billion. That is what we owed all the world. Our international debt is now about $209 billion, an increase of 480 per cent. A lot of that debt was contracted by the private sector in the 1980s. In the 1990s, that debt is all the result of government borrowing, be it state or federal.

         It is significant that these budget papers show us that the current account deficit, the increase in Australia's foreign debt, is anticipated to be about $18 billion. We are now debating a bill that suggests the federal government will borrow $16 billion. Were I to have the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) sitting opposite me now, they would tell me that the Commonwealth is not borrowing any money overseas. That is primarily true. They have first crack at the Australian financial markets; they get their money here and send everybody else offshore to borrow it and lend it back to them. It is another example of the silly, juvenile sort of logic that is trotted out in this place day after day.

         Unfortunately, this logic is bought by the media people who make up our press gallery—and I hope some of them are listening. I know that journalists are not generally renowned for their arithmetic skills—they have been trained in another area—but the simple fact is that most of them, I hope, would be able to work out that two plus two equals four, not six. It is totally foolish to suggest that when the government borrows money within Australia it does not have an effect upon our international indebtedness. As I said, there is $16 billion of government borrowing and $18 billion of Australian foreign debt. These figures are almost comparable.

         One of the issues that concern me is that this government repeats, notwithstanding its rhetoric, that it will get this figure down to one per cent of GDP in four or five years—provided that it can tax the Australian people to pay for it!  There is no question of improving the economy or of cutting government expenditure because the nation cannot afford it, and it is downright outrageous to dump our living standards on our kids. That is what we are on about with these sorts of deficits. We say, `What about Asia?'. It became a bit of a joke in this place because government members would jump up and say, `Asia does not have the same sorts of social security arrangements that we have; how can you compare us?'. It is an interesting point. But Asian countries have a few social arrangements that make some of those social security payments unnecessary. For instance, it is the responsibility of young people to look after the elderly. They take it as a family commitment, and maybe there is some sense in that. It is probably too late for Australia.

         Our social security arrangements consume nearly 40 per cent of this budget. Certainly they consume over 30 per cent. I am often at pains to point out to people that this building, with all its beautiful facilities, represents two weeks spending by the Department of Social Security. I do not want people to interpret too much out of that statement, but the simple fact is that under this government the solution to political popularity is to borrow some money—to let the children pay. They do not get a vote yet; the government does not have to worry too much about them.

         It is outrageous for a government to try to justify its electoral popularity and concerns for certain sectors of the community when its only solution to problems is to borrow money or put more taxes on those who are trying to produce. It is even worse when those taxes are applied in the way they have been. If a government really wants to kill the Australian economy, it taxes transport. We are a country of huge distances. Our resources are not all stacked up in one nice little corner where we can go in with a train line and cart them all out. They are spread across the nation. It seems that the more remote the area, the richer the possibility for resources. In that situation, why would a government increase the taxes on transport?

Why would the government put taxes on the most environmentally friendly fuel, namely distillate—diesel, as we often call it—and the diesel engine, when in Europe, in recognition of its environmental friendliness, and irrespective of the prices and the taxes, distillate sells for about half the price of other fuels such as petrol? Furthermore, Europe works on the principle of making the most environmentally friendly fuel the cheapest, not trying to make the least environmentally friendly fuel the dearest by adding further tax. There is a lot of sense in it.

The government put a proposition to Australia that it could balance its budget without all these deficits, manage the expenditure and give people a good standard of living with no extra taxes. That is what it told Australia at the election. Now it is blaming us for wanting to hold in to that promise.

         In the same speech on 24 June the Treasurer called upon the states to face up to political and fiscal realities just like the Commonwealth had done. It was a statement that would have done the artful dodger proud—`just like the Commonwealth had done'. The fact is that the Commonwealth has not shown the same amount of financial stringency in relation to its own purpose outlays as it has forced upon the states.

         We might well believe from the Treasurer's statement that he was leading by example, but the bottom line is that this Treasurer, even in this year alone, proposes to increase Commonwealth expenditure. Even this year the Treasurer proposes to increase the government's deficit. Despite all the sermonising and hectoring in relation to the states, he proposes to actually increase the government's deficit in the forthcoming year.

         At the end of June the Treasurer produced some charts to try to substantiate his ridiculous claims and to attempt to prove the impossible—that the government had a track record of fiscal discipline and would play its part in raising public sector saving. The Treasurer's press release of 27 June, which attempted the impossible, contained no data, omitted important social security and welfare expenditure and could be described as an elaborate statistical con. When we take away the smoke and the mirrors and look at the real figures, there is no hiding the fact that the Commonwealth's own purpose outlays—the spending of the Commonwealth on its own services—has grown, while at the same time the government has been reducing assistance to other levels of government, particularly the state governments.

         Using the Treasurer's own definition of own purpose outlays, which he defined as total government outlays less grants to other levels of government, I put the Treasurer's claims to the test. In the last year of the Fraser government the percentage of Commonwealth own purpose outlays to GDP was 18.9 per cent. In the first year of the Labor government it rose to 19.4 per cent. Using the government's own estimates in relation to GDP, by the end of this financial year it will have grown to 20 per cent. In relation to its own spending, the Commonwealth government has increased it as a proportion of the economy.

They have been slashed from 9.6 per cent of GDP in 1983-84 to 7.3 per cent this financial year. These figures make a mockery of the Treasurer's claim to fiscal discipline. He whips the states but indulges himself. In relation to the states, there is a touch of the sadist; but in relation to himself, there is not a touch of the masochist. The Treasurer's spending cuts are all done at the expense of somebody else.

         I wish to dwell on the most insidious provision in this bill: clause 20. Clause 20 seeks to enforce compulsory student unionism and infringe the rights of students to choose whether or not they wish to join a student union. It seeks to do this by financially penalising those states which allow students the open and honest choice of whether or not they wish to join a student union.

         Across this country students are compelled to pay considerable moneys each year to student unions in order to get an education. It is a classic no ticket, no start.

         Clause 20 of this bill provides the mechanism to enforce that practice. The education minister is able to impose a financial penalty upon those states which institute or allow free choice or voluntary unionism. It works like this: if a state allows students to choose whether or not to join a union, like responsible adults, and they choose not to join a union, the government will nonetheless make up all the fees that the union has lost. It is going to pay those fees across to the educational institutions.

The absolute first charge of this government, when it comes to funding the states, is going to be student unions. That is the government's priority.

The Treasurer was responsible for the greatest centralisation of power ever in tertiary education. Yet, once again, the government sends in the affable but bumbling Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) to read out the same tired old lines written for him by the minister's office to tell us why it is necessary to force all students into student associations and why it is necessary, if they choose not to join, to prop up their income in the name of university autonomy.

It is the fact that a government, which was democratically elected in Western Australia, has decided, in accordance with the principles that it holds dear, that it is going to give freedom of choice in tertiary institutions. That is what has happened. Because it is going to give freedom of choice in relation to tertiary institutions, Labor says, `No; you can't do that in Western Australia.

The less popular a body gets—the fewer members it gets—the bigger subsidy it will get out of the Commonwealth government. That is the way in which the government works it. The fewer students who actually join, the bigger the grant from the federal minister. So the student unions which end up being the least representative will be the most rewarded financially. They will be rewarded with Commonwealth taxpayers' funds. This measure will isolate and marginalise student unions even more. There is now no market discipline. There is no need to attract members any more because there is a guaranteed source of income, courtesy of the federal taxpayer, through the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill.

We could not have students going off to demonstrate in New South Wales on their own money.

It collapsed in 1984 after horrific business failures. The most prominent business failure was the collapse of AUS Student Travel in August 1977, when its creditors took over the company. These are the organisations the income of which the government has to prop up. AUS Student Travel collapsed with debts in the order of $2.5 million.

This is one of the single largest areas of expenditure in the Commonwealth budget and the funds procured form a large part of the funds available to the states. With the grants for general revenue being set at $14.4 billion, it seems that the government has stood by its commitment, made at the 1990 Premiers Conference, to maintain the level of financial assistance to the states in real terms over the three years 1991-92 to 1993-94 inclusive.

         That such restraint is required is a reflection of the marked lack of fiscal restraint by the Commonwealth government in recent years, except when it comes to passing on such restraint to the other levels of government. This Commonwealth Labor government has long been concerned with shifting the burden of fiscal restraint onto the states. The most recent Premiers Conference was no exception. The

The need for increased national savings is being used by Labor to give it new reasons for doing the same thing it has always done, but for which the old justifications are looking a little tired.

         It is certainly true that there is greater room for fiscal restraint on the part of state and territory governments.

         Labor's most recent budget was notable for its complete absence of any expenditure restraint, despite the record high budget deficit and a need to wind back the public sector to make way for economic recovery. The government has instead contented itself with a budget deficit target of around 1.2 per cent of gross domestic product by 1996-97, leaving us with a deficit in that year of about $6 billion. Such a target is quite laughable, and is mocked by Labor's own One Nation statement of February last year, which projected a budget surplus within a similar time frame.

         The government could have avoided a lot of the trouble it has got itself into with its legislation to increase taxes if it had instead lived up to its mandate at the last federal election, which was to deliver personal tax cuts—not raise taxes—and to cut the Commonwealth's own purpose spending. Cutting government spending is never easy; that is acknowledged. But it must surely be starting to look a lot easier than trying to get the budget tax increases through the Senate. So instead of expenditure restraint from the Commonwealth in its own purpose spending, we have seen a host of tax increases being tried on to achieve Labor's paltry deficit reduction target.

         With a preponderance of Liberal state governments, the Commonwealth will have every incentive to shift a large part of this need for fiscal savings onto the states. It is significant that the Commonwealth's three-year guarantee to maintain financial assistance to the states in real terms has just expired. The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) has already been making noises about the need for the states to take the hard decisions. My friend the honourable member for Higgins made reference to that.

         The degree of vertical fiscal imbalance that exists in Commonwealth-state relations has been well documented. The states have an extremely narrow tax base. None of the existing taxes can be increased beyond their present levels without doing serious damage to economic activity in a variety of areas. Of all the federal systems of government in the world, Australia must have the most centralised system of revenue raising and the highest level of vertical fiscal imbalance. If the Commonwealth government wants the states to have an incentive to engage in expenditure restraint, then it has to share the responsibility for public sector revenue raising with the states. Only then will state governments have the appropriate motivation to limit spending and to make a significant contribution to public sector saving in this country.

         In addition to providing general revenue assistance to the states, this bill includes provisions that seek to entrench compulsory student unionism at Australian higher education institutions through federal financial coercion of state governments. The honourable member for Higgins has given a good account of that. In conjunction with amendments to the Higher Education Funding Act that Labor passed last year, this bill will seek to reduce financial assistance to state governments that legislate for freedom of association at universities within state jurisdictions.

         The associated amendments to the Higher Education Funding Act were first introduced by Labor in 1989 in the mistaken belief that the coalition government in New South Wales would legislate to protect the rights of students not to be coerced into associations against their will. Unfortunately, the coalition government in New South Wales was never serious about protecting the rights of students to freedom of association. In fact, the New South Wales government has since used Labor's legislation as an excuse to avoid doing the correct thing by tertiary students in that state.

         What the federal Labor government is proposing to do with this legislation is in fact quite ridiculous. It is surprising that anyone should be fooled by it. The suggestion is that the Commonwealth will step in and give to universities a sum of money equal to the shortfall in collections of student union fees that occurs as a result of the introduction of voluntary membership of these bodies in any given state. The states will then have their general revenue assistance docked by the Commonwealth for an equivalent amount of money. Think of the bureaucracy involved in all of this, apart from anything else.

         —There is untold hardship in woolgrowing rural Australia and, in particular, in specialist or exclusively wool producing areas. It is not just growers themselves who are being devastated by what really must be the lowest real prices for wool in living memory, and perhaps ever; it is entire communities. Service towns wilt and die as farmers close their chequebooks or, worse, have them taken away, just as they face that enormous devastation. The brutal and harsh reality facing the industry, I am afraid, is that prices will remain in the doldrums until the world economy picks up and more people are prepared to buy wool and pay higher prices for it, and until the industry's huge stockpile ceases to overhang the market.

         Currently, depressed world economic conditions are the major price depressant. Once demand starts to pick up, I believe that the stockpile, especially while there is uncertainty about the way it will be handled and managed, will prove to be the greatest inhibitor of what must be the first priority for the industry; that is, price improvements for the growers who, after all, are the foundation stone of the industry. They will not survive any longer in the current scenario in which they find themselves. Frankly, while the stockpile is used to immediately fill gaps between supply and demand—and there is enough wool in the stockpile to fill an awful lot of gaps for an awfully long time—there is little chance of significant price increases.

         The coalition's position is that the model proposed by the Wool Industry Review Committee, set up by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) after the last election, is, on balance, more likely to induce an earlier and stronger recovery in prices, at the same time as it will see a programmed quitting of stocks, than are the current arrangements. Those current arrangements, which centre primarily on an annual debt repayment, seem likely to regularly produce uncertainty and speculation about the possibility of fire sales, for example, as repayments fall due. They certainly seem likely to depress prices and disguise market signals from growers and to result in higher taxes for longer than the alternative put before us tonight.

         We need to keep in mind that the budget itself provided, in the absence of a new and better plan, for a higher tax of 12 per cent—if my memory serves me correctly—in circumstances where the legislation allows for a maximum of 15 per cent. We face a difficult situation, given that some $600 million is due next year—$400 million for debt repayment and $200 million in interest and storage and handling costs—in determining how that is to be met while the industry is in such a dreadful situation.

         Briefly, the package of eight bills before us will reshape the wool industry along the lines recommended by that Wool Industry Review Committee, known as the Garnaut committee. The aim is to reduce the number of bodies dealing with wool down to two. One is for promotion, research and development, and the other, to be known as Wool International, is to pay off the debt and reduce the stockpile by selling a predetermined fixed amount of wool. When the debt is less than the value of the stockpile—the target date is mid-1997; I understand it is only a target date—Wool International will be privatised and will then be owned by the people who have paid the debt taxes in the industry since July of this year. It should be noted at the outset that the legislation relating to a privatised Wool International has not been introduced, and will not be for some time. I know that the industry will want to debate widely that body's potential role and place in the market. That is an appropriate situation given the concerns that many sectors of the industry have raised.

         By way of background, the wool industry reserve price scheme operated for some 20 years before falling into difficulty in the early 1990s due to a combination of factors which led ultimately to its total abandonment in February 1991. Prices for wool at auction increased dramatically in the late 1980s, peaking at around 1100c per kilogram. Instead of keeping the reserve price itself synchronised with the long-term price trend, it was increased by about 60 per cent over two years to 870c a kilogram, where it remained for two seasons. This increase, which effectively converted the reserve price scheme into a price setter, altered the price ratio of wool relative to other fibres. Instead of wool being somewhere around its historical level of three times as dear as cotton, it became six times as dear. This caused the trade to shift to other fibres at about the same time as the world recession started and the old Soviet Union split and ran into financial troubles.

         In 1950-51, the world total production of fibres was around 10 1/2 million kilograms. Wool had around 10 per cent of the total market. Man-made fibres accounted for 16 per cent and cotton 74 per cent. By 1991-92, the total share for wool had slipped to just 4.4 per cent. I think woolgrowers ought to be concerned about and ought to focus closely on a different set of figures from that which is so often quoted to me in the community where they say we ought to have enormous presence in the marketplace and we ought to be able to use that on the basis that we provide 80 per cent of the world's apparel fibre. I would suggest that the figure that needs quite careful focus is that total market share of a world fibre market. It is slipping and is in danger of becoming invisible. New approaches to dealing with this problem need to be put in place.

         That floor price for wool meant that wool was the most profitable farming enterprise with a guaranteed return. Many grain and other farmers started running sheep. We have all heard the tragic stories about graziers who went out and bought more land on the basis that they had a guaranteed income, because the reserve price scheme was there, and who have been horribly caught. Production rose very rapidly to the point where, in the late 1980s, some 1,100 million kilograms were being produced, but that was more than the market could cope with. In 1989-90, the AWC bought almost three million bales, or 52 per cent of the clip. The following year it bought 35 per cent of the clip. The government lowered the floor price to 700c, and in early 1991, as I mentioned earlier, it scrapped it altogether.

         By that time the Australian Wool Corporation had not only spent the $1.8 billion of growers' money that it had in reserve, but also borrowed $2.9 billion, and the stockpile reached the horrifying level, in current circumstances, of 4.5 million bales. At that point the government formed the Australian Wool Realisation Commission, the AWRC, to handle the disposal of the stockpile and to pay off the debt. It was committed to a situation where the government said to growers, `You will pay off the debt but you will cede ownership of the stockpile to the AWRC'.

The 12 months following that, however, saw a significant decline in prices. It became obvious that it was going to be extraordinarily difficult to meet the repayment schedule this year. In fact, during that period of great speculation about what was going to happen and whether there would be a fire sale and so on, there was an all-time low of 381c a kilogram.

Under current arrangements, the almost unlimited volume of stockpile wool which could come onto the market when prices start to rise will dampen not just the rises, but the signals.

The potential for a repetition of the boom-bust cycle that has been such a problem for this industry in the past is very high under current legislation. At the same time, the proposed model starts to quit the stockpile. It does so at a rate of 27,000 to 29,000 bales a month from July to December next year, with a plus or minus five per cent variation allowed in that, and from January 1995 some 33 million kilograms, plus or minus five per cent per quarter.

There will be no investment in wool if people are worried that a lot more wool might be dumped onto the market to meet an arbitrary debt repayment schedule. The coalition recommended in 1991 that we move to a fixed disposal schedule. We moved away from that scenario at that time because of the higher rates of production then applying.

Why has this happened? Consistently high levels of inflation have gutted our competitiveness and put us behind, every time we have gone ahead.

That is how it must be if wool is to be restored to its rightful place as a premier agricultural export of this country.

         —I am very pleased to support what I believe is one of the most important pieces of primary industry legislation that has come into the House for many years. The Wool International Bill and cognate bills will have a marked and positive impact on an industry that has shouldered a great deal of the burden of Australia's economic wellbeing for many decades.

         I commend the coalition and the shadow minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), for the positive steps they have taken to back the legislation. I know that the opposition is raising some questions of detail, as has already been mentioned, but I believe that they are peripheral; they do not go to the substance, impact or focus of this legislation. I understand that consultation is still going on, and I hope that is approached in such a way that the future of the industry is considered. Certainly, in that respect, the consultation so far has been very good.

Those three people, the membership of the Wool Industry Review Committee, have been able to stand at arm's length from the industry and view the problems confronting it as a whole rather than as bits and pieces with difficulties arising out of each of those small parts. In doing that, they have come up with what is known now as the Garnaut report on the wool industry. That report has provided the framework for this legislation.

         I also strongly commend the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) for the understanding, work and clear thinking that he has brought to this particular problem and to the portfolio as a whole. I know that, in the meetings that I have shared with the minister, primary industries organisations and woolgrowers have all been impressed with his great ability to cut to the core of an industry's concerns and, where government action is required, necessary or appropriate, to act quickly and have those concerns addressed. I know that, especially in the early days, opposition members, particularly of the National Party of Australia, hoped that the minister would fail. But with every passing day those opposite cringe a little more as he demonstrates to the rural community that he has the understanding and the ability to get things done that the primary industries need. They are recognising that fact.

         As I have said, this legislation affects what has historically been, and what will continue to be, one of our most important primary industries. While it is true that Australia probably does not ride on the sheep's back any more, there is still truth in the fact that the backbone of the sheep will carry a considerable amount of our economic burden in the future. As we all know, the wool industry is probably just about to emerge from one of the most difficult periods in its history. Low and falling commodity prices, joining with extensive droughts, in some cases floods—as the minister and I saw today in Wangaratta, Shepparton and Benalla—and some ill-conceived management policies forced many farmers into bankruptcy and much of the primary industries sector into deep recession. As a government, we do not have much control over external factors. We do not have much control over droughts, if any, floods or falling commodity prices, but we can have an impact on the internal domestic mechanisms which play such a direct part in influencing the future of the industry.

         Those internal mechanisms are being properly addressed in this legislation. It is all about sending proper signals to our wool producers and to the international markets on which they rely. It has become necessary to do this because the wrong signals have been sent out in the past. By setting an unrealistically high floor price for our wool in the 1980s and early 1990s, the Wool Council of Australia sent out two extremely important but equally damaging signals. The first was to the Australian wool producers. It did not matter how much wool they produced, it was going to fetch a premium price. It seemingly did not matter that wool producers were not selling it to anyone but themselves and that they were having to buy it back and pay interest on the borrowings they needed in order to buy the wool. They were happy to keep producing more and more wool, secure in the knowledge that they would be able to sell it at that high price. That, of course, led to overproduction and an increasing supply of wool that was difficult to sell.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The second signal was to the international market. That signal told the international buyers that if they wanted to get Australian wool they would have to pay 870c a kilogram. That led many to retool and to develop facilities for the processing of the competitive items—the man-made fibres. Once they spent so much of their resources on retooling, it was going to be difficult for them to get back into the wool market. So the farmers were producing all the wool that they could, then buying it back from themselves, while the international clothing manufacturers turned their machinery into making clothes from other fibres. The result was the development of a huge stockpile of wool; and panic set in. The stockpile was seen as an ogre. The overriding feeling was, `Who will pay anything for our wool when they know we have to get rid of this great amount? Buyers will hold out of the market until we are forced to sell it for virtually nothing'.

         The most powerful aspect of the legislation before the House tonight is that it allows the wool industry, and more generally Australia, to view the stockpile of wool not as a liability but as an asset. It lets us see that this great reserve of wool has tremendous value, that it is something no other country in the world is capable of producing and that, if marketed correctly, it will return the industry to long-term viability. That will be achieved primarily through the introduction of a fixed schedule—in other words, a timetable—which will let the international market and the domestic producers know that, regardless of price, a certain amount of Australian wool will come onto the international market at a fixed rate over a fixed time. There will be no fluctuation; a set amount will be sold each year.

         This is an important signal. This is the one that tells prospective buyers that they will not be able to hold off on their purchase for too long because another prospective buyer, one who is equally aware of what is available, might snap up what is on offer in that year. It has been argued by some people in the industry that, while they agree a certain amount of the stockpile should be sold each year, if the price rises significantly they should be able to fill that demand while the price is at a premium. This would create market uncertainty and the question would be: how much over the schedule are they likely to sell?

         If Wool International were to take the opportunity presented by rising prices to sell more wool, this would have a dampening effect on the extent of the price rise and producers would, therefore, lose the benefit of any price upturn. With the passing of this legislation, we will be telling international buyers that from 1 July next year we will have a set amount of wool for sale. It is perhaps fortuitous that in the first year of the operation of the fixed schedule our wool production will have fallen to such a degree that the wool realised through the fixed schedule will simply bring us back to somewhere near the current level of sales. With South Africa and New Zealand also likely to be producing less wool there is likely to be less supply, leading to increased demand and rising prices.

         The three primary objectives of the legislation are: to establish industry bodies with a clear commercial focus; to establish new mechanisms for the marketing of wool; and to expand international trade in wool and wool products. The first of these objectives requires a significant change in approach for the wool industry. In the past it has had what was predominantly a production focus, encouraging industry participants to produce high quality and large quantities of wool, but with little focus on the market requirements for that wool. This strategy links closely with the second and third objectives to establish new mechanisms for marketing wool and to expand the international wool trade. This will largely take the form of generic promotion whereby wool and wool products, rather than particular classes or types of wool, will be promoted.

         As is evident from this package, these are measures which are designed to ensure the long-term viability of the industry. They are measures which will change the signals that have been sent to wool producers and the international community, which will encourage an attitudinal change in the industry from one that is production focused to one that is market focused, and which will treat the wool stockpile as a great natural asset rather than a problem that must be disposed of. They will place the wool industry firmly in the position of master of its own destiny.

         It is important to remember that while this government is focusing on guaranteeing the long-term viability and profitability of the industry, it is not going to let wool producers with good long-term prospects fall by the wayside during the current difficult position. The simple fact is that on current international prices the industry is unsustainable. The long-term prospects, on all available evidence, are good, but many producers are in severe difficulty now and it is essential that they be assisted through this difficult period until commodity prices improve.

         While we are here tonight discussing measures which are aimed at the industry's long-term future, it is important not to lose sight of what we are doing to help those whose need is urgent. In late April this year the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy announced a package of measures to address the existing and long-term issues facing the industry. These measures provided immediate assistance to members of the industry who were in short-term difficulty but had long-term viability prospects.

         As announced by the minister at the time, the key elements of the package to address short-term circumstances were, first, that the federal government would fund up to  $44.6 million under the exceptional circumstance provision of the rural adjustment scheme, which would allow an interest rate subsidy of up to 100 per cent for eligible growers. This followed a recommendation to the government by the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council, a broadly represented body which includes rural representation. The second element is maintenance of the wool tax rate at 8 1/2 per cent for 1993-94, made up of 3 1/2 per cent for wool promotion and marketing, half a per cent for research and development and 4 1/2 per cent for the Australian Wool Realisation Commission. Third, there is the restructuring of the AWRC debt repayment schedule by extending the debt schedule from seven to eight years and introducing  more flexibility  to  the  schedule, including the removal of any requirement for the commission to repay debt in 1993-94 beyond the funds already in hand for this purpose of $118 million. The government has also agreed that annual targets for debt repayment be indicative only, with the actual target to be determined by the government at the start of each financial year.

         The government made the exceptional circumstance funding available immediately to eligible producers and called on the states to provide some matching RAS funding. The minister also announced that the cap on the level of assistance for each applicant under the provisions would be lifted from $30,000 to $50,000, with further changes being subject to a review of RAS administrative arrangements. Increased flexibility was also provided for those eligible for exceptional circumstance provisions.

         It is clear that the government is focusing on the long-term and the short-term prospects for the Australian wool producer. It is focusing on the long-term prospects by implementing the appropriate policy settings, but will keep farmers with prospects for long-term viability operational by providing short-term assistance. By doing this, it will be able to keep those with an understanding and a knowledge of the industry, those who have a commitment to its future and their future within it, involved. We will not be losing one of our most precious resources in the wool industry, namely, the human resource.

         I mentioned at the outset that I was encouraged by the support this legislation had received from the opposition, government members and other interested parties. I would like to conclude by giving credit to the vast majority of the wool industry which has supported this legislation. It is often difficult when faced with a crisis to see things clearly, and there is no doubt that the wool industry is currently in crisis. But it has been able to recognise the many positive aspects of this legislation and generally has offered very strong support for the focus and substance of the legislation.

         Concern has been expressed by the Wool Council and more lately by the New South Wales Farmers Association that they will not be represented on the board of the Australian Wool Research and Development Corporation. After giving support to the Garnaut report, the New South Wales Farmers Association is now suggesting that it might approach the Democrats and the Greens in the Senate in order to force amendments to the legislation to require compulsory membership on the board. The argument is that, if growers are to be paying a four per cent levy for promotion and marketing, they should have a say in how that money is spent.

         The answer is that they will. Of the nine-person board, there will be a chairperson, a deputy chairperson, a government appointee appointed by the minister and six others. The minister has given assurances that the industry will be thoroughly consulted before any appointments are made. It is also a requirement for the remaining six members of the board that they have skills or qualifications in the following areas: production or processing, business management and finance, research and development and product promotion. These board members should have expertise in at least one of these areas and some skills in each of the other areas.

         I would like to make a couple of points. This legislation is about setting a clear direction for the Australian wool industry. It is a direction which will put it on a stable footing and will allow it once again to be one of Australia's predominant primary industries. It is a long-term process and, while we are getting there, this government will not abandon those woolgrowers who have demonstrated commitment to the industry and an ability to become profitable. It is well-reasoned legislation based on expert advice and wide ranging discussion and consultation with the government, the industry and individual growers.

I believe that we should view the wool industry not as part of our problems but as an important part of the solutions to this nation. It deserves our full support. I commend the bill to the House.

         —I am delighted that the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) in his final remark is optimistic about the future of the wool industry. I am pleased that a member of the government has that attitude. From the outset, I declare my interest in the wool industry, having been a woolgrower all my life. I have watched these arguments since 1965 when the woolgrowers actually rejected the reserve price scheme, which was subsequently introduced in 1972. In October 1993 we are introducing legislation that clears up the mess, so to speak.

         We have a massive $2.2 billion of debts and we have about 3.9 million bales in the stockpile. They are the fundamental problems that face the wool industry.

         It is worth looking at some of the historical perspectives of how we actually got into this mess. The reserve price peaked in the 1980s when the wool price reached 1100c clean. The reserve price at that time was increased by 60 per cent to 870c. That was at a time when the wool industry was booming and everyone was optimistic. I well recall wool industry leaders saying, `This will go on forever'. Those of us who had been in the industry were very sceptical that these very high prices would continue and thought that the setting of this reserve price at such a high level was fraught with danger and in the long term would be the undoing of the industry. And so it happened.

         The security blanket that was put there by the reserve price encouraged woolgrowers to produce 5.7 million bales of wool in 1989-90. At that stage, the Australian Wool Corporation brought in three million bales of that clip—about 50 per cent—because of the reserve price. That was the seed of destruction of the whole program and the whole reserve price arrangements.

The debts had become too great, and the results are there for everyone to see. The growers had spent $1.8 billion of their own funds that had been carefully conserved over the years.

         We have these two problems. We have a stockpile of physical product in wool bales and we have a debt. I would like to concentrate on those two aspects here in the parliament. The Vines report recommended that in view of this basic problem a wool realisation commission should be set in place. At that time, it was agreed in the wool industry that there be a repayment schedule to try to remove this debt and remove the physical stockpile overhanging the market. Over the seven-year period, as members would fully understand, there was a schedule to remove the debt in the first year of $300 million, with a sliding scale up to $600 million, with no debt being left in 1997-98. That was the program that the Vines committee recommended. In recent times, that has run into a number of difficulties.

         The key issue involved in this whole proposition was that the government demanded that there be a repayment in monetary terms for all the debt that had been incurred for which the government had given a guarantee. So when things got tough more wool was being sold just to meet those monetary targets. With the depressed price that is now operating down as low as 380c on the indicator, these schedules were almost impossible to meet. The government could see that there was a possibility of a fire sale. The market fell even further and it was obvious that we had to take some further actions. That necessitated some recommendations from the Garnaut committee. We have the result of that in the legislation here today.

         I do have reservations. These recommendations have emerged rapidly. There has not been a very full debate on some of the ramifications of the Garnaut recommendations. However, it is a positive option put forward by the government and I would like to make some observations. We do have the physical stockpile of 3.9 billion bales; we do have the $2.2 billion of debt—which is guaranteed by the government—but let us not forget that that money has been borrowed from the private sector and it is serviced by woolgrower funds. I think sometimes it is overlooked in this debate that the Australian woolgrowers are now servicing this debt—which was incurred by previous woolgrowers—and are servicing it with the government guarantee.

         Let me just deal briefly with the reorganisational aspects of the legislation that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) has put down. We see some changes yet again. Those of us who have been in the wool industry wonder what will be the next set of changes in terms of the promotion and research. The shadow minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), has dealt with the details of that. We had a recommendation of the Vines committee to split the organisations and now we have a recommendation to put the promotion and research together. I support that general approach and the levies of 0.5 per cent for research and 3.5 per cent for promotion. I note that the government has withdrawn its $20 million from these activities at a time when the wool industry could well do with the government's support. Hopefully, these structures will remain in place. They will fulfil a role which historically they have done well. Promotion and research over the years in the wool industry have been effective. There has always been an argument as to whether the promotion has been value for money but I think over the 20 years that promotion has been very much a feature of the wool industry. Woolgrowers have managed to maintain their market share or their particular niche in the fibre market and they have been able to promote wool around the world and generally within the market circumstances.

         I turn to the formation of Wool International. Obviously, this is a key part of the government's legislation and the recommendations of the Garnaut committee. I am interested to observe that Wool International will be a statutory body with a set of directors under the Corporations Law. One of the ironic twists is that because the equity of Wool International will not be there in the first couple of years trading a liquidator will have to be appointed to run its affairs. That is an interesting way to set up an authority—to have a liquidator supervising its affairs because there is no equity in the outfit.

         Wool International is enjoying the support of government guarantee for its operations in its early years. The minister has indicated that he wishes to privatise this operation in 1997. I would go along with that particular approach. Hopefully, the mechanics of the process of change will be acceptable to woolgrowers and to the government, the operation will be privatised, and the equity will flow to woolgrowers in the method outlined by the minister.

         This whole operation of Wool International begins on 1 July 1994, which is at the end of the wool selling season. I do wonder what might actually happen over the next few months when a big proportion of the Australian wool clip will be sold.

         Happily, Wool International is now under the up-front regime of a monthly and quarterly disposal schedule for selling wool. This is clear to both the wool buying and wool selling fraternity. The conceptual basis is that we have a physical stockpile of 3.8 million bales. The conceptual approach, to put it in simple terms, is that the stockpile is like a big sheep station in Queensland. Wool International and the government have determined that there will be a steady flow of wool onto the market on the predictable basis of 27,000 to 29,000 bales from July 1994 to December 1994. I find some difficulty in establishing exactly how the figure of 27,000 bales was arrived at. However, from January 1995 to June 1997, there is a clear determination to put 46,700 bales per month onto the market—a total of 561,000 bales per year; about half a million bales per year on the physical disposal schedule. That is the key argument to which I will allude a little later.

         Woolgrowers are concerned to know their equity in the stockpile at the end of this program; whether there will be an upside or a downside and who will handle whatever the case may be in 1997. A lot of these arguments are based on the interesting figures that last year Australia sold 4.1 million bales. Production was 3.5 million bales last year, and wool production is falling around the world. Given that seasonal conditions in Australia, especially in Queensland, have been bad, and given that sheep numbers have dropped dramatically because of the profitability of the industry, these figures help support the total proposition.

         The Garnaut schedule for selling this number of bales fits in with the fundamental proposition of the productive potential of the industry and future trends over the next couple of years. The fundamental question is whether that Queensland sheep station—the stockpile—will feed the wool onto the market at a high price or at a low price if the market changes dramatically. For example, I ask honourable members to consider whether, if the price doubled, Wool International would be tempted to put more wool onto the market. If the price fell even further, what would Wool International do with its physical release schedule?

I notice that the former Minister for Primary Industries, the honourable member for Werriwa, is in the chamber. He gave an immutable undertaking that the Australian wool industry would maintain 700c, and we know what happened to that.

         One part of the Garnaut proposals that I do like is the thesis that futures options and physical delivery should be developed in the marketplace. The introduction of the reserve price removed the futures operation. It has been one of my strong recommendations that a futures operation would be very helpful to the Australian wool market and Australian woolgrowers. I was pleased to note that in his second reading speech the minister said, `Between now and July 1994 the government expects Wool International to make significant progress in setting up forward selling mechanisms for the industry'.

         I entirely support the minister when he says that a futures operation should be set up and encouraged. As happens with commodities in other industries, futures markets operate with exchange rates and hedge a position at some future time. Futures give the processor—the grower—a known price at the time of sale. Amongst woolgrowers there is a fear of the operation of futures and, in many cases, a lack of understanding that futures establish a price. Futures in the private marketplace can provide a stabilisation of prices that the reserve price never could.

         The Garnaut report and the recommendations of the government are very much dependent upon increasing world demand for textiles—for wool in particular. We all know that the world is in recession, and textiles are particularly affected. The wool industry will depend upon a resurgence in buying by China, Japan, western Europe, and some of the eastern European mills. At this stage there is no indication that this will take place. An increasing demand for fibre, in particular wool, is a fundamental assumption in all the proposals put forward by the government and the minister.

         The final version of the minimum reserve price scheme for wool was introduced by Ken Wriedt, as minister for primary industry in the Whitlam government. Paradoxically, almost immediately it was sabotaged by the Whitlam cabinet when an increased rate of buying in started to occur. I remember very well arguing against the cabinet's view in the Labor caucus. My friend Bob Whan, the then member for Eden-Monaro, and I were successful in dissuading the government from acting in the way that it intended. Not long after caucus took that decision, Doug Anthony went out to the slathering hordes and the media and took the credit. So I well remember that.

         The minimum reserve price scheme for wool worked well and withstood two periods of buying into the stockpile. But the changes that put the scheme and the industry into threat were really the 1983 decision to float the Australian dollar, worldwide financial deregulation through the 1980s and my decision to allow the Australian Wool Corporation board to set the minimum reserve price in consultation with the industry.

It is a matter of conjecture whether I, as then minister, would have set the price lower than 870c, having taken the price up by 70 per cent over two seasons in the heady days of 1987, 1988 and 1989. There were many at that time who believed that the price of wool had reached, to quote a phrase that was bouncing around the industry, a new plateau.

I have had the view since I became involved in the wool industry professionally in 1971 that insufficient attention has always been paid by the industry and by industry analysts to the requirements of the buyers, the markets and the dynamics of the textile industry.

         For woolgrowers there had not been much profit in wool year in and year out through the 1970s and 1980s. But, with the price hike in the late 1980s, the 870c minimum reserve price, a run of reasonable seasons and the price pressure on wheat and grain growers due to international subsidisation, the sheep flock expanded rapidly and many new entrants came into wool production. This, together with factors such as warm northern winters, consumer response to the previous higher price, the collapse of European communism, changes in the structure of the wool processing and textile industries, the Gulf War, and the onset of world recession meant that supply and demand were getting even more out of balance.

         The ethos of the industry at this time generally was an implicit belief in the virtues of wool, particularly fine wool, and a belief that we had been through all this before and that the minimum reserve price was our saviour and guide in a time of trouble.

         One of the virtues of the minimum reserve price was that it limited risk for buyers of wool for processing. This in turn meant that, in a period of lack of demand, Australian growers through the minimum reserve price scheme carried the risk not only for buyers and users of Australian wool but also for other countries producing apparel wool, such as South Africa, Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand. Although the using industry had coped with the decline in the market price from 1257c a kilogram clean in April 1988—that was the peak—down to the guaranteed price of 870c a kilogram, the majority of the growers and others in the industry were clearly opposed to any drop below the minimum reserve price.

But this argument was transformed by some to say that price and supply and supply and demand never count. People were forgetting that the demand for wool is a derived demand; that wool is a small proportion of total world textile fibre usage, but not, of course, for some products; that the price of competitive fibres really does count; that wool could only extract a price premium up to three times, not eight times, more expensive than its competitors; and also that the developing markets were and are price sensitive.

It is a matter of historical record that the Australian Wool Corporation board was not prepared to accept the drop, nor was the industry generally.

         The question of a fixed or non-fixed schedule release from the stockpile was discussed at length in 1991. On balance, it was the industry view that release be as flexible as possible and out of the hands of government. The reason why the AWIC was set up at that time was to try to demonstrate to the growers and their organisations that there were other stakeholders in the industry who had a lot of knowledge of the industry, and that their ownership of the Australian Wool Corporation was insufficient. While the benefits of a fixed schedule can be overemphasised, I accept the logic of the Wool Industry Review Committee that effective development of forward risk management mechanisms will not occur as long as the flexible debt schedule remains.

The industry always resisted research and development being at arm's length from, but closely linked to, the Australian Wool Corporation. The reason why we previously separated R&amp;D from marketing and the other functions of the AWC was that half R&amp;D funds came from the Australian taxpayer, research and development funds were in effect not being subject to competitive forces, and there was an assumption by regular users of the funds that the funds were available forever. Pet projects of directors became their playthings and there was a disinclination to give up some production directed projects or look to marketing and innovation.

The processing and wool textile industry has been moving to Asia gradually and the Australian Wool Corporation and the industry have been adopting a strategic approach, particularly to the development of the Chinese market. The wool initiative, the Australian China agricultural cooperation agreement, ACIAR—the Australian Council for International Agricultural Research—the sale of genetic material, and the constant work put into advising on methods of buying by the Chinese and the lowering of their tariffs, are gradually having their effect.

But, as I have been intent on emphasising, the most important thing about the Garnaut report and the government's response to it is its majority backing by the Australian wool industry, in all its parts, and the way that they have finally realised that here is an industry in which Australia will also have a comparative advantage. We can always maintain our share of world textile markets if we use our heads and do not stop thinking.

         What the government has done in this instance is to give the industry the chance, by setting up some new structures, to be clearly targeted to a stock run-down, to the market and towards a future which I believe will be bright once we get through this period of industry disability in terms of prices. I believe this will be seen as a very important step in the history of the industry and that the industry will come out of this period in a very strong shape indeed. I commend the bills to the House.

         —I am pleased to speak on the Wool International Bill and cognate bills. I was interested to hear the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) comment—I suppose, flatteringly—about what benefits these bills will bring to the wool industry. I happen to have in front of me a speech he made in this House on 30 May 1991 when he introduced a series of structures in which he said, `The government has decided on the structures appropriate to take us into the next century'. He is here tonight praising a new set of structures—the third we have had in trying to solve this desperate situation.

         I want to declare my interest in this great industry. The economic textbooks on this industry will be rewritten because all of us who have been involved in this industry—with no excuse—abused the floor price scheme and decided to ramp the price with the acquiescence of the government in power at the time. This occurred during the time of the previous minister for primary industries. We went from a floor price of 460c in 1984 to 870c in three years.

The minister should make sure he is right when he starts to make those sorts of statements. We wrecked the industry by ramping the price—the woolgrowers, the government and the parliament. It is no good people walking away and coming up here with excuses that they were not involved in it; we were all involved in it if we did not stand up and say that the scheme was wrong. I have said that many times in this place. At the same time, the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was responsible for an interest regime which has probably broken more woolgrowers than the fall in the reserve price scheme.

         —We got rid of 11 million sheep. We got rid of the next 25 million sheep right on the price of wool. If that scheme had gone ahead in the next three or four months we would not have had the overproduction that this minister was complaining about last April. The minister stood up and said that we had too much production. We do not have it any more because we are now down to 690 million kilograms. We are down to that figure because of one single reason: the price has been so rotten, the seasons have not been too good, and people are moving out of wool. It is quite easy; if we do not put the fertiliser on, we grow fewer sheep.

         —Two reasons. It is one Western Australian reason. The former minister, the honourable member for Werriwa, walked away from that scheme. That was a great tragedy because we could have sold more wool out of the stockpile at that time. With regard to the financial aspects of this scheme, there are two very good reasons why I have absolutely no conscience about the government picking up whatever debt is left. I might say that there is no reason whatsoever for the woolgrowers to think that they should not pay the debt off. In 1984 the government walked away from the IED scheme so that the $6 billion that came into the wool industry for two years in a row was not able to be put aside for hard times, as had been done previously. The government brought the IED scheme back on 1 July 1990, just after those two good years of wool had disappeared, so it picked up the income tax.

         The second reason is that the reserve price scheme itself topped up the price of wool from what the market price would otherwise have been. The scheme was as follows: money was borrowed from the bank; the growers were paid more than the market price; and the growers took the money and paid income tax. My calculation is that somewhere between $500 million and $700 million was paid to the government in grower income tax in two years. The AWC borrowed the money. It paid it to the growers, topped it up, and the net beneficiary was the federal government. Up until now, the government is the only net beneficiary of the last two years of the reserve price scheme.

         As I have said before, those schemes—the 870c, and subsequently the 700c—were agreed to by this parliament. When we dropped the reserve price in this parliament, with the agreement of both sides, from 870c to 700c, we made a vital mistake because we added to the debt and to the stockpile. That is the point from which we are trying to get back. There were wool processors in this country at that time who said, `Don't do it. If you are going to walk away from the scheme, you have to walk right away from the scheme'. They were right, as it turned out. We could not hold the 700c because the world processing and buying trade did not believe us. Apart from that, we know the problems that were developing in eastern Europe and Russia, and that there was a world recession.

         There are two main aspects of these bills which I would like to speak about. There are some very positive aspects of the Garnaut report. There is a great desire in the Garnaut report—which led to these bills—to try to create a market in financial instruments. Whether it is in the futures, in options or in wool bonds, one of its main purposes—and I commend the committee for it—is to try to get the commodity insurance market moving. A great drawback, a result of the reserve price scheme, has been that as the reserve price smoothed out the fluctuations in price, as it did for many years, then there is no reason for people to take positions as they can more or less forecast what the price of wool will be. Even if they cannot, futures markets rely on violent fluctuations, or fluctuations in the price.

We on this side of the House—including the shadow minister, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd)—disapproved and said there were too many bodies. It is nice to see that the government has decided to bring them back to a sensible number.

         There are a couple of matters on which I would like to comment and the first relates to Wool International. I do not believe that Wool International will be much of a problem for the industry for the first two or three years. After that, it probably will not be much of a problem at all because I doubt whether it will last for very long. I cannot imagine any organisation lasting too long when it is expected to profit in the long term by buying wool, placing it around the world, and getting that placement right. I do not believe that the old concept we had of holding a stock of wool in a permanent sense has any merit whatsoever. It has been looked at many times before and the problem with it is that, if we want to hold a permanent barrier or stockpile of wool, whether it be one million or two million bales, against market fluctuations, at some point at least some of it has to be sold and then bought back. The fact of the matter is that we could never have that theoretically permanent barrier that people talk about.

         I believe that Wool International will have its time. It will run for a while but in the end its purposes could well have been perpetrated in earlier times by other firms had those same purposes had greater financial merit. After all, as it will be a corporation bent on earning profits, other people could have done that just as well years ago. And since that could have been perpetrated just as well in the past, one might well ask why it was not done. The fact is that the Wool Corporation did carry out some aspects of this plan and placed wool around the world. One of the problems it found was that it sometimes had it in the wrong place. I imagine that that is a human failing which we may well see repeated in the future. So I have not worried too much about Wool International because I think it will solve itself.

         There has been much discussion about fixed release of the stockpile, although not nearly as much as there should have been because of the time limits that have been imposed on this whole matter. Presumably because the minister for primary industries has to go to Europe, these bills came into this place last Thursday night with almost indecent haste. Discussion prior to that had been on the Garnaut report. All of a sudden, one week later, we are debating, finalising and voting on these bills.

I know that members of the government will stand up here, as the honourable member for Werriwa just did, and say what a wonderful scheme it is. The honourable member said exactly the same thing about the previous scheme. I want to make one particular comment about it, and I think Mr Garnaut himself would agree with it.

         In Argentina, wool supply is down from 200 million kilograms to 90 million; in South Africa, it is down from 100 million kilograms to 65 million; in Australia, it is down from 1,000 million kilograms to 690 million. If it is true that the supply of wool has come down to that extent, and we can therefore implement a fixed release scheme after 1 July 1994, as suggested and indeed required by these bills—if that is a reasonable proposition, it is also reasonable to suggest that wool was going to go out of stockpile in any case. That would appear to be totally logical. My guess is that we will see wool go out of stockpile at some later stage of this financial year.

         As Mr Garnaut said, as recently as yesterday, the fixed release scheme is based on the fact that the current annual production around the world is down to the point where a fixed release has a chance to work. If there is a shortcoming in this scheme it is that, if the price of wool really starts to move up, there is no facility to sell into a rising price market. What really worries me is that half the wool stockpile will still be there in four years from 1 July this year.

         I understand the purpose of the fixed release scheme is to bring out part of the stockpile, sell it and make it part of current production. Buyers will then know more or less what is coming onto the market and that will enable the financial instruments to commence operation. My own guess is that the sooner we get down to half the current stockpile—that is, under two million bales; a psychologically correct amount because we have gotten rid of that number of bales three times since the war—then the quicker all those financial markets will start to work and the quicker the buying and processing trade around the world will start to operate in a free market sense. We have not been able to obtain any figures on what would have happened had this fixed release scheme been brought into operation in the last couple of years. One could bet, however, that it would not have been too good.

Either the PM&amp;C will not let it out, or the Attorney-General's Department will not release it. We have rung eight times since 10 September 1993, the last time being this morning, to ask for this information but it has been held up by the man who was sitting at this table not so long ago, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy.

         Like everything else, we are into phase 3 of the tragic saga of the wool industry. I can only conclude my remarks by saying that the sooner we can get down to a figure of 1.6 million or 1.7 million bales in the stockpile, the greater will be the move to a normal market again because that psychological barrier will have been broken. I only hope that in the end this government does not become so rigid in the release of the stockpile that if some new use or even some new geographical area opens up, that is not taken into account in the amount of wool that is released.

         —I will not speak for long on the Wool International Bill and cognate bills due to time pressures, but I just want to get on the record that we have had a catastrophe in the wool industry and are slowly working our way out of it. It should be clearly understood by the people of Australia that this catastrophe was not just the fault of woolgrowers. In many cases they are innocent parties. I agree with one of the things the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) said, that there is no doubt that the government and opposition bear a large share of that blame.

         There is no doubt that when the previous Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), went to Roma the figures available from ABARE indicated that the price had turned. He allowed the Australian Wool Corporation to put the price to 850c when it was clear that the price was on the way down. We should bear in mind, however, that some people in the Wool Corporation wanted to put it at 1000c. The minister told me at the time that he had given autonomy to the Australian Wool Council and did not want to rescind its first decision, although he knew it was wrong. I believe that the minister should have clearly dissociated himself from that decision. That he did not says something about the loyalty of the former minister—probably loyalty to a fault.

I want to praise the former minister because he has shown an enormous amount of courage. There is no doubt that the implementation of the Garnaut report will depend virtually entirely on the quality of people appointed to that board. It is clearly in the court of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) as to who those people will be. If it fails, the minister understands he will have to wear it. If he is silly enough—I am sure he will not be—to allow onto these boards the recycled people from the Wool Corporation who were there in the past, we are doomed. If this thing is to work at all, it will be management alone that drives it.

         I am no great fan of Garnaut. Very few people have wreaked the damage on this economy that he and his doctrine of the north-east Asian ascendancy and the level playing field have done. The minister has removed the excesses of Garnaut in this legislation, principally by limiting the ability of Wool International to trade while it is a government entity. When it ceases to be a government entity, it will be governed by the fact that it can go broke. If it does not perform, it will fail and that, undoubtedly, will be a good thing.

         I believe that the 4 1/2 per cent tax on growers is an enormous impost. It is a front-end tax on their income. I would not like a 4 1/2 per cent reduction in my take-home pay—nor would my bank manager. This is a very substantial tax. The sooner it can be lifted the better. The honourable member for Barker, in his rather churlish speech—I am sure he will not mind my saying that—seemed to be trying to have it both ways. He lambasts the proposal and talks about the dangers of having a fixed release from the stockpile. He also talked about the need to develop an in-depth futures and options market. There is no doubt that we do need depth in that market. But there cannot be depth if there is any uncertainty about releasing the stockpile. That is simply fundamental.

We certainly cannot do it if we go down the opposition road of indiscriminate releases. Let us look at the consequences. If there is a sudden demand for wool and we are limited to a set release from the stockpile, what will happen? The price of wool will rise. Would that be such a bad thing for growers?

         The concept of the need for security and stability has been around for many years. There is some truth in this. But growers need stability of income, not stability of price. The way to get stability of income is through the futures mechanisms. I concede that those opposite have a very valid point on the IEDs. This minister fought tenaciously against a lot of opposition to get the IEDs reduced. They were taken off initially because they were so rortable. That is what made them vulnerable. He fought to get them back in. Those opposite ought to have enough decency to give the minister credit for that, because the IEDs are very valuable tools for farmers.

         This is the problem in America. It has the view that wool is a prickly, unfriendly fibre. This has hindered every effort to get our wool into potentially the largest wool fibre market. Had we concentrated on Australian wool promotion, we would have been much better off. This was brought home to me in China when I was in a store that sold to Chinese people. I was looking for mohair, but the store had very high quality woollen jumpers made in mills on the Scottish-English border. I said to the girl, who spoke excellent English, `This would be all-Australian wool?'. She said, `No, we use only the best British wool'. She produced the garment for me and it was clearly labelled, `Best Botany Wool, Made in England'. Those mills were selling on quality and they did not use the woolmark. If we asked them why they did not use the woolmark, they would say that woolmark goes on some awful rubbish.

         One of the things we should be using research and development funds for is education of growers. Growers have been kept totally ignorant of their industry. The average wheat grower or cotton grower has always known more about his industry than the average woolgrower. Woolgrowers have been fed nonsense by the Wool Corporation, which they have paid for. It cannot be said too often that what the Wool Corporation did to this nation is at least two Alan Bonds worth of damage. Unfortunately, retribution will catch up with Alan Bond. But we are likely to find that the clowns in the Wool Corporation and the Wool Council will get the Order of Australia. That is usually the way of things.

But the wool industry has been changed irrevocably by what has happened recently. We will see new ideas and innovations in this industry which no-one will be able to stop. We will see a spread of information to growers; there will never be the same level of ignorance.

         Developments will change marketing for the future and for the better. Australia will be a very large producer of tops, the premier top producing nation in the world. Japan, Europe and China will come here for wool tops. It will make wool the most valuable export commodity we have. It will return wool to its position as our biggest export earner. Wool is already our most important industry because it is our most diversified. The wool industry is the biggest small business in Australia. We are going to see employment increase in country areas due to advances in processing wool. This will increase the voting power of wool. I am very pleased to see it and I hope that this new voting power will be more educated than it has been in the past.

         —I would like to start off my contribution to this debate tonight on the Wool International Bill and cognate bills by offering a few bouquets. The first one goes to Professor Ross Garnaut, Stephen Bennett and Rod Price for doing a mighty job in a short period. It was a very wide ranging inquiry which, under difficult circumstances, came up with a pretty fair recommendation. I think the only regrettable part is that, since the wool legislation was brought into the parliament late last week, we have had virtually no time to study such an important piece of legislation because I hear that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) wants to get it through before he goes overseas. It would have been far preferable to have had another couple of weeks to study this legislation in detail. I think the woolgrowers themselves deserve at least a month or two to look at it. Anyhow, that is the situation.

It has the unanimous support of the Wool Council of Australia.

I think he held 23 major meetings around Australia, plus numerous other smaller ones. He did an absolutely herculean job and no praise is too great for what he did in trying to explain the Garnaut report to growers and ascertain their opinions. All woolgrowers owe a debt to the shadow minister for what he has done over the last month.

         There are a lot of critics of the Garnaut report, as we would expect. We are all critics to some extent. I have been quite concerned about the level of sales—four years down the track and we still have almost half the stockpile.

They usually put up no alternative and, if they do, it is usually very thin in detail; or they may have disregarded some critical factor, such as the debt repayment schedule. I notice that the wool exporters, in particular, fall into the category of wanting to have the Wool Realisation Commission stay as it is. I will explain in a minute why that cannot be.

         The wool industry, as we know, is in a parlous state at this stage, even though the outlook may be good. As a member who represents 40 per cent of New South Wales, and nearly all the western division of New South Wales, I am only too aware  of that fact. Many of my woolgrowers live in very remote areas. They have no choice but to derive an income from wool. Considering that less than 18 per cent of the woolgrowers of Australia produce more than 100 bales, there must be a fair slab of those growers in my electorate.

         We are in the position today where we have 3.9 million bales in the stockpile, which is down from 4 1/2 million bales two years ago. If we think back to the time of the reserve price scheme, we will remember that there were only four years—between 1974-75 and 1976-77—when the stockpile exceeded one million bales. We had 1.6 million bales, 1.3 million bales and 1.1 million bales respectively in the stockpile. For a brief period in 1983-84, the stockpile got up to 1.2 million bales. The amount we now have is historically high.

         If this legislation does not go through, this is what will be hanging over our heads: under the debt repayment schedule, growers will have to pay back $400 million next year, rising to $500 million the year after, and then going up to $550 million for each year until it is paid off. On top of that, next year they will have holding costs—intra-storage, handling and other costs—of about $200 million. That is a total of $600 million that the growers will have to find next year. At the moment, wool is making only about $500 a greasy bale, which means that woolgrowers will have to sell 1.2 million bales to meet that dollar debt schedule. The buyers know that and, as the time ticks on to 1 July next year, they will start to hold back, uncertainty will rise in the marketplace and we will probably, because of a falling price, have to sell considerably more bales than we anticipated. If we did not sell any bales, the alternative would be to shove the debt repayment tax component alone up to 24 per cent, which would be absolutely intolerable.

         I think Garnaut's recommendation that the debt repayment schedule, as structured by this government, be abandoned is the No. 1 recommendation that we should all embrace.

         Last year we produced and sold 820 kilotonnes of wool—that is about 4.7 million bales. This coming year we will be producing about 690 kilotonnes of wool—and that amount is falling—which is about four million bales. The amount we got rid of last year was moderately above the historic average. Back in 1989-90, we produced 1,030 kilotonnes, which is about 5.9 million bales. So the difference between what we are expecting to produce next year and what we sold last year is about 130 kilotonnes of wool, and that gives us somewhere to move. The Garnaut requirements have brought down a recommended schedule. I am the first to admit that, if this wool stockpile and debt were privately owned, we would probably handle things much differently. We would probably get rid of it a lot quicker—I would if I were in that situation. However, the wool stockpile is publicly owned and we are restricted in the ways we can move.

         Garnaut says, and it is in the legislation, that next year, 1993-94, for six months we should sell an average of 28,400 bales a month—plus or minus five per cent tolerance—which will amount to 170,400 bales. Then for the next six months that will step up to an average of 46,750 bales a month, which will amount to 280,500 bales in that six-month period. That gives a total for the 12 months of 450,900 bales, which is something just shy of 80 kilotonnes of wool. If we add the 80 kilotonnes to the 690 kilotonnes that growers will be producing in new shorn wool, that comes to only 770 kilotonnes of wool—or 50 kilotonnes less than we sold last year. So we will not be flooding the market with wool, and I think that is a very critical point.

That is 561,000 bales a year, or something just short of 100 kilotonnes of wool. When we add this amount to the 690 kilotonnes, it comes to a total of 790 kilotonnes of wool. I think Garnaut has pitched those levels very cleverly indeed. We will have to off-load something like 4.4 million to 4.5 million bales a year.

         I know some people are concerned—I have some concerns myself—about what will happen if demand suddenly takes off, as is quite possible, and we do not have enough wool to meet the market. The first thing that will happen is the price will be driven higher. Some people are concerned that it will drive the price through the roof, the ratio of the price of wool to other textiles, such as synthetics and cotton, will get out of kilter again and we will lose more market share.

         I do not think it will happen to that extent, but I remind those people who have that concern that since 1950 for more than 50 per cent of the time we have sold less wool than we are proposing to sell over the next four years, and the world has lived with that. Of course, if the price rises, that sends an immediate signal to the growers to start producing more. We have learnt that, despite the lag periods in the industry, growers can respond very smartly, short of a national drought. We have masked these sorts of signals, and we are still doing that at present. If the price starts creeping up, wool starts coming out of the stockpile onto the market. This creates uncertainty and the price usually stagnates.

         The stockpile overhangs the market and we must start to get rid of it for many reasons including, of course, to pay off the debt. While we have such a vast stockpile, we have this glut mentality. It psychologically depresses the market. Buyers will not fill their pipeline to the extent that they should. It is a very comfortable arrangement for the buyers because they know that if they are short at any time they can go to the stockpile and top up.

         There is a constant uncertainty about the market. Buyers would be foolish to top up because if the market slumped they would be caught with expensive wool vis-a-vis their competitors in the industry, so they do not do that. As I have said, every time the market rises, wool comes out of the stockpile and it dampens the price rise. Buyers are never sure how much will come out of the stockpile. That is why it dampens the price rise to the extent that it does.

         The existence of the stockpile and the previous reserve price scheme killed off almost entirely risk management systems across the world as far as wool was concerned. We have had virtually no future trading at all. If we can get to a situation where risk management mechanisms come into place, speculative investment will come into the industry. I welcome this because the wool industry desperately needs that money to be invested in it. That is a point not to be overlooked. Some people would shy away from speculative money coming into the wool industry. I take the opposite point of view and say that it is desperately needed to get a healthy wool industry going.

         While the stockpile sits there it is chewing up growers' money because it costs around $60 per bale per year to store. That runs into something over $200 million, which in itself is equivalent to an eight per cent tax on growers. They cannot keep that up forever. At the moment growers are wearing the costs of holding all the stocks, and at the same time are taking all the risks in the wool industry. That should be spread throughout all sectors of the industry—buyers, processors and growers.

If we had the industrial relations system that New Zealand has, we would save our growers about $100 million. With on-costs, superannuation, workers compensation, et cetera, it costs us about $1.68 just to shear a sheep and 62c to crutch a sheep. In New Zealand, before the on-costs, which are less than ours, it costs about 60c to shear a sheep and about 30c to crutch a sheep. There is room for movement in that direction.

         The Wool International Bill is a commonsense bill. It provides the blueprint for combining four statutory organisations of the wool industry into one—the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation. Wool International will market the stockpile and develop management and marketing strategies. The important factor about Wool International is the manner in which it will be developed and ultimately privatised. But Wool International must develop into a completely commercial organisation that will survive on its own merits. The wool industry has to accept the ultimate responsibility for its own destiny.

         I have already mentioned how wool has to become a competitive fibre. It is no use worrying about onkaparinga or physician blankets in a world that wants doonas. It is no good producing a fibre that the world does not want to buy. The demand for wool will grow only when we can show that it is the best fibre for the job.

         I have full faith in the ingenuity of Australian research and development and there is no doubt that we will find new uses for wool. That is already happening. The blending of wool and cotton and wool and synthetic fibres has been accepted by the fabric industry for years. The existence of knitting and weaving mills that are capable of using dual fibres is commonplace in the world today. The conditions necessary for these dual purpose mills to function is the diameter and the length of the staple of the fibre they are working with. I understand that there has been a continuous market during the depressed price for wool that is capable of being processed by the same machinery that processes cotton. This is a further indication that the buyer is the driving force in the modern economic world.

The intention of that report is to make the wool industry more commercial, and part of that commercial activity is to value add to our wool output. I appreciate that there is currently an excess of wool scouring and tops making facilities in the world—I agree with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) that Australia has a bright future in this area—but much of it is ageing and does not meet the exacting environmental standards of today.

Another by-product of a non-aqueous or solvent scouring plant is low grade nitrogen and phosphorous fertilisers which are very environmentally friendly.

Wool stored at Yennora cannot be included in value adding because Yennora is at the end of the line—the last stop before being shipped out of the country. It makes little sense to ship it back to the west to process and I am sure it will never be processed in the Sydney metropolitan area.

Those farmers have turned to alternatives such as wheat growing. They have literally said, `At this price if I do not sell the wool, it can stay where it is; I won't even pay the freight to town'.

         Once the industry realises that it has to take the market as it is, and carry its own stocks, the industry will bid for wool because it knows that, if it miscalculates a little, it will not get it from the stockpile. I trust that this time the industry will have confidence that we will not make other changes in the future and, consequently, it will buy with confidence in its own judgment. Hopefully, we will see the development of hedging type markets where people can protect their investment. But such markets were not prepared to bet against the decision making of politicians.

         The simple fact is that, for the first time since we have had the tragedy of the wool stockpile, we see a solution which comes back to simple arithmetic. There is some wool there and it has to be sold. The figures provided by Professor Garnaut suggest that in most years the amount of wool that will go onto the market—together with new production—will generally be a little less than what has been sold recently. So we will not actually flood the market with this stockpile, but we do have a plan to get rid of it.

I am sure it is the solution. Interestingly, there is a downside to this legislation. It does not provide for a continued government contribution to wool promotion, and that is a bit disappointing. I know that people get carried away with other aspects of our export potential. The government, quite proudly—and I have no objection—put some $100 million forward as being necessary to assist in the promotion of certain manufacturers that will never produce the sorts of import or export income that Australia wants, but which wool would produce. The government is rushing off into some new, green area to give some money for some unknown returns. A lot of this money is going to very large companies. We are told that they are small companies but, when we look further into their backgrounds, we find they are small companies, but subsidiaries of very large companies, including Telecom. Those companies have been identified in that report that suggests that small business has this wonderful future in export markets and in manufacturing.

That table had shown what the shearer got, the cost of transport, the cost of dumping and the cost of commission, but it did not show the government's share of the extra 31c a litre on diesel. That adds about $30,000 to the price of a truck that carts the sheep that carts the wool. The government is imposing all of these costs on an industry that is suffering through drought, international depression and international competition.

         It has always astounded me that in this country we can tax transport at three times the rate we tax other industries. It is just so plainly silly because we are such a large nation and we rely so heavily on transport in many ways. The wool industry has been the victim of this problem, both on the way in and on the way out.

         I come back to my specific concerns about this proposal—that is, that this legislation is never brought back into the parliament again. We have to know, and we have to make sure that the industry knows, that this is the final decision. It is the correct decision. It was always the correct decision to dispose of the stockpile by a quantity of wool, not by all of the other mechanisms that have been put up from time to time, and not by trying to second-guess the market.

         I think that those who survive—and I am deeply concerned for those who have huge problems today—will find that Australia has become a more efficient producer of wool. Many growers are quite wisely using this downturn to upgrade their flocks. They have sold off their second-rate sheep. When they come back into the market, we will have a much better system. I am hoping that the RAS arrangements and so on will not be used so much to get people off their properties as to help them stay there wherever that is even reasonably practical. Farmers will work hard to recover their circumstances.

I know there will be great interest in some of the specifics of that. I hope that the government, as has been suggested, makes it a very private company. In other words, we do not want another Wool Corporation or something of that nature; people should be able to sell on the market they choose. If there is a private company that woolgrowers seek to own, as this one may develop into, I have no problems. But that is for a further debate.

I congratulate the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) for getting on top of the problems that exist in our wool industry very quickly. These bills, the Wool International Bill and cognate bills, seek to establish a new institutionalised structure and marketing arrangements for the wool industry.

         The area that I am interested in is the opportunity that this gives Australia for a new focus on wool and our wool industry. It makes it more commercial and looks at new ways of marketing our wool. It will give a lot of people new opportunities in product development, new ideas in marketing, and develop a more local and regional strategy for wool and a more local focus on the region where that wool comes from. This is the direction in which we have to go. We can do so with these new endeavours.

         The way I see it, this proposal, while there is much merit in it—and many people have pointed out its merit—also shows that the government is walking away from the industry, saying to it, `You are entirely on your own from now on'. This is the fifth change in three years. Do honourable members remember the words that were being used about three years ago—for example, `immutable', `ironclad guarantees' and so on?

         I thought the former minister, the honourable member for Werriwa, in his speech tonight made a rather tragic sight as he was presumably making his swan song speech in the way he was trying to justify his role in the crisis that the wool industry has been facing for the last three years. If we look back to the comments he made in 1991, we can see just how unfortunate and how galling it must be for him to see all his efforts having failed so dismally.

         If we go back to 1987, we can see that the minister was not innocent. He approved the 870c floor price. He had his own source of information, most of it probably coming from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics. It was interesting to hear his comment about the efforts of the bureau in assisting him in his decision to reduce the floor price. Not only did he approve that but also he had to actively approve the increase in the borrowing limits for the Wool Corporation. Again, he cannot walk away from saying he was not responsible for some of the decisions taken; he was actively involved in those decisions.

         We then go to 1990-91 when the minister said that the 870c was to be reduced by 700c. I compliment him on saying that it was his decision and that he had written the speech in which he said that he was to make that decision. The fact is that he made that decision. He then went out and told the world that it was immutable. Seven months later, he pulled the plug on that. This cost one of our customers—not to mention many others—$50 million. Is it any wonder that there has been a lack of confidence in the industry? Mr Deputy Speaker, I put it to you in the strongest terms possible that much of that responsibility surely still has to lie with the government of the day and the minister involved.

         In considering some of the other aspects that have never been addressed in this debate that has not occurred yet, in October 1990 the wool tax was increased—this was for debt servicing—from 14 1/2 per cent to 21.15 per cent. Clearly, no grower has ever been compensated for that, no grower has asked for compensation, but again it shows the sort of mismanagement that was being undertaken. In 1991, we had the situation where the minister chose to split the Wool Corporation into three. Now, just two years later, we are seeing them being reduced back to two. All of this reinforces the view that the government has made one hell of a mess of the whole thing.

         As has been pointed out by my colleague the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), during the time that the stockpile was being accumulated the government benefited directly by between $500 million and $700 million in additional tax that it would not have otherwise received had it not been for the accumulation of wool in that stockpile; yet at the same time, as was pointed out, the income equalisation deposit scheme was cruelly delayed in its reintroduction until July 1991.

         All this leads to a fundamental question: what about the government's share of the responsibilities? The Garnaut report says that there is no straightforward answer when trying to decide who owes the debt and who owns the stockpile. Having made that observation, the Garnaut report goes on to decide that it is entirely the responsibility of the woolgrowers. On what I have pointed out so far, while I have great respect for the members of the committee who put together the Garnaut report, I come back to the question of the government's responsibility for the mess and the fact that, under this report, all costs are being borne entirely by the woolgrowers.

         Whichever way we look at it—whether from the point of view of the ethics of responsibility, the economic responsibility or the integral role which government, the minister and the parliament played in this whole sorry scenario—there is obviously quite a big responsibility resting on more than just the woolgrowers for the current crisis. It makes me very angry when I read in the press and hear some people refer to it being all the fault of greedy woolgrowers. There were a lot of woolgrowers who did not agree with what was being done and have had little opportunity to disagree.

         I have heard an interesting extension of this argument. If the government has said that woolgrowers should be brought to account over the collapse of the reserve price scheme and be responsible for the wool debt, we could extend that argument to other industries that have benefited from government interventions of various kinds. This raises some interesting issues. For example, would a government now contemplate suing workers and firms in the textiles and car industries because they got additional benefits that they no longer get? Should the government therefore recover the higher than current levels of assistance given to those industries, given that things have now changed? Those are the sorts of nonsenses that we might say are not relevant, but I suggest we think again because they are. It is an extension of the argument that has been put that it is entirely the responsibility of growers to pick up all the cost.

         I come back to the question of the fixed release. While I accept the argument that has been put very eloquently by many of my colleagues that we have to get wool moving out of the stockpile, I do raise the concern that, if the price were to collapse or to go to a very high level, there would be, in my opinion, very strong pressure on the government of the day to change the release rate. Notwithstanding the fact that I have an assurance from the Wool Council that it would not be putting that pressure on, I do question whether the government of the day would be able to resist that. Accordingly, while there are some very good things in this legislation from the Garnaut report, I do raise the concern that the schedule should be maintained.

         The second point that I raise on the Garnaut report is the premise behind it.

In today's

         there is a letter questioning some of the reasoning and logic of the Garnaut report. I hope that the minister would, as a matter of urgency, investigate this matter. I know, as the honourable member for Barker has already pointed out, that much of the figuring behind the Garnaut report and the government's decision is still being kept secret. That always raises questions as to what is being hidden.

         today and raised some questions about the assumptions that have been used in the modelling. He questions whether that result would be the same if different assumptions were used; in other words, the whole premise on which the Garnaut report has based its conclusions is now being challenged. I would have thought that the government, as a matter of urgency, would clear that up. One way to do that is to release all the working papers so that they can be properly examined by all members of the parliament; then we can do our duty in properly scrutinising this legislation.

         I have a few other concerns, but I come back to the major question: what is the real level of government responsibility in this matter, and how long will this plan last? Professor Garnaut has even admitted in his report that the 4.5 per cent tax probably is not necessary; it is really a bit of insurance for the government. So the government assumes no responsibility. Most woolgrowers, and all specialist woolgrowers, are finding it desperately difficult to survive. I have many in my electorate who are in desperate straits through no fault of their own, and that 4.5 per cent tax would be very valuable to them. Given that it has been admitted that it is not really necessary, I come back to the question of what responsibility is the government prepared to take, given that it has played such an integral role in the current demise of what was a once-great industry.

         A number of other points have been raised by my colleagues: the question of promotion; the question of the minister assuming the right to appoint all members of the board, and I will not go over them again. Given the concerns that I have raised, obviously I fervently hope that this legislation will hasten a recovery in the wool industry. I certainly believe there will be a recovery, but I have reservations which I have made clear. We look forward to seeing how the government will respond to the quite serious matters that I have raised.

         —in reply—In summing up in relation to this suite of amendments, I will make some general comments and have them relate to the next two bills that are going to be dealt with in the context of the procedures before the House. I appreciate the contributions that have been made in this debate. It is clear that there is very broad and wide support for the package of proposals that have come forward. There have been some amendments circulated by the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Anderson) on behalf of the opposition. He did foreshadow in his speech that consultations were continuing. I am pleased to be able to report that those consultations have been successful and they have resulted in me being now in a position, when we get to the committee stage in respect of both bills, to move a series of amendments that pick up a number of points.

         The consultations have been with the opposition and with the Wool Council of Australia. The amendments that will be proposed in the committee stage on behalf of the government reflect the outcome of those negotiations. I want to acknowledge the spirit with which the opposition and the Wool Council of Australia entered into these negotiations because I believe that, given that we did have such broad support with the basic thrust of the proposals before the House, it was important to try to continue to ensure that we had as wide as support as possible for the full package of measures.

         Briefly, in summing up, I can foreshadow the range of amendments that will be embraced so I do not need to take the time of the House when we get into the committee stage. In relation to one amendment that we are not accepting—the one in relation to the wool tax for the promotion of fellmongered wool—that issue was not before the Garnaut committee, nor was it argued, as I understand it, before the Garnaut committee by the Wool Council of Australia. However, I do understand the argument that is put but, given that we have not been able to have full discussions with the industry upon whom such a proposal would impact, my commitment is being prepared to examine this issue further, but certainly not to accept the amendment.

         So far as the other amendments are concerned, the ones that the government has been prepared to accede to relate to the Wool International Bill providing for a selection committee procedure to be introduced into this package of measures—providing the minister with nominations for consideration in the appointment of members to the appropriate bodies. I also foreshadow a number of amendments to the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993. Two of the amendments that we are prepared to accept to this bill place obligations on the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation to consult with the Wool Council of Australia in relation to the corporate plan, and also will make provision for a genuine consultation provision.

         Other amendments which the government is prepared to accept as a result of these negotiations provide for the selection committee which I referred to before. They move the facility for the Commonwealth appropriations for wool promotion from temporary provisions in the bill, as it currently stands, to make it a permanent feature in the legislation. We are extending the period of application for the temporary arrangements whereby the quality management functions that are to be divested by the AWRAP can occur over a longer period of time; we are extending the time period by one year.

         I conclude on the point that this has been a very lengthy process. Some can argue that it may have been rushed. I do not deny that we have worked to a very tight timetable, but at all stages we have announced what that timetable would be. We have met the timetable. We have consulted fully with all sections of the industry, and I am pleased to be able to bring the package of measures to the House and to be able to indicate that, now we have reached agreement on these final details, the package of measures will have the full support of the House. I thank those who have cooperated in this exercise for that.

         —As the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) has pointed out, negotiations have been going on behind the scenes all day between the coalition, the government and growers' representatives—namely, the Wool Council of Australia—over amendments to this legislation. These negotiations in relation to the amendments were along the lines of those foreshadowed by me in this place earlier tonight.

         I am pleased to hear the minister indicate that he is prepared to move amendments which satisfactorily cover our requirements. Perhaps the most important of those amendments goes to the matter of the selection process by which the boards of both Wool International and AWRAP will be chosen. There will now be a selection committee of four people—three chosen by the minister and one by the Wool Council. The minister has given me an assurance that he will also seek to consult with me, and I thank him for that.

         As the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) pointed out tonight, having the right people running the industry in general, and these boards in particular, will to a very great extent be the determinant of success or failure. No minister is the font of all wisdom when it comes to selecting the right people for any job, let alone this one. It is therefore appropriate that the amendments allow for what I believe is a much more balanced and mature approach to selection. I know that will do much to allay the fears and concerns about this area of industry leadership.

         The only other amendment on which I would like to comment is the one that allows for further government contribution. As I said earlier, promotion will be the other great determinant of the way in which this industry looks in a few years time. This is an industry which, until recently, contributed no less than one in every 10 Australian export dollars earned. Of course, that is not the situation today. We must, therefore, get wool back to its premier position.

         In conclusion, I would like to say that industry leaders have called long and loud for support of this package. They have indicated to both sides of this House that they do not want any further instability and that they want this package to go through subject only to the amendments as largely negotiated. I trust that that leadership will work overtime to have the package succeed for the sake of all in the industry—indeed, I could say for the sake not only of the entire rural community but for this very nation as well. In the national interest, we desperately need a restored, reinvigorated and prosperous wool industry as soon as possible.

         —Together with woolgrowers, the federal coalition hopes for the sake of the industry that this latest round of restructuring of the organisational base of the industry will be the last and that the changes targeted, arising from Professor Garnaut's report, actually grip and yield real and lasting benefits to struggling woolgrowers.

         I know that amongst woolgrowers there is a great deal of scepticism about the changes planned. My electorate of Gippsland has a large wool-growing sector and many growers have watched reports and industry plans come and go. In fact, in the course of this century we have seen industry reviews taking place at an average of one every three years. We would all have to understand if growers, who have to struggle day in and day out without having the time to look up, are not exactly applauding in an unqualified way the Garnaut report, because the immediate outlook for wool remains depressed.

         When farmers in my electorate actually get the chance to look up, all they have time to do is to check the surrounding properties which have gone to auction and worry even more about the valuation of their own properties and what the banks are thinking. However, the changes recommended by the Garnaut report represent what is likely to be the last best chance for the industry's longer term recovery, at least in regard to what this government will be able to provide.

         The bill before the House creates the new Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation, AWRAP. That organisation will work in parallel with the commercial objectives of Wool International, stressing market based research and development ventures and pushing the development end of wool research effort. Equally, AWRAP will have responsibility for conducting the industry's promotional program, an effort of extreme importance given the competition from other fibres. We must bear in mind that wool accounts for only four per cent of the world apparel market and that there are many markets that still do not understand the versatility of wool. That is a point about which Sir William Gunn had a little bit to say on national television earlier this week.

         Regardless of that, the coalition does have concerns about the selection methods employed by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) to constitute the board of AWRAP. Those concerns were expressed in the draft amendments floated by the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson). Because AWRAP is meant to act in the interests of growers—it is paid for by growers' funds through the wool tax—and because the body is not carrying any debt, there is no solid reason why grower representation cannot be greater than it is.

We cannot get to the substance of this legislation tonight. I do not believe that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) accepts that this is the way to conduct proceedings in this place. It is a matter of extreme importance to woolgrowers from one end of this country to the other. The whole debate has been guillotined. Every time there have been debates on this matter, they have been guillotined.

         There are woolgrowers in my electorate who go to their bank on Friday afternoon at 4 o'clock to get sustenance money for their families for the next week. This industry is in absolute crisis. The one thing it desperately needs is stability. We cannot have stability when we have been running around this place for the preceding two hours, with the Australian Wool Council members ensconced in one area and the minister, the shadow minister for primary industries, the honourable for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), in another area, trying to resolve these matters in the short time available.

         The coalition amendments, which I am pleased the minister has taken up, have addressed at least one area of concern of the VFF. However, the promotion question is still the big noose hanging over the whole legislation. I do not know whether the legislation will work; the great number of woolgrowers who have contacted me do not know either. But everyone is absolutely desperate to see something that works. I sincerely hope that we will not have to come back to this place in two years time to go through the whole process again.

         —If we do, as the honourable member for Wakefield said, there will not be any woolgrowers left. It is not just for the individuals and their families, but for the whole social and economic structure of rural areas that are deeply reliant on the survival of woolgrowers. We desperately need to protect that and, if we do not, this parliament, economy and the whole Australian public, will pay the most extraordinary price. I ask the minister on behalf of the people who have contacted me—of whom there are very many—to please ensure that something is done about promotion. At the end of the day that will be the key to the success of this whole package. It is the vital element, but unfortunately it is missing.

         —Following the comments of the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) regarding promotion, and as possibly the last word in this debate, I stress that the coalition does not believe that the promotion of wool can proceed effectively without the government extending its funding commitments. There is no way around it. Consequently, we have sought an extension of promotion support for the industry in line with its own funding undertakings, which have been in the public arena for some seven months.

         The government has been happy to restructure the industry and make woolgrowers pay the price, but has been reluctant to dip into its own pocket in the interests of the industry and the nation. This is a continuing theme of the government's approach to the industry. It has been prepared to restructure the industry to the last woolgrower, but not to use its resources or exercise discipline to help the industry positively. We have had battles—and they will continue—over access to entitlements by farmers, the use of asset testing on allowances and so on, and how inflexible capital gains rulings have weakened the safety net in rural regions.

         There are other government driven costs to woolgrowers which, if removed, could provide added incentive for growers to stay in business. I have never believed that the starting point of a restructuring exercise ought to be with depleting industry numbers and constricting supply. This is the easiest policy for a government to pursue because it puts the onus on someone other than itself. If governments could reduce the cost burden on woolgrowers, we could keep more of them in the industry, allow them a decent chance to restructure, work their financial situations out and have a choice about their futures.

         But under current government policy they have no choices. Buried under escalating costs they have no chance. Every farmer pays up to $1,600 per year in sales tax. That is going up a further 2 per cent as a result of the budget, unless the Greens or Australian Democrats support the coalition in the Senate to block that iniquitous tax measure. The industry has lost another $4.5 million with changes to the diesel fuel rebate scheme. The growers pay processing costs, which are uncompetitive. Their on-road fuel bills have jumped by 5c a litre. Their road and rail freight shipping costs have risen with the 5c increase in diesel for non-rebated users, the trucking industry and rail networks included.

         While the government might like to congratulate itself on its courage in inflicting so much pain on farmers to get the restructuring policies through, it might spare a thought about how much of the pain was needless and unnecessary and driven only by its inability to put its house in order first. There has been a virtual halving of the supply of wool in the space of three years. Production is now around 690 million kilograms, and still sliding. That is down from 1,100 million kilograms in 1989-90, a massive change in industry activity in anyone's reckoning. It has come at an enormous cost. Some woolgrowers have been lucky enough to hold on for a variety of reasons, others have diversified, moving into other commodities such as dairy, beef or grains. Sadly, many woolgrowers have gone under and their lives and those of their families have been scarred forever.

         Those who do not live in rural electorates will hardly understand the impact on the community of farm foreclosures and the like. The government cannot neatly and so simply pass the onus of industry restructuring onto woolgrowers. There is a great deal it can do to put its house in order and lower the savage input costs that make so many woolgrowers and those in other agricultural pursuits uncompetitive, particularly in the light of so many world-corrupted markets.

         Tonight I want to bring up a situation which is, unfortunately, all too familiar. It is the case of an Australian technical invention which, because of the lack of official support, looks like leaving Australia. It is not just any invention. As you would know, Mr Speaker, from your close attention to television and films over many years, the 3D presentation of films has been looked at by the major technical corporations around the world for many years. They have sought a way in which 3D pictures can be projected without the usual encumbrances of red-green spectacles and all that sort of paraphernalia, as has been the case in the past.

         This particular technology has been sought, as I have said, by leading companies overseas for many years now. The fact is that a small Australian company has, it appears, come up with not only a technically feasible but also a very workable system for projecting images in 3D onto television screens and simulators and for a whole range of other uses.

         The unfortunate fact is that, despite the knowledge of this technical breakthrough being available in Australia, there is no official support for this company from any avenue of government or non-government sources which would enable this breakthrough to be developed in Australia. Just think of the ramifications of accurate 3D projections in simulation activities, television, film or medicine—right throughout these avenues. The inventors simply do not have, at this stage, the commercial or government backing for the development of this breakthrough here in Australia. But that is not the case in relation to the interest evinced in this development by major overseas corporations. There is no doubt that the inventors of the system will do well out of it, simply because a path is being beaten to their door by major overseas investors.

         The point I wish to bring to the attention of the House tonight is that this major technical breakthrough, developed in Australia, is simply not being supported within Australia. There are enormous ramifications, not only for overseas sales but for potential employment opportunities, should this development be kept in Australia and further developed here in Australia. I put it to the government tonight that this is yet another of those interesting and exciting developments which—if we do not take a special interest in it—will forever leave our shores. In the future, we will be buying back this Australian technology in so many different fields unless interest is manifested from either government or commercial organisations in Australia to ensure that the development stays in Australia and is further developed in Australia.

         The government should look at this development very closely. It is an exciting development which has been sought throughout the world for literally decades. It has not been achieved anywhere else in the world. It has been discovered in Australia. It can be developed in Australia. The amounts of money required to further that development are not very great. It is something the government should place emphasis on to make sure that we do not, yet again, allow a technical breakthrough to be taken away from Australia simply because we do not support it here.

         —The Turnbull committee report is a balanced and measured examination of the issues associated with Australia becoming a republic. The monarchists in our community and, indeed, certain prominent members of the opposition have complained about the fact that the report does not advance reasons as to why Australia should become a republic. They obviously have not read the committee's terms of reference which clearly imposed an obligation on the committee to report with respect to how Australia could go about becoming a republic. That is why the committee was established—to further the implementation of the commitment made by the government at the last election for Australia to move towards becoming a republic.

         The report is about the mechanics, the logistics, of Australia becoming a republic and it is for that reason that it is entirely logical that the committee was headed by a republican. It was not intended to ask: `Should we or should we not become a republic?' It was intended to report to the government how such a move could be made and to examine in detail the obviously complex issues associated with republican change to our constitution.

         The committee focused, quite rightly, on key questions relating to the powers granted to, and method of appointment of, a head of state. The committee correctly identified that, if we were to have a popularly elected president or head of state, that person would need to have his or her powers very strictly defined. The committee has, unfortunately, failed to identify a key problem with one of the possible methods of appointment of a head of state, namely, a special majority of parliament, and that relates to an opposition that would use its effective veto power—if a two-thirds majority were required for appointment—to force an election.

         The situation that currently prevails in Greece—which honourable members are probably not aware of—is that, in the near future, the Greek President will be required to be re-elected and a special majority will be needed in the parliament. If that special majority is not obtained, an election—well short of the term the government is due to serve—will be forced. Particularly when we recall the events of 1975, I can foresee a situation where a president of this country has finished a term of office; and, if a two-thirds majority were required, an opposition, seeking to force an election, could simply refuse to vote for any nominee of the government.

         The committee also makes a number of other very worthwhile points, one of them being that there is a need for far greater education, at both the primary and secondary level, with respect to our constitution and our system of government. Ignorance is the foremost weapon of reaction. Certainly, conservative political forces across the world generally do not desire ordinary people to be knowledgeable about political frameworks, the system of government and the country in which they reside. I would say to the House that, in other spheres, we should be pursuing proper education about our system of government and constitution. I applaud the report for that reason.

Perhaps people will recognise that, even if we have only a symbolic change—a change to a republic effectively is only symbolic because it is a minimalist position—symbols are important. Honourable members on the other side of the House surely recognise that the Australian flag is a symbol and that symbols can be very important; that, therefore, an Australian republic is equally a very important symbolic change.

         Will we hear absurd outbursts from the opposition, such as: `Well, this country here is a republic and it has an unstable situation; therefore the republic is causing that', or `That country is a monarchy and it happens to be stable'. It is the nature of the society that produces a stable society and government; it is not the reverse. For example, Switzerland is one of the most stable and wealthy countries in the world and it has been a republic for a thousand years. Thailand has a very revered monarchy. That did not prevent many people being massacred in the streets last year.

         —For the last few weeks grandstands, pit buildings, fences and crash barriers have been going up around the south-western boundaries of Sturt in preparation for this year's Australian Formula One Grand Prix. It will be the ninth time the race has been run. Thousands of tourists will be flocking to the circuit, giving a bonus to nearby pubs and restaurants. Millions of people around the world will view the race on television. It is a great promotion for South Australia.

         Unfortunately, there are not many others. Ever since the days of the Dunstan government, tourism has been a much touted panacea for South Australia's economic ills. Despite this, our market share of international visitor nights has declined throughout the 11 years of the Bannon and Arnold Labor governments. In 1985, the year the Grand Prix was first run, South Australia had eight per cent of the market. Since then, the figure has fallen to 4.9 per cent, a massive 40 per cent drop. This is despite $77 million worth of taxpayers' money being spent on tourism marketing.

         Australia-New Zealand Aviation Fast Fax reported only last Friday that Adelaide international airport has the second lowest number of international air passengers in Australia, in front of Hobart. The Labor Party has failed to develop successful marketing strategies for the interstate and international tourism markets throughout its 11 years in government. Its advertisements and promotions have been unimaginative and, with the decline in tourism growth, scarcely cost-effective.

         South Australia offers a fresh and friendly environment that should make an attractive tourism destination. Adelaide has a strong reputation in the arts and cultural circles, and we offer visitors a unique mixture of desert landscape, ocean and classic Australian countryside. However, when it comes to serious promotion of South Australia, we seem to have an `It's all too hard' approach. Earlier this year the American ABC network broadcast

         —It is with great regret that no-one from Queensland was allowed to speak tonight on the wool debate because of the guillotine and the arrangements as far as speaking orders are concerned. A recent report, the Newman report produced by the Longreach Arid Zone Research Station, indicates that the debt levels in this current financial year will reach $400,000 for two-thirds of the industry and the operating losses will be $40,000 a year. That means that within two years, since most of these properties are 25,000 acres and their land values will probably be down to about $20 an acre, 50 per cent of the entire number of wool producers in the state of Queensland will be insolvent.

         The Garnaut report, which effectively was passed here tonight, will not do one single thing to help those people. What will help those people is the fact that a 30 per cent increase in demand and a 30 per cent decrease in production will indicate clearly that somewhere over the next one, two or three years the price of wool will rise very dramatically. Maybe we will be lucky enough to see that happen within 12 months and rescue most of these people; maybe we will not.

Constantly the most dreadful error has been reiterated throughout Australia—and I regret to say by people on my side of the House—in attributing the collapse of the wool industry to some sort of market fluctuations.

         —I want to put on record the fact that the honourable member for the Northern Territory is laughing. He finds this funny. I think a lot of people on his side of the House do find this funny. Before the infamous press conference of the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), only 20 per cent of the wool coming onto the Australian market was being purchased by the government instrumentality. After his press conference, 80 per cent of the Australian wool clip had to be picked up by the Australian instrumentality at the time.

         So what actually happened was: he went public and said that the price of wool will be put down by the Australian government. That is effectively the clear-cut signal that he sent out to the entire world and to all the wool buyers in the world. Every single one of them had to stop buying wool and, of course, the auction system went down. So the sellers were still there but there were no buyers and the price fell through the floor. Any person who wishes to do the research will see clearly that before that press conference 80 per cent of trade was being taken up by the free market forces purchasing that wool and after the press conference those figures were exactly reversed.

         The same people that destroyed the wool industry in Australia, the biggest export earning item of this nation, then proceeded to attribute the wreckage to some sort of shortcoming in the pricing mechanism which we had. Let me say to the House once again that where we have tens of thousands of sellers and only half a dozen or a dozen buyers—that is exactly the situation in the wool, sugar beef industries—the economists have a name for it. They call it an oligopolist situation. It is a big name. To most of us it means a monopoly situation. It is not a pure monopoly. There is not one buyer; there are half a dozen buyers. It amounts to much the same thing.

         The Australian version of the Westminster system was always a parochial compromise irrespective of the rosy rhetoric about founding fathers. To the extent that it has worked reasonably well since Federation is a tribute to the nature of the Australian community as much as the system. The last decade has seen an increasing breakdown of the system as a majority of the 15 Australian houses of parliament have slipped from the respective government control. The present Senate impasse is a continuation of the trend. The Senate, created out of fear of centralism and given equal legislative power with the House of Representatives, always contained a number of dilemmas.

         The equal legislative power of the Senate, but based on  equal representation from the states, means that federalism is really incompatible with democracy.

The House of Representatives hardly represents the legitimate popular will, given the distortions of electoral distribution within states, minimum Tasmanian representation and the winner-take-all nature of single member electorates, which means that the number of seats in relation to votes is virtually random.

         These problems together with the changes in society, both nationally and internationally, since 1901 create an overwhelming case for constitutional reform. As the republican debate develops, the political parties will realise that only a directly elected government will serve both its interests and the public interests. In a diverse society which aspires to be a democracy with fair voting systems, a directly elected government with fixed terms and a proper separation of government, legislature and judiciary is the only way to achieve stability and accountability and democratically reflect a diversity of political opinion.

         It was inspiring to address a group whose values both mirrored and promoted the Christian ethic. I say `humbled' because I realised that this comparatively small organisation of 2,400 members and 1,400 auxiliary members has over the last 37 years been responsible for the distribution of 8.6 million Bibles throughout Australia. Put another way and assuming all were still in use, this means that this unselfish and dedicated group has given out sufficient Bibles to cover half the population of this country.

Its next target is eastern Europe with an estimated distribution of 500,000 per month. After 70 years of atheism and materialism, it is a remarkable if not daunting task.
