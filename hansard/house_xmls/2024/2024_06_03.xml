              <span class="HPS-Small">Rail usage needs to be boosted in Queensland to get more cars off the Bruce Highway which will lower maintanence costs and reduce the risk of crashes, the North Coast Railway Line has had very little major investment since the 1990's, and the travel times are long. Sections of track between Townsville and Rockhampton need to be re-aligned and grading improved as well as grade seperation of crossings and rationalization of rural crossings to allow faster (160km/hr and above) and more frequent services to run with the eventual plan to duplicate and electrify the line to separate passenger and freight traffic. I single out the section between Townsville and Rockhampton as this section is mostly flat and the SEQ network already is duplicated and has electrification. The section north of Townsville has complex topography that would push costs even higher. This project would reduce travel times between Regional Cities and allow for better connections with South East Queensland and would result in transformative economic co-operation, increased productivity, and better social cohesion between North and South East Queensland helping to stave off calls for a seperate NQ State. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">In 2020, the Government of the day touted that the rollout of the NBN was complete. However, many Australians have been left stranded without access to this vital "Government-planned" cyberinfrastructure and are now forcibly dependent on an aging and snail-paced ADSL and/or 3G network. The reason behind this petition is well summed up in this May 08, 2022, Guardian article, 'They will do nothing to fix it': why the NBN still matters to many voters. And more recently, by the Federal Communications Minister in news articles about the shutdown of the 3G network. In 2024—these (very real &amp; debilitating) issues still plague many Australian households (recent data suggests at least 750,000). Those now reliant on an ailing network because they cannot connect to the NBN are stranded in virtual communications paralysis.

              <span class="HPS-Small">An increasing number of software companies (foreign and local) publish software that is arbitrarily required to 'phone home' in order to function. This is especially prevalent in entertainment software such as videogames.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Unlike normal software, when a publisher discontinues such products they do not simply end development and technical support—instead, they choose to render all copies of the software inoperable, effectively withdrawing customers' rights under the Australian Consumer Law to ownership and undisturbed possession of their purchased goods.</span>

The Australian law (Family Law Act under section 60B(2)(b)) recognizes that children have a right to spend time regularly with and communicate regularly with their parents and grandparents as people significant to their care, welfare and development. The government recognizes the importance of relationships with grandparents and advocates the role of grandparents in the lives of children and grandchildren. But naturalised citizens and residents are discriminated against, and their naturally recognized right to spend time with their parents and grandparents is being denied by: a. a very unreasonable timeline for processing the parent visas (i.e. 12 to 29 years) with costs going up to AUD48,365; and b. introducing the family balance test as a prerequisite for processing parent visas.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">In Australia, there is no constitutional right to privacy. While the Privacy Act 1988, and the Surveillance Devices Act 2004 &amp; 2007 serve as important pieces of legislation, they have not been adequately updated to reflect important technological advances, such as the advent of the Internet. Furthermore, the extremely antiquated Telecommunications Act (Interception and Access) (TIA) 1979 exposed Australians to draconian interception of their data and private communications from Intelligence Services and the Police in 2014 without so much as a given warrant or notice, even if their private messages could be deleted and/or altered. These laws have not kept pace with advancements of the 21st century, and put Australia's most vulnerable at risk. These people include Women and Children, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, people with disabilities and the poor—but also the population at large. It further compromises everyone from victims of Coercive Control, Violence, and Bullying from managers at work and from landlords from getting the Legal Protection they need in order to protect themselves. Privacy is a fundamental aspect of human dignity, and it is also a human right. As a ratified member of the United Nations, Australia upholds the values of the UN Charter of Human Rights. Therefore, Australia's privacy laws should be revisited to reflect human rights in the modern world, as it is undemocratic to deny people their freedom and safety by lawfully enabling their exposure to control by surveillance by those more powerful.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">We, the undersigned, respectfully petition for the implementation of a 31.87% expenditure cap over the next six years, starting from 2030.

This rebate would provide essential relief to Australian households grappling with high energy costs, particularly benefiting lower and middle-income families. Additionally, it would incentivize energy efficiency and productivity enhancements, contributing to a more sustainable future for all.</span>

Transparent reporting, regular evaluation, and adjustment procedures will be vital for monitoring the program's impact and efficiency.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">As a software engineer with over four years of dedicated service in Australia, I applied for the 186TRT visa. Until a few months ago, the DHA was prioritizing offshore applicants over onshore due to market needs which wasn't fair to us, but I was encouraged by the progress in processing all applications. However, recent ministerial direction 105 supporting regional businesses resulted in the halt of processing metro applicants including us, who have contributed to the economy and filled skill shortages since the challenging times of COVID without visiting loving ones in pandemic. We are not the cause of housing crisis. It's disheartening to see our applications deprioritized, especially when we've been lawfully residing in Australia for years, paying taxes and our super, and supporting the community. Some of us may not be eligible or have the trust to apply another visa and turn back if things won't go as expected. The eligibility or nature of businesses can change until a decision is made which is possible given the current global processing timeline. Many of us have specialized skills due to our commitment and experience, contributing significantly to Australia. It's crucial to receive a decision promptly. Waiting indefinitely jeopardizes our future, self-confidence, and negotiating power in this tough economic situation, reducing productivity and undermining the government's goal of ending the cycle of temporary residency and dependency on employers.</span>

This medication is frequently prescribed as a treatment for women with chronic pelvic pain conditions such as Endometriosis, Adenomyosis and PCOS. However, this medication is up to seven times more expensive than other contraceptive pills.

              <span class="HPS-Small">I am a survivor, as is someone very dear to me. We are among the countless victims of child sexual abuse, a crime so heinous it's hard to comprehend. The pain we've endured is unimaginable, and we know there are many more out there suffering in silence. It's time for our justice system to reflect the severity of these crimes.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Child sex offenders often receive lenient sentences that do not match the gravity of their actions. According to RAINN (Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network), only 5 out of every 1,000 perpetrators will end up in prison. This lack of severe punishment not only fails to deter potential offenders but also adds insult to injury for victims who have bravely come forward.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We propose two changes: Firstly, significantly increase jail time for convicted child sex offenders. Secondly, open a national debate on legalising the death penalty for such crimes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These measures may seem drastic but consider this—according to the U.S Department of Justice's National Sex Offender Public Website (NSOPW), approximately 60% of perpetrators are known to the child but are not family members; friends, babysitters or neighbours—people children should be able to trust implicitly.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">This is a social and economic disaster waiting to happen, and it's putting Australia on a path towards chaos. Australian living standards are plummeting, and our young and most vulnerable are being forever locked out of the housing market.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

This outdated infrastructure continues to serve vital purposes, especially in rural and remote areas where access to 4G or 5G networks is limited or non-existent. Discontinuing 3G would exacerbate the digital divide, impact businesses and emergency services, force unnecessary upgrades for consumers, and disrupt voice traffic that relies on 3G networks.</span>

This limitation affects a growing number of Australians who rely on cannabis for health and well-being, making device access cumbersome and restrictive. By aligning these devices with medical device regulations, they would still adhere to rigorous safety and quality standards, mirroring the controls on similar healthcare products. This change would facilitate better access, allowing responsible use and ensuring safety through regulated manufacturing standards. Countries with similar regulatory adjustments have seen improved public health outcomes, consumer safety, and access to these devices.</span>

It entered into force on 22 January 2021. The TPNW is the first globally applicable multilateral agreement to comprehensively prohibit nuclear weapons .. Nuclear disarmament is a cause that all countries must embrace. A single nuclear weapon could destroy a city. Civilians would make up most of the casualties and responders would be unable to work in devastated, radioactively contaminated areas. No country could stop the radioactive fallout that would transcend national borders if these weapons are ever used again. No country is immune to the climate disruption, agricultural and economic collapse, mass human displacement and famine that would inevitably follow even a 'limited' nuclear war. Nuclear weapons serve no legitimate military or strategic purpose and, given their indiscriminate nature, cannot be used in conformity with international law. By ratifying the TPNW, Australia can help strengthen the global norm against the possession and use of nuclear weapons and make an important contribution to their total elimination. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 12 February 2024 regarding petition EN5653 on subsidies allocated to road transport and rail infrastructure. I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is investing over $35 billion in rail infrastructure projects over the ten-years from 2023-24, including in Inland Rail, Sydney Metro—Western Sydney Airpo1t, Logan and Gold Coast Faster Rail, Suburban Rail Loop East, Direct Sunshine Coast Rail Line, Metronet, Melbourne Airport Rail Link and Canberra Light Rail. The Government is also making complementary rail infrastructure investments in the Moorebank and Beveridge intermodal precincts via the National Intermodal Corporation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 14 November 2023, I released the Infrastructure Policy Statement which sets out three strategic themes that will guide future Government investment decisions: Productivity and Resilience, Liveability and Sustainability. Future investments will have a range of significant economic, social and environmental objectives including ensuring they contribute to Australia's future sustainability and net zero ambitions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has also set ambitious targets for emissions reduction and strong action will be required across all transp01t modes. Work to deliver these targets for transport will be undertaken in a planned and coordinated way to help ensure we can take up economic and productivity oppo1tunities, while carefully managing the transition to new energy sources for the whole of our transport sector.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Yours sincerely </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 12 February 2024 regarding petition EN5691, which asked the House to strengthen protections for whistleblowers. I welcome the opportunity to respond to this petition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Government is committed to ensuring that Australia has effective frameworks to protect whistleblowers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013 </span>(PID Act) is an important element of the Commonwealth's integrity and transparency framework. The PID Act enables public officials to disclose suspected wrongdoing by another public official or by an Australian Government agency and requires disclosures to be properly investigated and dealt with.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It also provides those public officials with the assurance that, if they make their disclosure in accordance with the requirements of the PID Act, they will be protected from reprisal and immune from administrative, criminal and civil liability, including absolute privilege in proceedings for defamation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is delivering on its commitment to strengthen protections for public sector whistleblowers through staged reform of the public sector whistleblowing framework.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 1 July 2023, priority amendments to the PID Act came into effect, which ensured immediate improvements to the public sector whistleblower scheme were in place for the commencement of the National Anti-Corruption Commission. These reforms implemented 21 of the 33 recommendations from the 2016 Review of the PID Act by Mr Philip Moss AM as well as recommendations from other parliamentary committee reports. Key measures in the legislation strengthened protections for disclosers and witnesses, focused the framework on integrity-related wrongdoing, made the framework easier to administer, and enhanced oversight of the framework by the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In late 2023, the Government released a consultation paper on a second stage of reforms to ensure the framework remains fit for purpose and accessible for public officials to report wrongdoing. The second stage of reforms will consider the remaining recommendations of the Moss Review and other relevant reports and reviews, as well as stakeholder views expressed in the public consultation. The second stage of reforms is an opportunity to further improve the public sector whistleblowing framework by considering how to address the underlying complexity of the PID Act and what steps can be taken to provide effective and accessible protections to public sector whistleblowers.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information is of assistance.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning a petition (EN5784) recently presented in the House concerning the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) supervisory cost recovery levy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government acknowledges the impact of regulatory costs on businesses, including financial advice businesses, and the need for fairness in the implementation of ASIC's Industry Funding Model (IFM).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The IFM is established on the principle that those who create the need for a regulatory activity or benefit from it should bear the associated costs, rather than burdening general taxpayers. The Government has carefully reviewed ASIC's IFM and the final report of the review, which I released on 26 June 2023, re-emphasised this important principle.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the petition notes, licensees that provide personal advice to retail clients were provided temporary support during the pandemic via a reduction in their levies in relation to the 2020-21 and 2021-22 financial years. However, this was not intended to be permanent given the principle outlined above. It would also raise concerns about fairness to other sub- sectors that contribute to ASIC funding under the IFM. The 2022-23 graduated levy component for personal advice licensees (sometimes referred to as the 'per advisor levy') reflects the amount required to recover relevant costs in 2022-23, as set out in ASIC's Cost Recovery Implementation Statement. The size of its apparent increase over previous years reflects that in the relief years those costs were not recovered from that sub-sector in full.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note the petitioners' concern that fees for advisers appear to be increasing while fees for licensees 'remain at $1,500', however, this is not how the IFM operates. As a matter of law, ASIC's supervisory cost recovery levies for the financial advice sector are imposed entirely on licensees, not on individual advisers. Like many other sub-sectors, the ASIC IFM levy for licensees that provide personal advice is scaled based on the size of the entity. This ensures there is fairness in how the levy applies across different licensees. For licensees that provide personal advice on relevant financial products to retail clients, the levy is a minimum of $1,500 plus a variable amount—the graduated levy component—per registered adviser. The number of advisers is used here as the proxy for the size of the licensee. Increasing the minimum levy component would make the levy less reflective of licensee size; larger licensees would pay relatively less, while smaller licensees would pay relatively more.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Once a licensee's levy is calculated, it is up to the individual licensee how it pays the levy, including what component (if any) it requires its advisers to pay. Whether or how a licensee passes on the levy to its authorised representatives is a matter for their contractual relationship; the Government has no expectation that the licensee will pay the minimum levy component while the adviser pays the remainder.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The IFM review recommended considering certain sub-sector definitions, entity metrics, and levy formulas to ensure they remain appropriate for the calculation of the levies. The Government intends to consult on these changes in due course and I encourage affected financial advisers to participate in that consultation process.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has a comprehensive package to ensure Australians have access to quality and affordable financial advice when they need it most. On 7 December 2023 I announced the Government's <span style="font-style:italic;">Delivering Better Financial Outcomes</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"></span>package and response to the Quality of Advice Review, which includes a number of measures aimed at reducing red tape for professional advisers, including replacing Statements of Advice with a fit-for-purpose advice record, streamlining ongoing fee renewal and consent requirements, and removing the requirement to provide a fee disclosure statement and providing more flexibility on how financial services guide requirements can be met.</span>
            </p>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN5808.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government understands the important role cash still plays in our payments system and supports Australians having continued access to cash.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The use of cash as a method of payment has been declining for many years due to changing consumer preferences and advances in technology. This long-run trend has been reinforced by changes in payment behaviour arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Nonetheless, cash is an important payment method for certain groups and plays a vital role in their inclusion in the wider economy. Cash is still widely accepted as a means of payment by merchants, used as a store of value, and provides resilience to the payments system during outages where digital forms of money cannot be used.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 7 June 2023, the Government released its the Strategic Plan for Australia's Payments System (the Plan), which details the policy priorities and objectives of the Government in relation to payments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">One of the initiatives in the Plan was 'Maintaining adequate access to cash'. As part of this, the Government will work with relevant agencies across the public sector and with industry to ensure that Australia has a sustainable cash distribution network that maintains adequate access to cash.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Department is aware that the withdrawal of Defence and Department of Veterans' Affairs (OVA) Human Research Ethics Committee approval on Monday, 5 February 2024 has increased concerns in the veteran community regarding the Veterans' MATES Program (MATES), particularly in relation to the sharing of data. MATES has sought to support veterans and their families to manage their health and aligns strongly with DVA's objective to proactively support the health and wellbeing of veterans.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      22.7pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is important to note that there has not been any unauthorised access of veteran data. The data has not been made available publicly or for nefarious purposes. OVA only ever provided client data for the purposes of MATES to a trusted organisation, the University of South Australia (UniSA) under strict data security and access policies.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">OVA provided the data to UniSA in accordance with the ethics approvals in place at the time. This was done via a secure and carefully controlled channel. UniSA stored the data in a secure facility. Billing data was automatically de-identified before being accessed by researchers for the thematic review under the MATES program. The data did not include doctor's notes. Identifying data was only used to communicate with the veteran themselves, as well as their doctor, in the event that the analysis of the de- identified data revealed risks to the veteran's health. The letters that went to veterans and their doctors provided invaluable insights that supported those veterans receiving the most appropriate treatment possible.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Following an Office of the Australian Information Commissioner decision in April 2023, an external review was conducted concerning the administration of opt-out procedures in the MATES program.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 18 March 2024 regarding petition EN5889 on officially recognising lipoedema as a progressive, chronic, and debilitating disease and advocating for Medicare coverage for affected individuals.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government acknowledges the significant burden that chronic conditions, such as lipoedema, have on individuals and their families and carers and is committed-to supporting those impacted. The Government is committed to supporting a strong healthcare system that will deliver the best possible outcomes for patients and reduce the impact that chronic conditions have on Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Supporting, protecting and promoting the health and wellbeing of all Australian women and girls is a key priority for the Government. The health of Australian women and girls is critical to their overall wellbeing and ability to participate in society. Women's health impacts not only individuals but also their families and communities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In February 2023, the Government established the National Women's Health Advisory Council (Council) to provide strategic advice and recommendations directly to Government, to improve health outcomes for Australian women and· girls. The Council is also providing advice on implementation of the National Women's Health Strategy 2020-2030 (Strategy) which outlines a national approach to reducing inequalities and improving health outcomes for all women and girls particularly those at greatest risk of poor health.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Strategy identifies five priority areas to address to improve health outcomes for Australian women and girls, including:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      34pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">priority area three chronic conditions and preventive health, which aims to increase awareness and prevention of chronic conditions, symptoms and risk factors, irivest in targeted prevention, early detection and intervention and tailor health services for women and girls</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      34pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">priority area four mental health, which aims to lower incidents of mental health reporting, eating disorders, self-harm and suicide and focus on early intervention, diagnosis and access to mental health care for Australian women and girls.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Council recently held the National Women's Health Summit {Summit), which brought together experts, policymakers, community advocates, and women with lived experience to discuss how Australia can fundamentally transform the health system to improve access to health care, services and outcomes for women. Participants at the Summit highlighted the issues experienced by women and girls and results from the Council's #EndGenderBias survey were presented at the Summit which highlighted concerns about women's pain being dismissed and disbelieved.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Council's #EndGenderBias survey heard from many stakeholders to better understand the unique barriers and gender bias women face in Australia's healthcare system. The survey found two thirds of women surveyed reported they experienced health care related gender bias or discrimination, and gender bias was experienced most in relation to sexual and reproductive health and chronic pain. The Council will consider the findings from the Summit, results from the #EndGenderBias survey and the work of its subcommittees to develop its recommendations and advice to Government.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In terms of the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS), patients with lipoedema may be eligible for MBS Chronic Disease Management (CDM) items. To be eligible for CDM items a patient must have at least one medical condition that has been present or is likely to be present for at least six months or is terminal. There is no list of eligible conditions. Whether a patient meets the eligibility requirement of having a chronic condition is a clinical judgement for their GP.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The CDM items enable GPs to plan and coordinate the health care of patients with chronic medical conditions. GPs may refer patients to up to five MBS rebated allied health services per calendar year under a GP Management Plan and Team Care Arrangement. In addition, up to five services with a practice nurse or Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Practitioner that are provided on behalf of a medical practitioner can also be accessed each calendar year.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There are currently no items on the MBS that provide for the surgical or liposuction treatment of lipoedema. In order for a new medical service to be added to the MBS for the treatment of lipoedema, an application would need to be made to the Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC). MSAC appraises new medical services and provides advice to Government on whether they should be publicly funded based on an assessment of the best available evidence of its comparative safety, clinical effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Anyone can submit an application to MSAC, however due to the level of evidence required, a medical professional group is generally best placed to provide the necessary research and trial data. Further information about the MSAC process is available at www.msac.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 18 March 2024 regarding Petition EN5895—which requests the National Capital Authority (NCA) update and expand the Centenary of Women Suffrage Fountain to include and honour all significant figures and milestones in support of Women's suffrage.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I understand that under Standing Order 209(a) and (b), the Petitions Committee has referred a copy of this petition to me, as the Minister responsible for the administration of the matter raised in the petition. I expect to be able to respond to the petition within 90 days of the petition being presented.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The timeline of the Centenary of Women's Suffrage Commemorative Fountain is designed to mark milestones of women's achievement in the federal political process. The NCA is reviewing the curatorial themes for the timeline with a view to expanding the recognition of women in Australian political life. This would require extensive consultation to ensure an informed and well-balanced representation, and the suggestions included in the petition will inform that process.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Health Care: Medicinal Cannabis</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 18 March 2024 regarding petition number EN5923, about medicinal cannabis cost issues and access through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) for everyone that needs it.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am aware many Australians are experiencing difficulties with the cost of medicinal cannabis, and patients are reporting benefits since commencing the medicine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government enables access to affordable medicines by listing medicines on the PBS that have been recommended by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC). Under legislation, the Government can only list a medicine on the PBS when the PBAC recommends doing so. Similarly, the Government relies on the advice of the PBAC before changing an existing PBS listing. The PBAC is an independent and expert body, comprising doctors, health professionals, health economists and consumer representatives.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">When the PBAC evaluates applications for PBS subsidy, it is legally required to consider effectiveness and cost of the medicine, compared to alternative treatments. There is no legal provision for subsidised supply of a non-PBS-listed medicine, or for a PBS-listed medicine outside the terms of its listing (or specific restrictions). No exceptions are permitted for individual patients, even in particular cases where the medicine might be beneficial or recommended on clinical grounds.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Medicinal cannabis products are regulated as medicines in Australia. Medicines are not generally made available on the PBS to treat conditions for which they have not been approved for use in Australia by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). This is important because the PBS listing process relies in part on the assessment of quality, safety and efficacy that serves as the basis for TGA registration.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA provides safe and legal access to medicinal cannabis in appropriate circumstances. Sativex® (nabiximols) is registered by the TGA for moderate to severe multiple sclerosis, but is currently not listed on the PBS. Epidyolex® (cannabidiol) is registered by the TGA for seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome and is also PBS-listed for these indications.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, most medicinal cannabis products are 'unapproved', but the TGA can permit any medical practitioner to prescribe an unapproved medicinal cannabis product for an individual patient, through the Special Access B Scheme.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, under the Authorised Prescriber Scheme, a suitably authorised doctor can prescribe products without obtaining patient-by-patient approvals from the TGA.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A pharmaceutical company is a private entity that makes its own decisions about availability, pricing of its medicines in the private market (outside the PBS), and whether it will apply for PBS subsidy. The Government cannot compel companies to apply for TGA registration or PBS listing.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Patients and treating doctors can contact companies responsible for 'approved' and 'unapproved' medicinal cannabis products, to ask if they will consider submitting applications for particular medical conditions. Specific medicinal cannabis products and company names are available at www.tga.gov.au/medicinal-cannabis-products-active-ingredients.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Office of Drug Control also publishes a comprehensive list of Australian medicinal cannabis manufacturers and suppliers licensed under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Narcotic Drugs Act 1967. </span>This list (with company contact details) is available at www.odc.gov.au/manufacturers-and-suppliers-medicinal-cannabis-products.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While speaking with any pharmaceutical company, patients or treating doctors can ask if access to the medicine is available at reduced cost, through a compassionate access program. Decisions about these programs are a matter for each pharmaceutical company. Treating doctors can also apply to the drug and therapeutics committee of the local public hospital to seek assistance with cost. Private health insurers are also free to pay benefits under general treatment cover for the full price of a medicine, noting this is a commercial decision for each health insurer.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Medicines not on the PBS are dispensed as private prescriptions and patient charges for private prescriptions are a matter for each pharmacy to determine. As price competition applies to medicines not available on the PBS, I encourage patients to discuss the price of private prescriptions with their pharmacist, including if they have found a cheaper price elsewhere.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For people experiencing chronic pain, information is available on the Pain Australia website at www.painaustralia.org.au. Some patients who experience pain find it helpful to contact the Pain Link telephone helpline on 1300 340 357, which is staffed by volunteers with personal experience of pain.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All aspects of patient care, including recommendations about appropriate treatments and interpretation of PBS eligibility and access, are the responsibility of the patient's treating doctor.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">
                <span style="font-weight:bold;">
                </span>Thank you for your email regarding petition PN0593 on the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has an enduring commitment to a world without nuclear weapons. Prime Minister Albanese and I have made clear this commitment, and Australia continues to work with the international community to reduce the risk of nuclear weapons. This work is underpinned by a fundamental recognition of the devastating humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is steadfast in its support for the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) as the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament regime. The best pathway to advance nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament is to ensure that the NPT is acted upon and progressed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government shares the petition's concerns about nuclear testing, including in our region. The Government will continue to champion the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test Ban Treaty to ensure nuclear weapons testing is relegated to history. Australia was pleased to support a United Nations Resolution <span style="font-style:italic;">Addressing the legacy of nuclear weapons: providing victim assistance and environmental remediation to Member States affected by the use or testing of nuclear weapons </span>adopted on 22 December 2023.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While Australia is not a State Party to the TPNW, the Australian Government shares the Treaty's ambition of a world without nuclear weapons and is committed to engaging constructively to identify possible pathways towards disarmament. The Government continues to monitor the TPNW's progress including its interaction with the NPT, the adequacy of the TPNW's verification and enforcement architecture, and how States Parties will work to achieve universal support for the TPNW. I thank you for your own contribution to this engagement through your representation of Australia as an observer at the TPNW Meetings of States Parties in 2022 and 2023.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As a non-nuclear-weapon state, Australia does not have and will not seek nuclear weapons. AUKUS does not change that. Our acquisition of conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines will meet the highest non-proliferation standard, including through International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards oversight and verification. As I have stated publicly, Australia has legal commitments not to acquire, possess or have control over nuclear weapons, under the NPT and Treaty of Rarotonga.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Yours sincerely </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 12 February 2024 on behalf of 78 signatories regarding Petition EN5572, which calls for the formation of an independent inquiry or commission into bias in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's (ABC) selection and broadcast of political interviewees and commentators as part of its news broadcasting.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The ABC is an essential service and is a trusted source of news, information and entertainment for all Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In the face of political, social and economic instability at home and abroad, we must ensure that Australia's instruments of nation building, democracy and culture remain strong now and into the future. This includes independent public service media that holds power to account on behalf of the Australian people.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the Australian Government provides an overall level of funding to the ABC, the Australian Parliament has guaranteed the broadcaster's independence so that its editorial decisions can be free from political interference.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The ABC's independence is enshrined in legislation but the ABC remains accountable through complaints processes, its annual reports, government audits and inquiries, and appearances before Parliament, including Senate Estimates.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There are also a number of avenues to raise concerns about broadcast content.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In August 2022, the ABC Board introduced a new ABC Ombudsman role. The Ombudsman reports to the ABC Board and the Ombudsman's Office includes an investigations team which is separate to, and independent of, the ABC content making areas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">As has been provided to Ukrainians who arrived in Australia on visitor visas, the Australian Government has ensured people from significantly affected areas of the Occupied Palestinian Territories and Israel, who arrived on a temporary visa, may apply for an initial 12-month Bridging E visa (BVE). The BVE provides access to Medicare, work rights and provides a safety net if standard visa pathways are unable to be accessed.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Anyone who has arrived in Australia as a result of the ongoing conflict in the Occupied Palestinian Territories or Israel is not limited to one visa pathway. Everyone's situation is different, and the Department of Home Affairs strongly recommends people consider their own circumstances when applying for the visa that best suits them. There are a wide range of visa options across Australia's migration and visa programs that provide avenues for people to apply for family, skilled, humanitarian and temporary stay in Australia.</span>

This website has been updated to include the first round of funding, of $12.25 million, for which funding processes commenced on 1 February 2024. Details on future funding rounds under the $25 million package will be published on the Department's website as they become available.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 12 February 2024 enclosing Petition PN0587, with 63 signatures, concerning Visa Reinstatement of a former long term Australian Resident.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you may be aware, Home Affairs Portfolio Ministers have personal intervention powers under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Migration Act 1958, </span>which allow them to grant a visa to a person in immigration detention, or to make a residence determination to allow them to reside in the community at a specified address and under specified conditions, if they think it is the public interest to do so. The powers are non-compellable, that is, the Ministers are not required to exercise, or consider exercising their powers. Further, what is in the public interest is a matter for the Minister to determine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government takes seriously its responsibility to protect the Australian community from the risk of harm posed by non-citizens who engage in criminal conduct. In circumstances where the visa holder breaches a visa condition or engages in criminal activity or conduct of concern, their visa may be considered for cancellation. A non-citizen may fail the character requirements for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, if they have a substantial criminal record or sexually based offences involving a child.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Telecommunications</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 22 February 2024, regarding Petition (PN0589), requesting support in lobbying Telstra to improve its telecommunications network in the area of Texas, and surrounding suburbs, Queensland.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I understand the concerns raised in the petition and the need for regional communities, such as Texas, to have access to reliable mobile services, particularly during emergencies. Following your correspondence, the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts contacted Telstra for advice on mobile coverage in the Texas area.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Telstra advised that no issues were identified with the actual mobile coverage footprint in the area of Texas. However, the site servicing the area is congested at times and this translates to a slower user experience, exacerbated during peak times. Telstra is looking to address this issue with a project in place to improve capacity at the site. At this stage, Telstra does not have a timeframe of when the upgrade will be completed. Residents may wish to contact Telstra directly on the Texas site upgrade and on any other issue or concerns they may have about their mobile coverage in the area.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Regarding current mobile coverage in the area, the mobile network operators (MNOs) have products available to improve mobile reception including the use of an external antenna or authorised repeaters. Wi-Fi calling is also available on the mobile carriers' networks for use with a compatible device, allowing some customers to call and text over a broadband Wi-Fi connection. This can be particularly helpful in areas that have poor indoor coverage by providing an alternative form of connectivity. Texas residents can obtain accessories and advice on the best solution by contacting their service provider or visiting their nearest mobile phone shop or recognised dealer.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I also encourage residents to contact the Regional Tech Hub (the Tech Hub). Funded by the Government, the Tech Hub provides free, independent advice and will be able to help troubleshoot any specific issues and explore potential solutions, including Wi-Fi calling. The Tech Hub may be contacted on 1300 081 029 or via the website at www.regionaltechhub.org.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I would like to reassure the Texas community that the Australian Government is committed to increasing connectivity, bridging the digital divide, improving mobile coverage and protecting communities against natural disaster.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To this end, the Government is investing $2.2 billion in regional connectivity through the Better Connectivity Plan for Regional and Rural Australia (Better Connectivity Plan). This includes dedicated funding to boost mobile coverage and resilience, and for place-based connectivity solutions under new rounds of the Regional Connectivity Program. More information on the Better Connectivity Plan is available at www.infrastructure.gov.au/bcp.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Councils and communities, such as those in Texas are strongly encouraged to engage with the MNOs and mobile network infrastructure providers (MNIPs) to explore opportunities to improve mobile coverage through government funded initiatives. Experience has shown that when local communities and councils engage with the MNOs and MNIPs it increases the likelihood of issues being addressed or an application being put forward for co-funding under Government programs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Ultimately however, any investment in new mobile network infrastructure remains a commercial decision for Telstra and the other MNOs, and the Government cannot direct an MNO or MNIP to invest in new mobile network infrastructure.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I can also understand your concerns regarding access to mobile reception for emergency calls. As part of effective emergency preparation and planning, it is strongly recommended that people utilise a range of communications and sources of information in an emergency situation to ensure they stay aware of local conditions. This could include fixed line telephone, mobile services (including Wi-Fi calling), internet, television and radio. For example, during emergency situations people can listen to ABC Local Radio to receive up to date warnings. A portable transistor radio with a spare set of batteries can provide a valuable backup in the event there is a loss of mains power.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing the petitioners' concerns to my attention and I trust this information is of assistance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Yours sincerely </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today it's a privilege to introduce the Keeping Cash Transactions in Australia Bill 2024.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has the support of many constituents in the Calare electorate and Australians around our great country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also introduce it with the support of the member for Kennedy, who has had a long interest in this vitally important national issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This groundbreaking legislation preserves the use of cash in our national economy. It's the result of many constituents in the Calare electorate contacting me to express their concerns and fears that the use of cash for transactions in our country is being phased out and will soon disappear.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's true that the use of cash for transactions in Australia has been declining.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the Reserve Bank of Australia 2022 consumer payments survey, the ongoing decline in cash use in Australia has accelerated since the 2019 pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The share of in-person transactions made with cash halved from 32 per cent to 16 per cent over the three years to 2022.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The overall value of cash transactions stood at 13 per cent in 2022, also a decline.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Against this backdrop of the declining use of cash, constituents like Margaret Reid of Gulgong point out that many senior Australians are worried that businesses will soon refuse to accept cash for payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians like Margaret are right to be worried because while section 36(1) of the Reserve Bank Act 1959 provides that banknotes are legal tender, and the Currency Act 1965 provides that coins are legal tender, there is no legal requirement for banknotes or coins to be accepted for transactions in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission points out that businesses can choose what types of payment they will accept for a transaction as long as they make customers aware of this before the transaction takes place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In other words, carrying Australian banknotes, legal tender, is no guarantee that you'll be able complete a purchase in cash. It's at the discretion of the business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Keeping Cash Transactions in Australia Bill 2024 will remedy this by legislating that businesses operating in face-to-face settings must offer to accept and, crucially, must accept cash payments for transactions that do not exceed $10,000.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill provides for maximum civil penalties of $5,000 for individuals and $25,000 for companies. It should be noted that they are civil penalties as opposed to criminal penalties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also provides some important and practical exemptions to these requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They include that offering to accept cash would:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">that it would be contrary to another law of the Commonwealth or a law of a state or territory;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">that it would be contrary to the Commonwealth state or territory health advice—such as advice provided during a pandemic;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Bullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Bullet">or that cash in the form of change is needed but not readily available.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of our seniors have been calling for this legislation to protect the use of cash.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The RBA found that Australians over the age of 65 are the heaviest users of cash. Pensioners such as Max and Fay Gregory of the Calare electorate have told me that for many older Australians, cash is not just a convenience—it's a lifeline. In these times of economic uncertainty and rising costs, cash is an essential tool for managing finances and sticking to a budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many senior Australians simply do not want to use cards for their transactions. Not everyone is able to use online banking services. Many find managing accounts and cards online to be stressful, and confusing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Cash is often used in rural areas by individuals who do not have ready access to banking services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Max and Fay fear that if they are forced to switch to cards, they will face additional fees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They make a very good point. Many Australians are now understanding that banks and financial institutions charge merchant fees for card transactions, which can then be passed on to consumers. It's an insidious tax that is added to transactions just for tapping a card.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been estimated that Australians are losing about $1 billion a year in surcharges when they pay by cards and not cash.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It must be said that many businesses don't like those merchant fees and surcharges either.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And, as a crucial matter, we must consider the practicalities of internet connectivity. In many regional and rural areas, reliable internet access does not exist. Cash remains a dependable means of exchange that does not rely on electricity or internet access.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Cash transactions are unaffected by digital failures. During natural disasters like fires or floods, connectivity can be disrupted for many days, sometimes longer, rendering electronic payments unusable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said, some Australians prefer cash as a means of managing their budgets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Others worry about privacy and the risk of fraud associated with using cards. Many Australians have been the victim of fraud and unauthorised transactions relating to cards and the accounts linked to them. I know I have been.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Privacy is another reason that some Australians prefer to use cash over cards. Some people just don't want corporations knowing every single thing they buy. And that should be their choice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another constituent, Daniel Belshaw, also wrote to my office expressing his alarm over the phasing out of cash transactions, and he worries about the consequences for children's financial literacy. He believes the use of cash can assist in teaching valuable lessons about budgeting, making choices and understanding the value of money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is not about imposing burdensome regulations on businesses. It's about striking a balance between innovation and inclusivity. It's about preserving the essence of choice in our financial transactions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Keeping Cash Transactions in Australia Bill is all about freedom—the freedom for Australians to choose how they will pay for transactions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not a choice that should be made for them by financial institutions or businesses. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge all members of this House to support this game-changing bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KATTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:21</span>):  Yes. I take great pleasure in seconding the motion on this bill, the Keeping Cash Transactions in Australia Bill 2024. Where I come from, we have firsthand knowledge of going two weeks without electricity after a cyclone. During most cyclones we lose electricity. We're at the end of the carrying line for the electricity, so we have no relay protection, and on numerous occasions, again and again, our little towns are caught out. Famous race meetings, like the races at Borroloola, often lose their ability to use cards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the real essence of this bill is: do you want your bank manager to decide whether or not you can buy a loaf of bread? There is no doubt that we're running pell-mell into some sort of dystopian society in which a handful of people control every aspect of our lives. I repeat: do you realise that, if you eliminate cash, you will have to get the permission of your bank manager to buy a loaf of bread? There would be few people in this country who haven't at some time or other got offside with their bank manager. And he might think it's good not to cash your cheques or allow you to use your card.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was appointed Aboriginal affairs minister in Queensland, the first question I got in every community was: 'Can we get the right to cash our socials?'—their social security payments. That's because the director of the department was using it as a control mechanism to terrify every single person, 70,000 or 80,000 people, living in the community areas in Queensland. I can tell you that, if they were terrified, the rest of you are going to have the wind put right up you if you move into this area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

You are obliged to take that banknote, as you yourself, Mr Speaker, and I advised the refectory in this place. To spell it out boldly and bluntly without any equivocation: it's absolutely necessary. I commend the member for Calare for bringing this bill forward. It is definitely something for which the time has arrived. It is an imperative assertion of freedom and an underlying principle of our freedom—that is, the right to purchase something. If that right is taken off us and given to the banks then the freedoms in this country have ceased to exist and <span style="font-style:italic;">Nineteen Eighty-Four</span> has arrived upon us.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge the efforts of the previous Social Policy and Legal Affairs Committee, of which I was the chair, and I want to acknowledge the shadow minister for communications, who's sitting at the table. He was also the minister for mental health in the former government. There is a lot of discussion, at the moment, around social media. Mr Speaker, you, quite rightly, threw me out of question time last Thursday because I saw red when the Prime Minister was spruiking what the Labor Party were doing in relation to social media protections. This government has sat on its hands for two years and fought us every step of the way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The shadow minister for communications and I stood up here in November when he moved a private member's bill to introduce age verification for social media, online gambling and porn, and those opposite rejected it. They fought us every step of the way. Now, without justification, some six or seven months later, they're standing up and crowing about all of these wonderful things that they purport that they're going to do in relation to protecting young people online. They've only done this because parents in Australia have mobilised. They have prepared petitions. Tens of thousands of people have signed these petitions calling on this government to get its act together in relation to social media. They have now finally made a political decision to do something, but, when we start scratching away at the surface of what this government plans to do in relation to age verification, it looks about as useful as—I probably need to be careful what I say. But, when we scratch away at the surface, we can see that there are a lot of holes in what the communications minister intends to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to identity verification, I was also chair of the Social Policy and Legal Affairs Committee. The good member behind me, the member for Grey, was also on that committee and did some great work on that committee. Domestic violence is a scourge in our community—an absolute scourge—and social media has a significant part to play. But, once again, the government is left wanting. Once again, the opposition has to drag this government kicking and screaming to implement anything in relation to safeguards—in this case, particularly for women who are being abused by their partners or former partners online. This is inexcusable. The member for Jagajaga was also a part of that committee. What we came up with as a committee was a recommendation that, if you want a social media account, you need to be identifiable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some people are going to find this very uncomfortable. One of the biggest problems we have with social media is anonymity. If you hide behind anonymity, you can say whatever you like without fear of being sued for defamation or having the police knock on your door. The identification of people who use social media accounts is as important as age verification. If you threaten someone on social media, if you threaten a partner or a former partner, don't you think they should be able to go to the police and say: 'Here's his Facebook account. Here's what he has said to me on social media'? I would have thought that would have been a relatively uncontroversial statement, an uncontroversial principle, but yet again this government is asleep at the wheel, and yet again it continues to be dragged kicking and screaming in relation to introducing social media reform.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to continue to work with our shadow minister, the shadow minister for communications, to hold the government to account, to implement the recommendations of both the <span style="font-style:italic;">Protecting </span><span style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span style="font-style:italic;">he </span><span style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ge </span><span style="font-style:italic;">o</span><span style="font-style:italic;">f </span><span style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nnocence</span> report and our domestic violence report.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion that has been put forward and the suggestion made by those opposite is dangerous in the sense it is taking the issue of age assurance beyond what was ever recommended by the eSafety Commissioner. It also suggests that one recommendation would stop all online abuse, family and domestic violence and abuse, and it's just not the case. The motion is suggesting all users of social media, social engines and other digital platforms should provide identification documentation to big tech. I want to highlight this point to the member opposite, who, as somebody in this place who voted against the government's proposal, the digital ID, is now suggesting that big tech should be the keepers and the holders of 100 points of identification not just for adults but for minors. We're talking about input age verification and proof-of-age documents—including birth certificates, including licences—to platforms like TikTok. I wonder what Senator Paterson would say about the member's motion! TikTok, Facebook/Meta and Twitter/X would all require that 100 points of identification. Will they store it properly? There are complications with that recommendation which the government is methodically working through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My real disappointment is the way in which the member opposite has tried to use this motion to completely ignore what we are doing to combat the scourge of family and domestic violence. The government is moving forward in this area, and a number of measures have already been introduced and are being worked on. Particularly in this area, the government has announced it will fund an age assurance trial. The reason it's a trial is to make sure we get the technology right. Its purpose is to prevent minors from accessing online pornography—which is illegal to minors, but they are still accessing it. It will examine how age limits for social media can be better implemented.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is addressing family, domestic and sexual violence through delivering its National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children. This isn't something that appeared in the member's motion. It is addressing the role of pornography and social media in contributing to harmful social behaviours and reinforcing stereotypes and attitudes towards children and women amongst adults, children and young people. The Albanese government is building on the work of the eSafety Commissioner with better support for individuals who are experiencing technology-facilitated abuse. The point I want to make on this is that, if you are a perpetrator of violence against women, you do it anonymously and you do it just with your own account. That is the reality of the situation we are in. People will use their own accounts. They will use their friends' accounts if they want to perpetrate violence. And that is why we cannot single out one—let's just get rid of anonymous. It doesn't stop family and domestic violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember back in the late nineties and early eighties there was this group in Melbourne called the Black Shirts, and they would harass women and their children who had left family and domestic violence. They'd letterbox the neighbourhood, they'd turn up with loudspeakers and they'd harass women who took the brave step of leaving. You don't need 100 points of verification to jump on a megaphone, so to suggest that this one recommendation solves all the problems is really unfair and irrational. In conclusion, this is a complex issue that needs action. That is why this government is implementing the National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms McKENZIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:36</span>):  I'll start my remarks on this motion by making some observations about the member who moved it. The member for Fisher is one of the true gentlemen in this place—of great intellect and even greater patience. He tackles our society's challenges with curiosity, empathy and a determination shown by few—certainly shown by few on the other side. In this particular area of policy the member for Fisher has been dogged, pushing for reform from the time the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, which he chaired in the 46th parliament, delivered its report <span style="font-style:italic;">Protecting </span><span style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span style="font-style:italic;">he </span><span style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ge </span><span style="font-style:italic;">o</span><span style="font-style:italic;">f </span><span style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nnocence</span> back in March 2020. The member for Fisher and I have become firm friends and collaborators on this topic and the related topic of the danger social media poses as a method of radicalisation and extremism, as well as a vector for foreign interference—matters we considered together in another place as members of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For all the fine attributes and intelligence of the member for Fisher, it should come as no surprise that he grew up in the great electorate of Flinders, and that he has the good sense to be furthering the high quality of the Wallace family gene pool in Flinders, with the first grandchild recently born there. Our future is safe in Flinders with young Finley.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Protecting </span><span style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span style="font-style:italic;">he </span><span style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ge </span><span style="font-style:italic;">o</span><span style="font-style:italic;">f </span><span style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nnocence</span> report recommended the introduction of identity verification for social media and other internet platforms from which our children should be protected, including pornography. It's a topic on which this side of the parliament has been persistent for some time. The member for Fisher has raised it many times, to the point of being thrown out of the chamber for his persistence. The shadow minister, the member for Banks, has been just as forthright, introducing the Online Safety Amendment (Protecting Australian Children from Online Harm) Bill 2023 to conduct a trial of age verification technologies—a bill which was ignored by this Albanese government until they realised—all too late—they had a crisis on their hands.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I delivered my maiden speech almost two years ago, I spoke about the impact of technology on young minds. I reflected on both the good and the bad of gen Z's extraordinary digital dexterity and how their smart toys had opened up the world's wisdom to their fingertips. But, having just come out of two years of COVID lockdowns, where we saw our children glued to their screens as their only means of communication with the outside world, it became rapidly clear that the digitisation of the developing minds—and, in particular, their daily disappearance down the social media rabbit hole—was sending our girls down a path to misery and our boys down a path to mediocrity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Fenner reminded me the other day that when social media began in 2007 it was but an extension of the phonebook; ways of finding each other, like a phonebook but with some photos. Somewhere around 2010 that all changed. The smart phone had put social media in our pockets 24/7, and then the social media platforms found ways of getting them out of our pockets and into our faces 24/7. Notifications, like buttons, shares, filters and follows all produce what the US academic and author Jonathan Haidt now calls 'the great rewiring of childhood'. Unwittingly, we have given our children the weapons of self-destruction: high-speed data plans, front-facing cameras, Instagram, Snapchat, Reddit, Discord and TikTok, among others. The trees they climbed have been replaced by the keys they tap. And, foolishly, we all think that they're safer because we can see them sitting there on the couch for eight hours a day with their necks permanently bent down to the screens. But they are not safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A few months ago, I asked Reset.tech to run an experiment for me to test how long it would take to get recommended systems or algorithms to recommend Andrew Tate content to someone who was just curious about Jordan Peterson. Reset.tech set up a new 17-year-old male's account on Instagram on a completely fresh handset with a new SIM installed. The Instagram account was clean, and there were no previous interactions or activity. The new account watched and liked 50 of the top Peterson posts and then scrolled through the content being recommended on Instagram Reels while continuing to watch and like posts containing Jordan Peterson. After 70 pieces of content, the fake 17-year-old boy's account was recommended a video of Andrew Tate. The content featuring Andrew Tate grew in frequency over the duration of the experiment. Of the last 30 pieces of content that Reset.tech examined, 29 featured Andrew Tate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This experiment took under two hours to complete, meaning that a teenage boy showing an interest in the work of Jordan Peterson would encounter Andrew Tate within about an hour. If that teenage boy then watches or likes the Andrew Tate content by the two-hour mark, the system will almost exclusively feed him Tate content. So we can see that as our sons or daughters sit on the couch, heads down on social media, they're anything but safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do congratulate this government for setting up the Joint Select Committee on Social Media and Australian Society, but, as the member for Fisher said, 'By golly, they were brought to it kicking and screaming,' and much too late.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms THWAITES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:41</span>):  Thank you to the member for Fisher for raising this motion. I know that these are issues he has been concerned about for a long time and that he has been working on for a long time. Unfortunately, we didn't see much action on these really important issues from the previous Liberal-National government during their 10 years in office, so there is a lot of work to be done. Indeed, I would hope that all members in this place recognise that there are serious harms associated with social media platforms, including where perpetrators of domestic and family violence lurk. There's vital work to be done to ensure that we reduce the harms associated with the use of social media, and, unlike the previous Liberal-National government, our government is up to the challenge. We see the challenge of technology facilitated abuse, and we are working on it on a number of fronts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have provided $16.6 million in funding to the eSafety Commissioner, providing a team of experts to support victims-survivors of technology facilitated abuse, and we're extending the National Online Safety Awareness campaign to help protect Australian women from severe online abuse, including the sharing of explicit images without consent, illegal and violent content, and severe harassment and threats. We're funding an age-assurance trial to prevent minors from accessing online pornography, and we're examining how age limits for social media can be better implemented. Just this week, the Attorney-General announced new laws to ensure that people who share deepfake pornography face serious issues. So there are a number of fronts on which we're working on this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This isn't a challenge that Australia is grappling with alone. Governments and communities worldwide are trying to find a way through from what, essentially, has been a Wild West of online social media platforms being allowed to do what they want to regulating them in a way which regulates harmful behaviours with appropriate controls and safeguards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to get the policy settings right for all Australians. Social media platforms, deservedly, should be held to account for their role in all of this. We need to act thoroughly and effectively, and we also need to make sure, as part of that action, that we aren't exposing people, especially young people, to privacy risks. There are risks with big tech being provided with someone's identity and private data. We know, certainly, that big tech do not have a good track record in protecting people who use their platforms. In fact, they're much more likely to spread data to places that people have no idea about than they are to protect it. Of course, we have a number of foreign companies involved in this space particularly, and there's a lot of discussion in this parliament, especially by those opposite, about the owners of TikTok being based in China. So we have to acknowledge the harm, but we have to do the work thoroughly, because we do not want to expose people, especially young Australians, to further harm at the hands of big tech companies which are just looking to make a quick buck from them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I look forward to working with the member for Fisher and the member for Flinders and other members of the parliament as part of the new inquiry our government has initiated into the influence and impacts of social media on Australian society, which I will chair. Our inquiry will seek to hear from a range of experts as well as media and social media outlets, but importantly we will also get feedback from a wide range of Australians about the role that social media plays in their lives and the need to address the harms that we are seeing. We are clear that the way social media operates in Australia right now cannot continue as it has been. We need to see change for all Australians. We need to have a safer online environment, including for young people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I really hope and expect that we can do that work in a way that works across this parliament to protect Australians, without hurling inflammatory language and accusations at each other, actually recognising that it is our duty to work together to protect Australians and young Australians and to hold big tech to account for the harms that they have too long washed their hands of, to look to how we build better online spaces and places. This is work that falls on all of us in this parliament. It is best done constructively, without insulting each other.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a lot still to be done. There is a lot of work underway. The role that social media is playing in our society and others is rightly being put under a microscope right now. I look forward, through the inquiry that we will have, to bringing together experts and other Australians to find a way through, to prepare for a reasonable, implementable way to protect Australians from social and online media harm.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="72184" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GILLESPIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:46</span>):  This motion by the member for Fisher is very important—in fact, one of the more important private member's motions that have come to this chamber. Identity verification is the root issue—and the need to install it into social media. Social media is an essential evil, almost. It's part of life now. We all have horror stories of what happens on social media to young people, naive people, old people. There are scammers. There are people who used to be burglars at night or violent offenders in the general public. They are the highwaymen of the digital age. They prey on the assumption that they are never identified as the real perpetrator, so identity verification is everything. The rule of law depends on identity. If you don't know who is doing something wrong, how do you sue them or put them in jail or charge them? It is fundamental. How do legal titles exist unless, at the end of the chain of legal titles, you have a real person? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Identity is everything, and identity verification on social media is key to stopping all the social media ills that we're all familiar with. We operate in that field, as active politicians, and we've had to identify ourselves and go through lots of hoops to convince Facebook and Instagram that we are real people. If it can be done for us, why isn't it done for everyone on social media? We need to get into the social media space—not through the eSafety Commissioner; this should be an international movement. We can do our bit, but, as we have all seen, our eSafety Commissioner is like a mosquito bite to social media giant companies. They just brush us off. Admittedly, we can do stuff within our digital boundaries—geolocking—but we need to get identity confirmed so that we can defend our young people, older people and naive people from scammers, grifters, people grooming children, child abusers, violent offenders and the mid-African scammers, who seem to have a field day in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has been alleged by several speakers that we did nothing about this. We put up a committee of inquiry into this very issue and made many recommendations. In an attempt to prevent technology facilitated abuse, the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, in 2021, did recommend the introduction of identity verification for social media platforms to strip malicious actors of their anonymity. We have now the emergence of artificial intelligence. That is yet another critical issue that will make everyone vulnerable if the person getting the fake persona on social media isn't verified.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Deputy Speaker Freelander, you could appear in an AI generated video soon, as could senators in this building. You don't just have to be highly known actors or billionaires to get scammed. Everyone could scam anyone if we don't have proof of identity. We have the technology. We can't say it's too hard or too difficult. We have this thing—blockchain. Why can't we all get a digital blockchain badge that we have to submit to social media so that users know if we're a real person? Then they'll know you are a real person. Unless we really get more technologically advanced than blockchain, we should be able to have a way of making it quick and easy without displaying all our details. It's just that rubber stamp: yes, that's a real person. A lot of these problems will then vanish because, if you're known and you're saying outrageous, libellous stuff or you're running a scam, people can track you down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a really important issue. I'd like to thank the member for Fisher for putting it up. We want our children to be safe on social media. We've got to realise that, for kids, social media is not your friend. Wait till you grow up. Like driving and voting and serving your country, you have to be over a certain age.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="245392" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GOSLING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:51</span>):  I think we all, in this place, want to protect our kids from online harm. So, when members opposite say that that's not the case or suggest that they're morally superior, it brings them some deep shame. I'm so happy to hear that my friend and colleague the member for Jagajaga is going to be chairing an inquiry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition, through this private member's motion, are taking the issue of age assurance to a dangerous extent—well beyond the recommendations of the eSafety Commission, the experts in the field. They are suggesting that all users of social search engines and other digital platforms should provide identity documents to big tech. We know this because the member himself, when chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs in 2021, recommended the introduction of identity verification for social media platforms. This has the potential to require children—minors under the age of 18—to use their birth certificates to access the internet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition's approach has serious implications for minors' privacy. It enables big tech to access our children's private identity information. I'm confident that my constituents in Solomon will not want their children providing this sort of information to big tech.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government continues to address these issues in a coherent and integrated way rather than by relying on dangerous, broadbrush identification processes. The government has funded an age assurance trial with the express purpose of preventing minors from accessing online pornography. We are committed to trialling technologies for age assurance that are effective, that meet community standards around use and privacy and that can be enforced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government has also committed to addressing family, domestic and sexual violence through the delivery of the national plan to end violence against women. This plan includes key actions that address the issues raised in this motion, including the following: addressing the role of pornography and social media in contributing to harmful sexual behaviours and reinforcing stereotyped attitudes among adults, children and young people; and building on the work of the eSafety Commissioner to better support individuals when they experience technology facilitated abuse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Fisher and the coalition, those opposite, through this motion are saying that social media companies should require all users, including minors, to input age verification or proof-of-age documentation to establish and maintain a social media account, regardless of age. This ignores the government's response to the inquiry into family, domestic and sexual violence and makes online safety a partisan issue. Keeping our communities safe online in an effective way should be the priority of all members of this House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A great example of the coherent and integrated approach of the Albanese government is the Stop it at the Start initiative. A new phase of Stop it at the Start will launch in mid-June and run until May next year. This new phase will be a counterinfluencing campaign in online spaces where violent and misogynistic content thrives to directly challenge the material in the spaces it's being viewed. The campaign aims to counter the corrosive influence of online content targeted at young adults that condones violence against women, raise awareness about a proliferation of misogynistic influencers and content and really encourage conversations within families about the damaging impact of the material.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Popularised negative and misogynistic voices are rising in support and influencing younger people, predominantly males, on digital platforms where adults and the government are not engaged. Recent research has indicated that around 25 per cent of teenage boys in Australia look up to social media personalities who perpetuate harmful gender stereotypes and condone violence against women. The marked contextual shift has driven a significant knowledge and understanding gap for adults and a generational divide in how Australians feel and experience disrespect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important that we have evidence based policy as part of a systematic approach to address digital safety and domestic violence in our community rather than trying to wedge it as a partisan issue.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="291387" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAMILTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:56</span>):  I will begin my comments by thanking the member for Fisher for raising this motion. It is important. It does speak to so many issues that are coming to the forefront of the national conversation today as we look across this nation to the level of lawlessness and social discord that we haven't seen for years. It is tearing at the fabric of our society and it's causing a lot of people concern and grief.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I really want to thank the member for Fisher for is not what he is doing today but what he has done over a long period in this place on committees. He's been speaking on bills like this for a prolonged period of time. He's been advocating on this issue that's been important to him and that's been important to his community. His community and the people of Australia need to know. If you're concerned about these issues, if you're worried about what's happening online, if you think your kids are getting exposed material they shouldn't be, if you think your kids are responding or reacting to pressures that they shouldn't be experiencing, it's important that you know that people like the member for Fisher and others have actually stood up on this and they've done something about it. I thank him for it. It's been an important contribution to this place over a long period of time. It's a difficult conversation, to talk to young men about the impact of pornography and violent imagery on their mobile phones and on social media. He's been willing to have it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I raise this because, so often when the member for Fisher has been advocating for change in this area, he hasn't had support. I have to push back. This is such an important issue facing the country at the moment. I'm not going to launch into attacks, but I will point out that under the last term of government there were significant changes to the Online Safety Act. There was the establishment of the eSafety Commissioner. There were steps taken forward to address this issue. Unfortunately, far too many times this place, bipartisanship means us supporting Labor when they're in government. But their support was not there on age verification. It was not there when the member for Fisher was raising it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to raise another issue that is very relevant to this motion today, and that's the impact of social media in spreading violent images and acts of violence and crime amongst young children. This was something that was raised with me by a local community group in Toowoomba who had seen far too often, as we saw growing crime in our community, something that was new for us to experience, that what sat behind it was a recording of these crimes on social media. Not only was it an affront for people to have their possessions taken from them; unfortunately, we also saw theft move into violent crimes such as assaults and, in some cases, now murder cases going through the courts. All was recorded on social media.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What was confronting was that people would have these things happen to them and then someone would show them the video clip on TikTok, Instagram or Facebook of the crime being committed. That was confronting, but what was worse was that we were finding copycat videos being produced by younger kids. These videos were coming out and they weren't just direct videos. These were videos with the crime being committed, with great graphics, with pumping soundtracks, making this life of crime look attractive. Unfortunately, to some very vulnerable people in our community, it did look attractive. They perpetuated this cycle of violence, so younger and younger kids were seeing this and getting involved. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I raised this in the parliament—I brought my private member's bill in March 2023—and I wrote to the Minister for Communications, asking her to address it and saying this was happening and was going out of control, the response in the statement was, 'If you come across material you think goes against the terms of service of a platform, you should report it to the platform in the first instance and, if it isn't removed, you can make a report to the eSafety Commissioner.' Nothing to see here. Nothing wrong at all. We didn't need to make a single change back then, because it wasn't on the front page. It wasn't in the national conversation. It wasn't popular to talk about then, so dismiss it and walk away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, what's happened since that time is these crimes have got worse and worse. They've spread right across our community and they are unavoidable now. The minister has to act. Member for Fisher, you stood there all the way through. Congratulations for your conviction.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I share with you, Deputy Speaker Freelander, and the House more broadly a transformative vision for our nation's future—a vision grounded in support for our families, our small businesses, health care more broadly, building infrastructure and educating our people, whether they be the tiniest of tots or those who want to turn their hand to a trade later in life. It is all so vital to making our economy more productive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the heart of this vision is a commitment to easing the financial burdens that we know Australians are feeling at the moment, and that starts with a good budget and, importantly, meaningful tax cuts. On 1 July this year, the Albanese Labor government will deliver a tax cut for every Australian taxpayer. I just want to say that again. The Albanese government, on 1 July this year, will deliver a tax cut for every Australian taxpayer. If you pay tax, it will be cut. In my seat of Paterson, that means 75,000 hardworking Australians are going to get, on average, around $1,500 tax back. That is such an exciting prospect, and I know that, for everyone who's ever had to do a family budget or a personal budget, let alone a budget for a nation, every dollar counts. That's why the Albanese government wants to make sure you get every dollar you can for your hard work in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It also means that 65,000 people in my electorate, around 87 per cent of the electorate, are going to be better off under Labor's plans because we had the courage to revisit the tax. That's what we've done, and that's going to be the rub for all people who are earning and paying tax in Paterson.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know our small businesses are the backbone of our economy, employing 5.2 million Australians across the nation and contributing more than $500 million annually. In Paterson, we've got 10,238 small businesses—give or take a few, thanks to the statistics of the day. They're driving local prosperity. Their owners are getting up early, they're going to bed late, they're doing their paperwork, they're employing other Australians and, apart from those things, they're making our local communities such vibrant places. People come up with the most brilliant ideas for small business these days and they're working hard to make those ideas a reality. I want to personally thank them for that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're implementing several key initiatives for small business, including energy bill relief. Starting on 1 July the Commonwealth will deliver rebates of $325 to approximately one million eligible small businesses—it's a small amount, but it's an important amount, and we know that every dollar counts in small business too—through the Energy Bill Relief Fund. This will significantly reduce operational costs for many businesses in Paterson. We're committing $3.1 million to extend support through the Small Business Debt Helpline, which assisted 1,232 small businesses in New South Wales last year, offering vital guidance and relief. In relation to mental health support, we know having a small business can really be something that you worry about day and night. We're investing $7.7 million to continue the NewAccess for Small Business Owners mental health program, supporting small business operators with free, specialised help. In 2023, 520 small business operators in New South Wales benefited from this program. It's things like this that are just so vitally important across the nation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also making historic investments to ensure the wellbeing and connectivity of our communities, and this goes to the heart of the NBN. Our $2.4 billion investment in the NBN has significantly improved internet speeds. In Paterson, we're going to be able to offer better speeds for over 35,000 businesses and households, and they'll have the ability to have access to full fibre. That's a game changer for business, as is this budget for our nation. I couldn't be prouder. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="286042" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SPENDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:07</span>):  Budgets are about the here and now. They're about addressing urgent priorities. Those urgent priorities are extremely clear—putting downward pressure on inflation and providing support to those who urgently need it. On inflation, I am significantly concerned that the budget did not deliver this downward pressure. But budgets are also about the long-term future, about setting up the country over time and ensuring we are good ancestors for future generations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is on the longer term I would like to focus today. What is that future vision of Australia? Australia is a wonderful country. We have a diverse and largely cohesive society, we are prosperous and we offer opportunities to many. We have, on the whole, good public services and we are blessed with wonderful natural resources. We have largely managed to balance competing interests, walking our own path between the breathtaking dynamism but punishing inequality of the US and the strong public services but, at times, sclerotic environments of Europe. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I think of that vision for the future of Australia, I think about building on those strong foundations with six key principles. Firstly, we want Australia to be the best place in the world to start and grow a business. Secondly, we want to be a place where all people and generations who work hard and make a contribution can build a comfortable life. Thirdly, we want to be a place where there's help at hand when you fall on hard times. Fourthly, we want to be a place which protects our natural environment whilst benefiting responsibly from its abundance. Fifthly, we want to be a place where everyone is valued and welcomed and where our differences and diversity enrich our society. Finally, we want to be a secure country which can chart our own course free of coercion. We're not very far away from those aspirations, but I recognise that these are very difficult times approaching us and this is a constantly dynamic environment. I believe we do need to take different actions to ensure that we continue to deliver on this vision of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me outline some of the areas where I think we should be focused. Firstly, we should be focusing on housing and intergenerational inequity. Crippling housing costs are Australia's economic cancer. They infect opportunities for our children, they prevent essential workers from living near where they work and they are devastating the lives of those who deserve better. I had a call recently with a senior teacher in my electorate—a deputy principal, no less—and she broke down in tears because of the cost of housing and how difficult she was finding it to make ends meet. It shouldn't be this way. Though many levers sit with the states, the Commonwealth must and can do more on housing, including providing stronger incentives for states to change planning laws and protect renters, reviewing our tax system in relation to housing in terms of both stamp duty and CGT, and supporting social housing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, if we want to fund the public services we all desire, we need to make it easier to start and grow a business here in Australia. That means cutting red tape, ensuring that public procurement supports innovative Australian companies, simplifying the industrial relations system and restoring competitiveness to our tax system. Thirdly, there needs to be more focus on public sector productivity. That means measuring what actually works, properly assessing the costs and benefits of big infrastructure projects and adopting a more customer-centric approach to government services. Fourth is transitioning to net zero at the lowest cost and as fast as possible, which means putting people and households at the centre and properly funding environmental protection. Fifth is investing for inclusiveness by sharing the caring, empowering women and ensuring that those who want to have a job have the resources and support to succeed at the interview. Finally, we need to be realistic about the strategic and defence environment we face. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where does this differ between the government and the opposition? With both, I support elements of their agendas, but I see both as significantly wanting. The government, I believe, must do more on business productivity and accountability. I support steps forward on the FIRB and the removal of nuisance tariffs, for example, but I don't see the drive to support businesses, and their IR agenda has made it harder. On public sector productivity, there's not enough rigour on public spending and analysis, particularly for infrastructure, and it is absolutely critical that we get this right. The government's moving on housing, but not fast enough. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition 's agenda is less clear at the moment, and, while I agree with them on things like industrial relations and reducing red tape, their responses to net zero transition, intergenerational inequity and supporting inclusiveness do not address the significant challenges we face. There is a different way to pursue a positive future, and we must do better. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300129" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:12</span>):  I thank the member for Paterson for moving this motion on the first sitting Monday we've had since the Treasurer handed down the Albanese Labor government's third budget—one that delivers for millions of Australians and delivers for my electorate of Spence. It was a budget that was calibrated to ease cost-of-living pressures faced by Australians in a measured and responsible way while not unduly adding to inflationary pressures at the same time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst we're in the process of transferring from those opposite the intellectual property rights to the use of 'responsible economic managers' and the rights to the resale of the 'back in black' coffee mugs, we are ready to deliver the first back-to-back consecutive budget surpluses in just shy of 20 years, which is no mean feat—unless you happen to occupy the benches on the other side of the chamber, where you can get away with simultaneously making the claims that we are not doing enough in cost-of-living relief and that the cost-of-living relief measures are going to cause inflation to skyrocket. These are the very same people who praised the previous government's spending during the pandemic yet feel as if they are absolved of the sins of both the rising inflation and the rising interest rates that followed them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a budget that delivers a tax cut for every single Australian taxpayer—all 13.6 million taxpayers. This contrasts with the plan of those opposite, who preferred to keep the bulk of their tax relief to just a select few near the top, excluding taxpayers near the bottom from any benefit from their tax plan entirely. Many of those forgotten by those opposite live in my electorate of Spence. In fact, 74,000 taxpayers in Spence will be receiving a tax cut. On average, this equates to a tax cut of over $1,217. Because they elected an Albanese Labor government, 91 per cent of taxpayers in Spence will be better off than if the coalition's tax plan had been allowed to remain in effect. If that were the case, each taxpayer in Spence would have been, on average, almost $500 worse off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is coupled with the $3.5 billion our government has put toward much-needed energy bill relief. Over 10 million households and one million small businesses across Australia will receive a rebate of $300 and $325 respectively.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget also looks to strengthen Medicare, making a trip to the doctor and a trip to the chemist cheaper. At the same time, this budget is making sure that pathology services for many common tests remain bulk-billed. Pathology services, that were accessed in Spence just shy of 175,000 times last year, will remain bulk-billed under this budget and under an Albanese Labor government. This is also the case for four MRI machines in Spence that will now have Medicare coverage, meaning that your ability to afford an MRI test shouldn't impact your ability to have one—the way it should be, where your Medicare card matters more than your credit card.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is expanding Medicare urgent care clinics to an additional 29 locations across the country. Not only does this mean that Australians are more likely to see a doctor when they need to, but this will help draw pressure from emergency rooms across the country. Australians will walk into the Medicare urgent care clinic and walk out after being bulk-billed. In my electorate of Spence, since the opening of the Elizabeth Medicare Urgent Care Clinic, they've seen 4,685 visits through their doors, and that number continues to climb with each passing week. One visit was in fact mine. When I needed to see a doctor after falling ill, I was able to walk in and see a doctor after a relatively short wait and get the care I needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government's third budget doesn't just ease cost-of-living pressures for millions of Australians but also sets them up for well-paying jobs in the future. Nine out of 10 new jobs over the next decade will require post-school qualifications, with 50 per cent of those requiring at least a bachelor's degree and 44 per cent requiring VET qualifications. Apprentices will be eligible for $5,000 to assist with supporting them to finish their training, a policy that will help nearly 2,000 apprentices in the northern suburbs of Spence. There are many policies our government has introduced in this budget in response to the Australian Universities Accord final report—policies like fee-free uni-ready courses to enable a pathway for tens of thousands of Australians to help them take that next step toward higher education all the way to our changes to the way HELP debt indexation is calculated. We have wiped $3 billion in student debt instantly, assisting 19,000 people in Spence with a HELP debt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As you can see, this is a budget that we can all be proud of—a Labor budget that delivers for all Australians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:17</span>):  I listened closely to the member for Wentworth talking about small business in her contribution. I note that just now the Fair Work Commission has awarded a 3.75 per cent pay rise to 2.6 million minimum wage and award-reliant workers. The cost of business is getting harder for those small business operators, for those employers, right across the country. In its annual wage decision, the full bench of the commission, headed by Adam Hatcher, the president, said that the increase factored in cost-of-living pressures felt by households.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know, right across this parliament and right across this nation, that there is a cost-of-living crisis. We know that Labor became aware of the cost-of-living crisis and started talking about it, moreover, on Monday 16 October last year. That was the first sitting day after the Voice—after the referendum which divided the nation. You didn't hear about a cost-of-living crisis whilst the Voice referendum was being debated across this country. Labor didn't want to know about it, and, if they did know about it, they weren't talking about it. But, all of a sudden, when the Voice was lost, Labor started to pretend it cared. We know Labor does not care about the cost-of-living pressures on households and on small businesses. All Labor cares about is getting re-elected.

                  </a>  In another contribution I certainly will tell you more! But I will say that people across this wide brown land are now poorer thanks to Labor and now feel less safe thanks to Labor; that is certainly the case. The cost of health has risen by nine per cent. The cost of food—every time you go to the supermarket, it's costing you 10 per cent more; you're getting less in the grocery trolley than you were previously when there was a coalition government. The cost of education is up 11 per cent. The cost of housing is up 12 per cent, and we've got construction companies across the nation going bankrupt, going out of business, just shutting up shop. It's hard to get a tradie. It's hard to get the supplies to build a house, yet Labor continues with getting more migrants in—and I'm not against that, but we need to do it in moderation. We need to do it sensibly. We need to do it such that there isn't the pressure on urban housing demand, because heaven knows they're not coming to the regions where, in many cases, most cases or all cases, they would be welcome and there are jobs for them—and, indeed, cheaper rent and cheaper housing. The cost of public transport is up 13 per cent. The cost of electricity has seen an 18 per cent increase since the coalition lost office. The cost of gas is up 25 per cent—we know those opposite don't like gas anyway—and the cost of insurance is up 26 per cent. That is hurting each and every individual, each and every small business, right across the nation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And what do we get in the budget? We get a public servant led recovery—36,000 more public servants. I'm not against public servants; they do a great job. I've been a minister in many portfolios and I've seen the great work they do. But when these decisions cost $24.4 billion over the four-year forward estimates to increase the amount of public servants, to increase the amount of bureaucracy, it hurts. It hurts taxpayers right across the nation. It hurts people who are already being told to pull their belts in, to make sure they rein in their expenses, yet they see in this great capital city of ours—and it is a great capital city—the beautiful roads and the increasing number of public servants, and they wonder why they are having to foot the bill. They're footing the bill because Labor is in power. They're footing the bill because Labor doesn't know how to govern properly for all Australians, and that is a terrific shame.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300126" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr REID</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:22</span>):  Addressing the cost of living is the federal Labor government's No. 1 priority. The 2024-25 federal budget demonstrates this. Our budget is about helping to ease the cost of living for every Australian no matter where they live, no matter who they are, no matter how much they earn. We understand that many Australians are under pressure up and down the income scale, and that is why the most recent budget is delivering cost-of-living measures that will make a real difference to every Australian.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A signature component of our budget is Labor's tax cuts. Every Australian taxpayer will receive a tax cut from 1 July, including the 66,000 taxpayers in the electorate of Robertson. On average this represents $1,580 per year, which will significantly help Australians on the Central Coast with the cost of living. In addition the Treasurer also announced energy bill rebates for every household and eligible small businesses. The government understands energy costs can be considerable on households and small businesses. That is why, come 1 July, every household will receive a $300 energy rebate and eligible small businesses will receive a $325 energy rebate. On the Central Coast this relief will assist the 12,810 small businesses within the electorate of Robertson. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy and play a tremendous role in employing hundreds of thousands of Australians across the country, and the Central Coast is no exception to this. We have a thriving small-business community, and I am pleased that our government is helping eligible small businesses with their overheads.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For several months, constituents in my electorate have been corresponding with my office about the unfair rate of indexation in relation to HECS debts. In 2023 the rate of indexation rose with inflation and saw HECS debts increase markedly. This issue continues to be a considerable concern in my community. I welcome the news that our government will change the way indexation is applied to HECS debts and will backdate this change to 1 June 2023, wiping $3 billion in HECS debts for hundreds of thousands of Australians across the country. This measure will make HECS fairer and ensure the large indexation increases that were recorded last year do not occur again. Across my community, that's just over 15,000 people who will see their HECS debts slashed, and there is a similar number in Dobell. So, in the Central Coast region, we're talking upwards of 30,000 people who will benefit from Labor's HECS changes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the topic of education, and speaking as a health professional, I'm very excited about the government's announcement in the budget that will create the Commonwealth prac payment for teaching, nursing, midwifery and social work students. This essentially means that students undertaking a degree in nursing, for example, will be paid to complete their mandatory prac placements, helping with living costs during quite a challenging period of their studies. This support will help assist more students complete their degrees, which will ensure that there are more workers in critical care sectors like health care, education and the care economy—sectors that are experiencing skills shortages and require more workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A component of the budget that has not received as much reporting recently is our government's commitment to delivering a better future for our defence personnel, our veterans, and their families. After a decade of neglect by those in the Liberal and National parties, it has taken a Labor government to address the inadequate funding of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I'm pleased that we will invest an additional $477 million to increase our support to the more than 340,000 veterans and dependants accessing services through DVA across Australia. Following our successful employment of an additional 500 frontline staff at DVA to eliminate veterans' compensation backlogs, we will employ an extra 141 staff to ensure backlogs like those that accumulated under the coalition do not re-emerge and to make claims processes faster. This is historic. It's an investment that increases funding for veterans' services to its highest level in over three decades. This support will also directly assist the 3,480 veterans and their families living in my electorate of Robertson.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are a government that is working every day to help every Australian reach their full potential, and we are a government that is delivering a better future.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILLCOX</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:27</span>):  I rise today to speak about the disastrous Albanese Labor government's budget. This is bad for Australians, it's bad for rural and regional Australians and it's particularly bad for my people in my electorate of Dawson. Just before the budget came out, there was an announcement that it was going to be a budget for the Bruce. For those who don't know, the Bruce Highway basically connects Brisbane to Cairns and Queensland. It's how all the farmers up north get their produce down to market. It's how people get their supplies up from the city. And it's how families get around and keep themselves safe. It's also how the tourists and the grey nomads travel up and down the coast, particularly in the wintertime. Right in the middle of it is Dawson, my electorate. From Mackay up to Townsville, right in the middle section of the Bruce Highway, is where my people live.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been two reports put out recently. One of them had to be required under freedom of information, and it gives star ratings, which go up to a five-star rating. That particular section of the Bruce Highway in my electorate of Dawson only gets to a two. It needs a lot of work. There is another report which shows it's one of the most dangerous sections of all of the Bruce Highway. So where would you think the money would go? Where would you prioritise? How much did the electorate of Dawson get for my section of the Bruce Highway—for my people's section of the Bruce Highway? A doughnut: absolutely nothing! It's unbelievable!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's explore where the money did go. The money went to a bloated bureaucracy to increase the number of bureaucrats in Canberra—36,000 more bureaucrats in Canberra at a cost of over $24 billion over the forwards. I have a little bit for those opposite about how the real world works. Say that you want to fill a pothole. In my electorate of Dawson, there's no shortage of potholes that need filling on the Bruce Highway. You have the boss, the middle management, the foreman and then the labourer who actually fills the pothole. But, after a couple of days of the pothole not getting filled, what's Labor's answer? 'We need more bureaucracy; we need to add another layer to the four lines.' Then we have the boss, senior management, middle management, the foreman and then the labourer. What happens? Everything just goes round and round and round in circles, and nothing actually happens. It all gets chewed up in the internal bureaucracy.</span>

                  </a>  But what do they do? What would the Nationals do? What do they do in private enterprise? This would be good for the member for Bruce to hear: they actually cut one of the layers out so that the boss tells the foreman to tell the labourer, 'Mate, you need to fill that pothole.' That's how you get things done. You don't get things done by sending internal emails going round and round and round in circles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Don't worry, I understand what you do—I understand what those opposite do. They flatten everyone's tyres—they flatten every Australian's tyres, and then they say, 'We'll give you a little bit of air for it, and you'll be grateful.' That's exactly what they've done with electricity prices. Say that your tyre is 35 PSI. Let the tyres down one day and then turn up the next day with a little compression and say: 'Oh, five or 10 PSI. That'll be enough to get them by.' That's exactly what they've done with electricity prices. For most of the people in my area, electricity has gone up by over $1,000 a year—$1,000 a year!—and what have they done? Given them $300 and expected them to be grateful. How fantastic is that? It's absolutely amazing!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McEwen</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:33</span>):  Thank you very much, Deputy Speaker Andrews, and it's great to see you in the chair! I rise proudly to speak on this motion because this is a responsible, restrained budget which eases cost-of-living pressures and invests in a future made in Australia. This is a budget that the opposition failed to deliver in their nine years of government. After all the bluster, billowing and flat tyres from over there, after nine years in government, they couldn't fill a pothole, but they could fill it with the press releases of the things that they said they were going to do but never actually did.</span>

                  </a>  Have a drink out of your 'back in black' mug! Remember that: 'back in black'? This was their budget, with the 'back in black' mugs and the slick videos with Scotty and Josh parading smugly down the corridors. But what did they deliver? The highest-ever deficits, highest-ever debt and nothing to pay for it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that's actually delivering back-to-back surpluses. Remember the famous claim of the former Liberal government: 'We will deliver a budget surplus in our first year and each and every year.'</span>

                  </a>  None from nine! Fair dinkum, they left the statisticians having a cup of tea, because they didn't deliver a thing except for debt and deficit. And they still try to claim that they're the great economic managers. This budget will provide essential cost-of-living relief: more homes for Australians, reforms to universities, a strengthened Medicare and the care economy, and broader opportunities for our society. That's how we're delivering cost-of-living relief. Our government has a plan. We're enacting positive policies that help every Australian. What do those opposite have? Nothing except rubbish about nuclear reactors and cutting the Public Service. When they talk about the Public Service they should think about our veterans. They love to wrap their flags around themselves and say they love veterans, but they want to slash support for veterans, keeping them in pain longer while they wait to have their claims heard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The only word that consistently comes from those opposite is 'no'. They've already said no to cheaper medicines, no to energy bill relief and no to cost-of-living tax cuts. They like to talk about Australians doing it tough, but they're shedding crocodile tears. How can they sit there and do that when they present no viable alternatives? Senator Hume let the cat out of the bag: 'We're the Liberal Party; we don't have policies.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The continued disingenuity of the coalition is ridiculous. They've backflipped on things like the new vehicle efficiency standard, to try to make political points. Let's remember the energy price hikes when they were in power. They went to the election with the good old member for Hume, Angus Taylor, signing off on a 20 per cent increase in power prices but changing the law so that no-one knew about it till after the election. That was their great policy. Of their 23 energy policies, they delivered none. They have the audacity to complain about energy prices when they in fact deliberately—willingly and knowingly—hid these price rises from the Australian public. As Angus Taylor would say to himself: 'Fantastic! Good job! Well done, Angus!' But the Australian people are suffering because of that terrible, deliberately deceitful action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Their continued negativity is no substitute for economic and policy credibility. We're getting on with the job of rolling out billions of dollars in cost-of-living relief that will take the edge off some of the pressures. The member for Petrie sits in here each and every day and cries because he's not getting a $10,000 tax cut. He's upset because he's getting a tax cut on his $250,000, but he doesn't want anyone who's on under $60,000 getting a tax cut. That's the mindset those over there have. You've got to wonder what goes through their heads when they sit down and think about these policies. No wonder the good ones are leaving! From 1 July, 76,000 taxpayers in the electorate of McEwen, every single one of them, will receive a tax cut: $1,583, on average, a year. There will be cost-of-living relief for 13.6 million Australians. Under the coalition, only the top end would have received a tax cut this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are providing energy relief, and we're doing that directly to make sure that we do not put pressure on inflation. This is relief that those opposite previously voted against—the electricity prices, as I said. We understand family budgets are tight and the impacts are being felt around the kitchen table. That's why we're doing the things we're doing. There will be $6.5 billion going to veterans over the next five years. The government is fixing up claims processing through increased staffing levels, resulting in our veterans having their claims heard and paid out a lot quicker. You would have thought the member for Riverina, who has in his electorate Kapooka, our biggest Army base, would have supported that, but he comes in here and says that, no, he doesn't support it. It's absolutely amazing! The legacy of the Morrison government is so many people left behind. We won't do that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We recently saw in the budget a grand plan for Australia's future: $22.7 billion for us to transition to a net zero economy over the next decade so that we can be globally competitive in the renewables industry. This is the Future Made in Australia plan. It sounds very futuristic to think about and a positive goal to strive towards, but what about the present? How are people coping with the cost of living as the government goes full throttle towards a net zero economy?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken many times in this House about the current cost for the many working families in my electorate of Fowler—and, no doubt, across Western Sydney—of filling up a petrol car. I was hoping to see some form of relief in the budget—a cut to the fuel excise, which would benefit every working Australian—but there was nothing. Long gone is the dream of filling up your car's tank without the stress of the price per litre. These days it seems like a game: looking for the service station with the cheapest petrol. Australians can expect about $100 or more for a full tank if the vehicle is larger. A tank worth $100 may not even be enough to take you throughout the week, and then you may have to refuel again. Sixty per cent of my Fowler constituents rely on their vehicles as their primary mode of transport. They commute to work, which may be outside the electorate. They commute to grocery shopping. They commute to doctor appointments. They commute to take their loved ones to and from places. What do you think it means for them? More money spent on petrol—money they may not have during this cost-of-living crisis. Can you imagine students driving to university, with no jobs but having to throw down $100 just to get to class? What about apprentices having to drive to their site for formal training on apprentice wages? Do you think they can afford it? To add fuel to fire, many of my constituents have to pay heavy tolls to travel from the west to where they work, mostly in the city.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Commissioner of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has shared that, while average petrol prices decreased in the December quarter of 2023, the retail petrol prices remain relatively high. Why hasn't the government done anything to force those energy companies to pass on cheaper fuel prices to our working people? Australian fuel prices are not controlled by the government and are dependent on the market—I get that. However, what about the GST and fuel excise that are levied by the Australian government? This is something within the control of the government of the day. Fuel excise is a flat sales tax levied by the government on petrol bought at the bowser and indexed twice a year in line with CPI. This is on top of the 10 per cent GST payable. As of 5 February 2024, the fuel excise levy has increased from 48.8c per litre to 49.6c per litre for every litre of petrol purchased. It may not be a small increase in the eyes of the government, but Australians can feel the pressure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are already living on the edge with the cost of living. Cutting fuel excise can give the relief that Aussies need during this time. The fuel excise was initially intended to be used to build roads infrastructure, but we now know that the money collected goes to general revenue. In times of economic crisis, why can't the government give Australians a little helping hand through cutting fuel excise? In 2022, the coalition government temporarily reduced fuel excise from 30 March 2022 to 28 September 2022, which provided significant relief to Australians following the aftermath of COVID-19. Many of my constituents were grateful for this policy and were disheartened when it ended.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Financial Review</span> in October 2023, it was reported that the government was not prepared to provide a cut to the fuel excise. Instead, I understand the government is pushing for cars that are more fuel efficient, equipped with low-emissions and net zero technology—all well and good, but not everyone can afford an electric car. Electric cars are still novel to Australians and could cost them their entire salary. I get that there are cheaper electric cars from China, but Fowler constituents are still spending their money thinly across expenses to meet the cost of living. The Australian government cannot expect us all to jump on the EV wagon in this current economy. I know that my constituents won't be able to afford it. It is unavoidable that my constituents and many Australians must use their vehicles to get to and from their destinations. I thereby call on the government to consider indefinitely cutting the fuel excise to assist working Australians who need to make a living and can use the extra money where it actually matters—for their households, families and loved ones. Australians need this relief now, and this is a most modest ask of the government.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McEwen</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:44</span>):  Today I happily rise to speak on this motion on the cost of living. The Albanese Labor government has delivered a restrained and responsible budget that will ease the cost-of-living pressures and not add to inflation. On 1 July this year, the Albanese government will deliver a tax cut to every Australian taxpayer, 13.6 million people. That includes the 76,000 people living in McEwen who will receive a tax cut. The average tax cut will be $1,583. In McEwen, that means 86 per cent of our taxpayers will be better off under Labor's tax cut. Additionally, every household will get $300 off their energy bill, which will help the household budget, but also over a million small businesses will be given cost-of-living relief through energy rebates. With this and the creation of better jobs and fairer wages across the country, the Albanese Labor government is standing up for Australians.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've been talking about the fuel excise. The member for Fowler brought up the price of fuel. While I believe it's a bit rich for inner-city quasi-Liberals to be raising this, I know it's an issue that affects my community, because we still have one of the highest rates of cars per household in the nation. Let's address the issues. Along with many others, Compare the Market's Chris Ford has attributed the rising fuel costs to the high price of crude oil. This is attributed to the conflict in the Middle East, higher wholesale prices from retailers and a weaker Australian dollar. But it's not predicted to stay that way for too long according to him. The member for Fowler argues that lowering the fuel excise, as the coalition temporarily did right before the election in 2022, is a solution. But, if you talk to the experts, like the head of the Australian Automobile Association, Michael Bradley, they warn against it. He said: 'As much as everyone doesn't like higher fuel prices and nobody likes paying tax, the fuel excise is a thing that enables governments to invest in the infrastructure we need. A short-term cut of a couple of cents would cause long-term pain. If we want the safe network that we need, if we want the efficient network we need, somebody has to pay for it. At the moment, it's the fuel excise that does that.' Money from the fuel excise goes directly towards fixing the state of our roads, something we in my community know the importance of all too well after nine years of funding starvation by the Liberal government, which took Victoria's road funding down to seven per cent of the nation's. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Getting from A to B, from work to the people you love, is important to this government. That's why in the budget we've committed $437 million of Commonwealth funding to the suburban road upgrades of south-eastern roads and northern roads. That includes funding a fair share of Yan Yean Road stage 2. The fuel excise cut only contributed to the appalling state of our roads because there was no money coming in to then go out to fix roads which were impacted heavily by things such as the wet winter we had. But the coalition thought they could fix roads with social media posts and unfunded promises. The fact is that you need to be able to fund roads with real money. You can't fill potholes with press releases.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are committed to road safety. We are pragmatic. We care about getting Australians home safely to their loved ones. That's why we introduced the government's new vehicle efficiency standards. These will support a greater choice of fuel-efficient vehicles and lead to decreased fuel excise receipts of $470 million over the four years from 2024-25. There are many vehicles that are already meeting the standards. There are many vehicles today. You hear those opposite say, 'You can't get them.' That's absolute rubbish. If your vehicle runs AdBlue you're a six. With the choice of electric vehicles, hydrogen vehicles and hybrids we're giving a greater selection. But, more importantly, we're looking at more fuel-efficient vehicles. You can still have your weekend. You can still have your ute. You can still do your trade. Not everyone needs to have a little 1.1-litre car. But where you can and it's efficient and good for you to use, do it. Why not have a more fuel-efficient car? Instead of having those opposite sit there and play at culture wars amongst Australians, even though it was a policy that they were going to bring in, but, as with most, squibbed it at the last minute, why not actually look to how we can build a better nation? You do that by not following the lead of Russia, which is what they over there want to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We even had the Leader of the Opposition come to my electorate and raise the fear about using utes on the weekend. That's probably the reason why my primary vote went up. But I want to remind him and those opposite: it isn't about getting rid of the family ute. That is just absolute garbage. It's about stepping up and being in line with the rest of the world and having the opportunities they have. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:49</span>):  I rise to very strongly support the member for Fowler on this motion. It's just a simple measure that puts $2,000 a year in the pockets of hardworking Australians. It's a very, very simple proposition. There's nothing sophisticated about it, and I wish we could see more of that in this place. Morris Iemma, the former Premier of New South Wales, said, 'I will not go another day without addressing the issue of people dying that simply don't have to die.' With that, he introduced 6½ per cent ethanol content to rescue people's lives, and that is why every country on earth has done it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two countries on earth that haven't done it—the only two that I know of—are Australia and New Zealand. Did you know that they are the only countries that have a foreign monarch on their coins? In our case, it's a very unpleasant foreign monarch. Do we believe that all people are free and equal? Absolutely not.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me return to the price of petrol. The honourable member for Fowler is doing something about it. Morris Iemma, if he got his way, would move towards Brazil, where 49.2 per cent of the petrol is ethanol and they fill up for $1.09 a litre. That measure, plus the member for Fowler's measure, would put $3,500 in the pocket of every hardworking Australian.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are talking about EVs. The Queensland government said they are very proud to say they are spending $62,000 million dollars on their new generation of electricity supply. Multiply that by the other states in Australia and you can see that you're not saving any money on electricity. Our electricity charges in Queensland were $700 when the government fell. On that basis, they should be around about $900 now, and, of course, they are around $4,000. That's what you've imposed—an extra $3,000 upon the electricity users—and you've got an opportunity to take $3,000 off, which is being precipitated today by the member for Fowler.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Don't you people sit down and think? We on the crossbenches have raised the issue of Woolworths and Coles and their 200 per cent mark-up on food. Electricity has got a 400 per cent mark-up, put on it by you people on both sides—not one side; both sides—of this house. Our motorcars are imported from overseas. The dollar dropped by half, so the price of a motorcar doubled in Australia. On housing prices, you set the regulatory impositions. Have you done anything to remove the regulatory impositions on subdivisions? No.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The word 'affordability' floats around this place like bulldust in a Bedourie dust storm I can tell you, but I see no practical benefits coming from all of this discussion on affordability, except that from the initiative of the member for Fowler. We applaud that initiative and we repeat that this country is sending $48,000 million a year overseas to buy petrol. We are sending $30,000 million overseas every year to buy motorcars.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When this country was run by decent people who cared and thought—and I still own a picture of Jack McEwan—he said that the most important thing for government was to get it right. Education is no replacement for hard work in getting it right. If there was the remotest effort or hard work here, you would address the issue of Woolworths and Coles, you would address the issue of electricity, you would address the issue of importing motorcars and you would address the issue of house prices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have announced that they're going to import EVs—not hybrids, which is what we need. No, they're going to import EVs—import! They're lowering the taxation on imported motor vehicles from China. What are we in the business of promoting? We're going to get our electricity from China. We're getting our motor vehicles from China. We're now going to replace our petrol and energy— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:54</span>):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion put by the member for Fowler. I completely understand the financial pressures that households and people are under right now. I also understand the focus on petrol prices as a focus of financial pain. Fluctuating prices at the pump are a constant source of pain for motorists. I know that many people rely on their cars to get to work and that there are parts of our community that did the heavy lifting during the pandemic and need to drive significant kilometres to be able to provide important resources and essential services. People are driving their cars to get to work, to get the kids to school and to do the shopping, and often for many people there is no other choice and it's an essential tool. So I recognise that, when petrol prices rise, it affects household budgets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last census, there was an average of 1.8 vehicles per household in Swan. I'm not one of those in Swan; since I've become a member of parliament, we've remained a one-car family. They say that one-third of vehicle trips is within two kilometres, and I see that people sometimes are trying to substitute their motor vehicle trips with alternative things, which might be walking, cycling or Ubers. There are different modes of transport that people can explore, but I recognise that this is something that's not possible for everyone. One of the things I was really grateful to do before the pandemic hit was buy a second-hand hybrid vehicle. That meant we got to travel more kilometres for less fuel. One of the things I'm very excited about is our vehicle efficiency standards, which are effectively about households being able to access cars where you can travel more kilometres for the same amount of fuel, which is very exciting. I also have a mate who has a horse. He's bought an electric vehicle that you can tow a trailer with. So there are alternative ways in which we can look at reducing fuel consumption for people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that households are doing it tough and that people are being stung at the pump, and a lot of this relates to the war in Ukraine, but we're trying to mitigate the things that we do have control over. I also remind the member for Fowler that the Liberals ended the fuel excise reduction in 2022. In my mind, Labor has found a better way to deliver relief to households and is delivering measures that will give ease to every household. It's something that I've raised here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also something that I'm acting upon in my community. As it happens, I'll be hosting my second forum in Swan this week to help people with household budgets. This will be happening along with state minister and local member Hannah Beazley. The forum will have speakers that will provide advice on tax, Centrelink and financial planning. It's a one-stop shop for people to receive advice on what services are available to help them meet the cost-of-living pressures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, across the board, this government is taking action to help people with easing the cost of living. It is our No. 1 priority: tax cuts for every taxpayer, 94,000 of them in my electorate of Swan; energy relief for every household, including 84,000 households in Swan; and wiping student debt, including for 22,000 students in Swan. We're also freezing the cost of PBS prescriptions for everyone. This is immediate, tangible and responsible cost-of-living relief for all Australians. Labor has found a better way to help households rather than looking at changing the fuel excise, and that's why I reject the motion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're not stuck in the past and looking at things that don't work; we're focused on the present and on solutions that will build a better future for Australia. I'm super excited about the new fuel efficiency standards, implemented by this government, which will provide greater choice for households. Australia and Russia were the only countries that didn't have standards on fuel emissions for vehicles. This is very exciting. In time, this will result in a reduction in fuel receipts of $470 million over the next four years. It's an innovative, responsible measure and it will help ease the cost of living, including for the people of Fowler. I encourage the member for Fowler to welcome those measures. I reject this motion.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:00</span>):  I rise to continue my remarks on the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024 and the Net Zero Economy Authority (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Net Zero Economy Authority is committed to finding ways to provide these workers with the training and skills necessary to thrive in emerging sectors, thereby securing their livelihoods and contributing to the overall economic resilience of our nation. I have spoken to many of these workers, both at home in the electorate and here at my parliamentary office. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many workers across these traditional emission-intensive industries who take great pride in their work, as well they should. Communities over many generations have been built around the mines, processing plants and factories that have kept our lights on, kept our houses warm and driven Australia's economy to the level of prosperity we enjoy today. We owe a great debt of gratitude to these workers, and they deserve nothing less than a government that respects their right to continue in meaningful work, to maintain their dignity and to share in the pride of participating in a project that is bigger than oneself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lessons on managing the green energy transition can be drawn from around the world, where various countries have developed effective strategies to balance environmental goals with economic and social needs. A notable example is in Germany, where the concept of the Energiewende—Germany's transition to renewable energy—emerged 20 years ago. The German experience underscores the importance of adaptability and foresight. The nation's peak union body now advocates for a just transition which encompasses education and training, reskilling initiatives and support for early retirement where necessary. This approach is deeply rooted in co-governance, reflecting the principle of 'nothing about us without us'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This philosophy has influenced other nations. In the United States, the Department of Labor promotes a just transition by ensuring the creation of quality green jobs while upholding workers' rights. This comprehensive strategy in the US includes involving workers in decision-making, providing essential training and new skill sets, offering social protection and investing in affected communities. President Biden further solidified this commitment by establishing the US government Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities and Economic Revitalization. Canada has followed suit, introducing the Sustainable Jobs Bill to prepare workers for a transition to a lower-carbon economy. The European Union has the Just Transition Mechanism. Similarly, Iceland has made a green and just labour market transition a priority during its presidency of the Nordic Council of Ministers in 2023. New Zealand has also taken proactive steps by establishing the Just Transitions Unit to coordinate and support the country's shift towards a low-emissions economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These international examples illustrate the critical importance of a just transition—one that not only aims for environmental sustainability but also ensures that the workers and their communities are supported and empowered throughout the process. Concrete examples already exist, locally. The Just Transition framework has informed the Western Australian Labor government's approach to renewal in Collie, inland from Bunbury, in the south-west corner of WA. The retirement of the Collie coal-fired power station is occurring in a phased, managed approach over the years to 2029. Last year, the state's Labor government announced a transition package for the town worth over half a billion dollars to both attract the industries of the future and decommission the existing industry, both of which will mean ongoing employment and local skills training. Things are already happening in Collie, with the confidence that government leadership and resolve can engender. In recent months, Green Steel of WA has sought development approval to construct a $400 million green steel recycling mill in Collie and is looking to commence operations in 2026. It aims to produce 450,000 tonnes of green steel each year, and is expected to generate up to 500 jobs during the construction phase and create 200 highly skilled, long-term positions for local workers most impacted by the energy transition. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, Neoen is constructing the Collie Battery, a four-hour duration battery which will be able to charge and discharge 20 per cent of the average demand of the South West connected grid. Once complete, it will be Australia's biggest battery. There is already a nearby solar farm, and more will be encouraged by these developments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the defining features of the Net Zero Economy Authority is its commitment to collaboration. The authority will work closely with federal agencies, state and territory governments, local governments, existing regional bodies, unions, industry stakeholders, investors and First Nations groups, among many others. This inclusive and collaborative approach is designed to ensure that the transition to a net zero economy is comprehensive, equitable and leaves no-one behind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Engaging with federal agencies will enable the authority to leverage existing resources and expertise, ensuring that efforts are not duplicated and that our policies are all aligned. By working with the state and territory governments, the authority can tailor its strategies to the specific needs and strengths of different regions, ensuring that local conditions and priorities are taken into account, while at the same time sharing the authority's experiences of those measures that have been helpful in other regions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Local governments and regional bodies are crucial partners in this project, as they are the front line of implementing policies and engaging with communities. Unions and industry groups will provide invaluable insights into the needs and the concerns of workers and businesses, ensuring that the transition is just and fair. Furthermore, involving First Nations groups is essential to incorporate traditional knowledge and ensure that the rights and interests of Indigenous communities are respected and promoted throughout the transition process. This collaborative approach will help build broad based support for the net zero agenda and ensure that the benefits of the transition are widely shared.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Net Zero Economy Authority will be able to support the development of renewable project industrial precincts. These precincts involve clustering industrial businesses in one location and powering them with 100 per cent renewable energy. In addition to supporting workers, the Net Zero Economy Authority will play a crucial role in coordinating programs and policies across different levels of government to help the regions and communities attract and take advantage of the new clean energy industries. This coordination is vital to ensure that the benefits of the transition are widely shared, fostering economic growth and development in all parts of the country. Moreover, the authority will assist investors and companies in identifying and embracing the opportunities within the net zero transformation. By doing so, it aims to stimulate innovation, drive investment and accelerate the adoption of sustainable practices across all sectors of the economy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To close, I echo the words of the Prime Minister on these bills: our government is absolutely determined to make this moment count, to make our future here in Australia, and this legislation is an important part of that.</span>

The legislation will coordinate the destruction of our energy system, coordinate policy and planning across government, and facilitate both government and private participation in investment—which is usually code for 'price signals', commonly known as subsidies—and support for affected workers. It will support First Nations Australians to participate in the transition—I'm just not too sure how solar panels and wind farms will do that—and deliver educational and promotional initiatives as Australia transitions to a net zero economy.</span>

A lot of very smart people and economic modellers—including people from the University of Melbourne, Princeton University, the University of Queensland, the Nous Group and many other eminent scientists and environmental economists—published, two years ago, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Net </span><span style="font-style:italic;">z</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ero Australia</span> study. They added up the cost of what will be required for us to transition, orchestrated by this authority. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are going to overbuild renewables many times. Our current 25-gigawatt system will be replaced with 400 to 500 gigawatts of solar and wind generation, up to 23,000 kilometres of extra poles and wires, 58 million solar panels and 35,000 wind turbines, with the consumption of many millions of acres of either grazing pasture country or pristine bushlands on hilltops, as well as an explosion of pumped hydro schemes in Queensland and New South Wales. It is going cheap—only $7 trillion to $9 trillion! That is not a transition; that is absolute lunacy! We don't mind that renewables have their place in the system, but to try and build a whole system based on weather-dependent, randomly variable generators is absolute madness. We have already closed 7,300 megawatts of 24/7 reliable power with the closure of many power stations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This series of bills does not deliver a just transition. It's going to affect all of us. It's not just going to affect people in a coalmine or working at a power station, but they are the first cab off the rank. We are all in this together because the whole economy of the nation depends on electricity. We are destroying our cheap electricity system. It is already multiple times more expensive than it was when we had predominantly baseload with a sprinkling of renewables. In flipping it on its head, we are losing the affordability and the reliability; affordability and cheap electricity have gone out the window. We're also inadvertently threatening our food security for seafood, with wind turbines and wind farms plonked smack in the middle of many prominent fishing grounds off the New South Wales coast, off the Illawarra and off Port Stephens. Because we are misallocating capital on a gigantic scale and we have electricity that is very expensive, we are driving inflation. The blood and the circulation of any industrial economy depends on your electricity system. We have already lost over half a million manufacturing jobs in this country, and we're not even halfway—a quarter of the way—to the so-called net zero transition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A lot of people haven't connected the dots, and it's up to us in this House to explain to people what this means. It will be a cataclysmic loss of our energy security. We already have many systems in place that these new bodies will add to or be confused with. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency are already doing many of the things this authority, which will be given another fresh lot of appropriations, will do as well. It is very much a duplicated, unnecessary authority, but the problem with it is the whole premise of what it's meant to be doing; that is the crazy thing. As I said, most people are very happy to have solar panels on their roof and do their bit for the environment, but when you base the whole grid on weather-dependent night-and-day-happening energy systems as well as batteries, as well as pumped hydro schemes, as well as millions of acres of pristine bushland and good farming grazing country and cropping country being covered with solar panels and wind farms—and the vast majority are not made in this country; they are imported from China and some from Europe, but the market for all these renewable generators is being swamped by cheap renewables coming out of China.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing is that there is no mention anywhere of funding the cheapest, the cleanest and the most green energy system that the world has got and that the rest of the world is transitioning to at a rate of knots—that is, nuclear energy. Nuclear energy has the smallest carbon footprint of any scalable energy generation system. If you're mining uranium for a nuclear power plant, without open-cut mining, it actually has a lower carbon footprint than solar and wind. It has energy density thousands of times higher than a solar panel or a wind turbine, and it works around the clock. The leftover spent fuel is a valuable resource that can be recycled, as opposed to burying acres and square miles of used wind turbine blades. Wind turbine generators have a five- or six-year life before they need major refurbishment and those last much longer than their stated life for when they're operating at sea. We only have to see the problems that Germany, Europe, England, the UK, Texas and California have—all those countries that have been on this transition have found out the hard way. Yet here we are, 10 years behind them and mimicking exactly what they've done. They have found out and are backtracking, realising that they need to triple nuclear energy generation in Europe and in America.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's happening in Africa; there has just been a huge nuclear conference there, and Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa and many other countries are all planning massive nuclear expansion. Many Asian economies have realised that; Japan has brought back online 11 of its mothballed nuclear power stations. France is expanding and Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands—all these countries which have been involved in nuclear, and some of them who have paused in the last 10 or 12 years, are reactivating their plans because they know it's scalable and that it's cheap when you have a system based on baseload systems as the predominant source of electricity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that I'll mention is that one of the outlined jobs is to identify power station employees that are employed by a corporation, either private or corporate. This authority is going to get all their details and somehow, mysteriously, give them an equivalent job. But the best job for people working in a power station is to put them into a similar job in a nuclear power station. That's because a nuclear power station is almost exactly the same as a coal-fired power station. It's only the pressure vessel which is different, where, through the wonder of fission, the nuclear material hits and boils water. Nuclear power stations are basically big kettles, but instead of firing granular coal in to boil the water, they just have enriched uranium sitting there. It's enriched up to only four to five per cent, it gets to a critical mass, it starts to glow red hot and boils water. That's the wonder of fission; you don't have to do anything, you just have to get a critical amount of it in one spot. Then that boiling water and steam run in a separate circuit and there's a heat-transfer system. Then—hey, presto!—it's just like a gas-fired power station. It spins the turbines; that's what happens with the steam and boiling water out of nuclear fission.</span>

When the construction is finished there are very few intermittent jobs, and most of the jobs in the green economy that those opposite are saying Australia will deliver won't be delivered in our country. They'll be delivered over in China or in Asia, where they make all these turbines.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another thing that many people have had some misunderstandings about is the idea that you get radiation from a nuclear power station. I'd like to let you know that I've confidently stood over Australia's nuclear facility with only fresh water in front of me. I didn't have any lead on me anywhere and I got zero radiation. The good member for Warringah, a member of the teal association of parties, came too and didn't get irradiated, either. We have 1,200 people employed in scientific pursuit led by nuclear power, and that's ANSTO. We have been early signatories to all the International Atomic Energy Agency committees and treaties for nonproliferation. We are a very nuclear-capable nation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In America, they have used economics to do their transition. In fact, America are seen as the big ogre dependent on oil and gas. Well, in a way, they have transformed their economy. They have transformed so many of their old, coal-fired power stations to power stations that are fired by coal-seam gas or natural gas, and they have reduced their footprint by 40 per cent in absolute terms; whereas we've had to use very dodgy accounting to see our reductions. They count all their national parks and all those other bits and pieces as we've done. We could transition, but to exclude nuclear from it is just an absolutely futile endeavour. What we will be doing is overbuilding renewables that have a very short lifespan. We'll be destroying agriculture. In America, they are planning to transition 66 coal plants to nuclear. Their department of energy has done a study and found that bringing a nuclear power plant into an economy delivers 650 permanent jobs, gives US$275 million dollars in extra economic outcomes in that area and reduces greenhouse gases by 86 per cent, and they have cheap electricity again.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Members on the other side: open your eyes; start reading. If we want to transition away from our coal-based energy generation, we need to include nuclear. There will still be a place for the renewables that are there, because all the rules and subsidies are shutting our coal plants down, but we can't base our whole economy on it. It is absolute madness. Having an authority with government money to enable it is— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MILLER-FROST</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:24</span>):  I rise to speak on the on the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024 and the Net Zero Economy Authority (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024. Two and a half years ago, when I was preselected for Boothby, we held a press conference outside Flinders Medical Centre. Among other things, I talked about what had motivated me to leave a very meaningful job delivering outcomes for those most in need across South Australia. It was a job that I loved and where I felt I was making a difference. One of the reasons I talked about was the complete lack of action by the former government on climate change. At that stage, we were seeing one-in-100-year floods happening seemingly monthly in the eastern states. We'd seen the Black Summer bushfires, and the firies and the scientists were telling us that fires had changed and that they were now fiercer and faster than in previous decades. We were seeing and we continue to see record-breaking heat, record-breaking cold and record-breaking storms. I was told a couple of months ago that the Mediterranean is now experiencing hurricane-like storms. Previously, due to the relatively small body of water that is the Mediterranean, there wasn't sufficient distance for low-pressure cells to gather that level of intensity. But now, with more energy in our atmosphere thanks to climate change, the storms are unlike anything that they've seen or that is on record.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Businesses knew that climate change was real. Ask any insurance company if they factor it into their risk assessment for policies. International capital was increasingly funding renewables and refusing to fund carbon based energy projects. Yet the previous Prime Minister, when he was Treasurer, brought a lump of coal into parliament and laughed at it. 'Don't be afraid,' he said. 'Don't be scared.' It probably depends on whether you're a short-term thinker or whether you really actually understand it in context. As a gesture, it very much demonstrated where the Liberal and the National parties were at, and I'm not sure much has changed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other frustration with the previous government and those opposite's steadfast refusal to engage meaningfully with climate change was the shortsightedness around the opportunities the energy transition brings. As a country with abundant natural resources—from the sun, wind and hydro to the abundant rare metals needed for the energy transition—the opportunities are calling out to us. We can transform our energy economy. We can become self-reliant for energy sources instead of being reliant on energy shipped in from overseas and having our backup reserves stored in another country and our own fossil fuel energy resources sold to Australian consumers at prices inflated by exposure to international markets. We can become the energy superpower powering other nations, but these opportunities won't seize themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The target is clear: achieve net zero emissions by 2050 to avoid the most dangerous impacts of climate change. The pathway is clear: power our industries, light our homes and our businesses and fuel our transport with clean energy, renewable energy and the cheapest form of energy. This government is determined that Australian workers and Australian ingenuity will get us there. We are not the doubters on the other side. As the race to net zero accelerates—and it is a race—we must ensure that Australian workers and communities are supported to play their part. There is a lot to be done; we should be much further along the track. We should have started a decade or more ago. And, of course, we did. But the unholy alliance of the Greens political party and the Liberal and National parties has instead positioned us clearly at the back of the pack. If the Greens and those opposite hadn't voted against the carbon pollution reduction scheme a decade and a half ago, Australia's carbon emissions would be 200 million tonnes lower, and electricity would be more affordable. This really poor decision by those opposite enabled a decade of inaction, not just on climate change but on energy policy generally.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A mere two years ago, under those opposite, aided and abetted by the Greens, we were in a very different place. There was no legislated target for net zero, and the concept was still very much up for debate. It frankly still is in some quarters. There was no legislated target for emissions reduction, because it wasn't really a target at all. There was no settled approach to the energy transition. They had 22 energy policies, and not one stuck. They had no plan to bring our electricity grid into the 21st century and no policy to ensure replacement capacity of the 24 coal plants that had announced, under them, closure dates. Remember that these closures are driven by rational decision-making by the companies that own those plants. They're driven by returns on investment predictions for shareholders, not ideology. But those opposite have their heads in the sand. One former Liberal premier went so far as to describe it as 'a slow-moving train wreck'. Senator Anne Ruston said on TV last week that she thought we were transitioning to renewables too fast. No, Senator, we're a decade too late. We are definitely late to the party after a wasted decade, and we need to catch up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government knows that it must play a critical role in positioning Australia not only to take advantage of the opportunities that the renewable energy transition offers but also to ensure that communities, particularly those where fossil fuels are a major part of their economy and jobs, are not left behind. They need also to participate and benefit from the transition. They need to know they have jobs in the future and jobs for their children. Those jobs may be different, but they will be secure, well-paid jobs that support them and their families. This is what the Net Zero Economy Authority is about. It's about establishing the government's role in ensuring that the transition works and that it works for Australians, for industry, for businesses, for workers and for families—for all Australians. It will better coordinate programs and policies to attract investors and help communities make the most of the transformation opportunities. It will engage major stakeholders in the decision-making and support structures. We will help deliver Australia's future as a renewable energy superpower.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But only by working together will we be able to grab the opportunities of the future. The government is establishing the new Net Zero Economy Authority because it wants Australia and its regions to prosper in the future. The shift to net zero is happening. Australia, along with the rest of the world, will be reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by the middle of the century, because we have to. As a fossil fuel based economy, the economic, employment and regional implications for Australia of the world decarbonising without us could be significant if not managed. Its job is to ensure that we are looking after Australia's workers and regions as we transform from a fossil fuel based economy to a renewable energy superpower. This recognises that the way we navigate economic change is as important as reaching the destination of a net zero economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The authority will be, on behalf of the government, a partner with industry and investors in getting big transformational projects happening—projects that decarbonise industrial facilities, build new industries and grow the future economic base for regions like Gladstone, the Hunter Valley, the Latrobe Valley, and the upper Spencer Gulf in South Australia. The authority will support workers through the change as Australia's ageing fleet of power stations retires. The authority will work with employers, unions and others to support workers into new opportunities. This is not just the right thing to do by workers; it also ensures that we're making good use of the highly skilled workers we're going to need more of in the net zero economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The authority will help communities navigate change, especially in those regions where change may be significant. This new authority, with its focus on managing the economic change, complements over $40 billion in government initiatives to reduce emissions and become a renewable energy superpower. This includes the $20 billion Rewiring the Nation program, which will modernise our electricity grid and infrastructure so it can support a renewable energy based energy system; the $1.9 billion Powering the Regions Fund, which will support the decarbonisation of existing industries and the creation of new clean energy industries; the $6 billion Critical Minerals Facility, which will grow our critical minerals production sector; the $2 billion Hydrogen Headstart program, which is supporting the development of large-scale renewable hydrogen projects; and the $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund, which will diversify and transform Australia's industry for a net zero economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Net Zero Economy Agency has undergone extensive consultations with groups all over Australia, both community groups and key organisations. We know that the task is to transition to a net zero economy. As we heard from those opposite, change can be scary, but change is inevitable. The Darwinian principle is 'adapt or die'. Change presents both opportunities and challenges.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what will the Net Zero Economy Authority actually do? The authority will have the following functions. It will promote coordination and consistency in the design and implementation of Australian government policies and programs and provide reports and advice to the minister. It will facilitate public- and private-sector participation and investment in greenhouse gas emissions reduction and net-zero transformation initiatives across Australia. The authority will work with established specialist investment vehicles and will not have its own funding to invest in projects. It will support workers in emissions-intensive industries who are affected by the net-zero transition to access new employment or acquire skills to improve their employment prospects. It will also implement the Energy Industry Jobs Plan. The authority will support Indigenous people and communities to participate in and benefit from the economic shift to net-zero emissions. It will support, develop and deliver educational and promotional initiatives for the purpose of promoting an understanding of Australia's transition to a net-zero-emissions economy and support social licence for the transition. Importantly, in performing its functions, the authority will be expected to prioritise communities, regions, industries and workers that are or will be significantly affected by Australia's transition to a net-zero-emissions economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Climate change poses an existential threat to our way of living. We've already started to see this, with more frequent floods, fiercer and faster bushfires, more intense and frequent storms, and the beginning of sea-level rise. Responding to climate change is not only necessary to mitigate the impacts at a local level; we, along with the rest of the world, need to transition to a net zero economy if we're going to have any hope of holding the temperature rises to 1.5 degrees and limiting the impact of climate change. We need to undertake this energy transition quickly, but we also need to do it in a managed way that brings all Australians along with us, ensures energy security and maximises our opportunities and our natural assets to become a renewable energy superpower. That is what the Net Zero Economy Authority is about.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PITT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:37</span>):  I rise to speak on the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024 and the Net Zero Economy Authority (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024. We've heard a lot from those opposite: emotional hubris with nothing based on facts, plenty of noise and plenty of media spin. And now we're hearing about how the Net Zero Economy Authority will save regional towns and regional jobs. I just want this debate to be based on some facts, and here's one: China's increase in emissions in one year—just the increase, not its contribution—was bigger than this country's entire contribution for 12 months. It went up by the amount that we contribute as a whole in a year. I want our response to be proportionate to our contribution. I think it's incredibly important to talk about the impact that the policy of those opposite will have on the people that I represent and the people that the members for Flynn, Lyne and others represent, because this government's policies will put them out of a job—out of the high-paid, highly skilled jobs in regional areas which drive their local economies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wrote a piece a few weeks ago, and I want to put some of it on <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>. It's about nuclear power. Nuclear works. It's reliable. It's technically feasible. Here are the things it doesn't need: it doesn't need 28,000 kilometres of transmission lines and it doesn't need to cover the country in a blanket of solar panels and windmills. It's zero emissions. Importantly for the regions most impacted by potential coal-fired power station closures, many skills employed in those coal-fired power stations transfer directly to nuclear power generation. Labor's green plan means job losses. The coalition's plan means job opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you compare coal fired power to nuclear generated power, you see that it is virtually the same equipment from the moment that steam enters the steam pipe right through until it is electricity in a transmission line supplying the electrical energy that powers the nation. It needs specialists in turbines, generation, distribution, planning and maintenance engineers, administration, safety, specialist welders and condition monitoring. Nuclear power plants need them all and then some. Yes, you will lose coal-handling systems, conveyors and ash plants—they're not required—but you will need fuel rods, fuel management, condensate, waste and operations of the steam plant. They are highly paid, highly skilled jobs from the same regions that provide highly paid and highly skilled jobs in existing coal-fired power stations. They are a direct transition. If you are a steam-turbine fitter in a coal-fired power station, you have the same job in a nuclear power station. </span>

She was one of the first two women to ever graduate in mechanical engineering from QUT—coincidently they were both called Karen. Karen Andrews said: 'Nuclear generated electricity for Australia just makes sense economically, for reliability and from a skills point of view.

Mr Massola said that he'd been talking to Prime Minister Albanese, who's rubbing his hands together about a scare campaign over nuclear in this country at the next election. A comment that Mr Massola made was, 'It's about the three-eyed fish from <span style="font-style:italic;">The Simpsons</span>.' Are you seriously proposing that we will have nuclear reactors in submarines—that will go to Brisbane, Adelaide, Sydney, Melbourne and Perth? There'll be no three-eyed fish there; that will only happen if we use nuclear to generate electricity. It is nonsensical that, apparently, you're going to run a scare campaign—not you, Madam Deputy Speaker Vamvakinou; the Labor Party—and offer free iodine tablets within 100 kilometres of any proposed site for a nuclear reactor. I've got news for the member for Grayndler: he'd better start handing them out now; in fact, he should have started five decades ago. There has been a nuclear reactor in Sydney for more than 50 years. And I'm pretty confident it's within 100 kilometres of the member for Grayndler's electorate. I look forward to the offer of free iodine tables for the entire population of Sydney. If this is the scare campaign that's being proposed, it is absolutely ludicrous.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can look at the proposals for green hydrogen—and the member for Flynn is sitting here next to me. I saw some commentary from a presentation in Gladstone about the green hydrogen proposal. You need to double the east coast's generation capacity. It's about 60 gigawatts now. You need 110 or 120 gigawatts of energy generated just for the green hydrogen proposal, just for Gladstone. You need 10,000 wind turbines. If I remember correctly, it's 2½ thousand square kilometres of solar panels. Madam Deputy Speaker Vamvakinou, can you picture what this looks like? The Labor Party's proposal is to get the dozers out and clear and level 2½ thousand square kilometres of this country and then cover them with China-made solar panels—and somehow that is a good outcome for the environment. I just can't join the dots. I just don't see how this marries up. In fact, Labor's own talking points have referred to the fact that their proposal for wind and solar in this country will require nine times more resources to build than the equivalent in gas generation. Where are the Greens? Are they happy about this? You need nine times more mining, nine times more trucks, nine times more approvals and nine times more processing. Why wouldn't you just build the gas one? That makes sense. It works—it works all the time.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have the uranium and the technology. This country is delivering a nuclear industry. It is supported by the Labor government because, without it, we are not delivering AUKUS. We've seen over $3 billion committed into the UK to build a reactor in the United Kingdom to train the people of the United Kingdom—the trainees and technical professionals of the United Kingdom—to build a reactor for Australia's submarines. I want to see that investment made and that technical capability built in this country. The proposal under the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill is that you're going to lose your job but it's okay for us to invest in another country. We can build that technical capacity somewhere else, even though it is this country's asset. The people in those regions—those highly skilled individuals that make these power stations run, and I've been in any number of them—are good people. They're in good jobs. They've spent their lifetimes training to make these things run at incredibly high standards of reliability. It is exactly the same job in a nuclear power station because there is no difference: it is steam sent into a turbine to turn a generator to deliver, for the Australian people, electricity that is affordable and reliable and has a tiny footprint.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are seeing thousands of hectares of koala habitat being damaged and destroyed by the installation of wind turbines and solar panels. That is absolutely true. I see the minister at the table, the member for Burt, complaining. You only have to look at the environmental plan for the Clarke Creek wind farm. It says that 3½ thousand hectares of koala habitat are impacted. You only have to look at the pictures. In Queensland, in fact, they have development legislation around vegetation management and reef regulation, but it doesn't apply to wind turbines and solar panels. It'll apply if you're trying to run cattle or grow sugar cane or produce avocados, but it doesn't apply to those other industries.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not happening by accident and it is not happening without significant taxpayer funding. I had some work done by the Parliamentary Library, and the numbers associated with the Renewable Energy Target alone are just ridiculous. If you assume a price of $40 per certificate, it is $26 billion that electricity consumers in this country have contributed towards this type of energy. It costs a fortune. It doesn't work. It will cover huge swathes of this country in manufactured panels from China which can be destroyed in a hailstorm, a cyclone or a bushfire. Guess what? In this country we have those challenges.</span>

I want us to be able to deliver affordable, reliable energy that makes all our businesses competitive, not just the ones that elected the Labor government, the ones they picked out for their 'Made in Australia / Made in America' fund. We want every business in this country to be competitive, and we want those people who have jobs right now to keep them. Labor's proposal is for those jobs to be lost; the coalition's proposal is for those opportunities to be maintained. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BOYCE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flynn</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:52</span>):  I rise to speak on the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024 and the Net Zero Economy Authority (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024. In the two years of this Labor government, we have seen attack after attack on the industries that have built and powered this nation. Let me be clear: this legislation is another attack on the hardworking men and women of this country, especially anyone who lives in Central Queensland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the legislation, the authority's functions would be to coordinate net zero policy and planning across government, facilitate both government and private participation and investment, support affected workers, support First Nations Australians to participate in the transition, and deliver educational and promotional initiatives as Australia transitions to a net zero emissions economy. There are two broad aspects to this legislation, which operationalises the authority's power. The first is to facilitate new investment in net zero transition. It's intended that the authority will be the shopfront for industry and investors. It will seek to work with project proponents and state governments to get renewables projects to investment decision. The authority will also mobilise public moneys through vehicles like the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the National Reconstruction Fund. With private financing support, it will address enabling infrastructure needs and navigate regulatory processes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second responsibility of the authority is to assist impacted workers in the transitioning areas through the Energy Industry Jobs Plan. The Energy Industry Jobs Plan would allow the authority to utilise the industrial relations system to manage the redeployment of workers in closing coal-fired and gas-fired power stations and their dependent employees—for example, in coalmines that are aligned to these closing power stations. The plan does not specify or anticipate the types of employment that workers may transition to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of jobs, the Labor government claims it will support the jobs transition of highly paid, highly skilled people who have become redundant in both the traditional power generation sector and the mining and resources sector. The government needs to explain how thousands of well-paid jobs will become available in the renewable energy sector. Furthermore, what support is offered to existing businesses and communities? For example, if the Callide Power Station in Biloela is to close in the future and some 250 jobs leave that economy, that means fewer children at the school. It means fewer groceries are sold at the store. It means less beer gets drunk at the pub. It means less rate base for the local government authority. The list goes on and on. Furthermore, research has found that workers who lose their jobs when a coal-fired power plant closes are earning only half their pre-redundancy income years after being laid off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It becomes clear that this government is all politics and no plan. The detrimental effects to the economy and the general cost of living, reliability of power generation and the cost to heavy industry and manufacturers have not been clearly understood. For example, does the committee really believe that the alumina industry in Gladstone can exist and be competitive on the world stage if they are to rely solely on power generation from wind, solar and batteries? What guarantees can the government offer that heavy industry will exist in the future with such energy policy?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor government passed the safeguard mechanism last year. Mr Bowen announced in Gladstone that 215 of Australia's largest emitters would be required to cut emissions by 4.9 per cent each year through to 2030 to help reach its emissions targets. Of the 215 industrial facilities, 28 operate in the Capricornia electorate, and 18 operate in the Flynn electorate in Central Queensland. That means 30 per cent of the top 215 companies set to be taxed are in Central Queensland, and we all know that Central Queensland is the economic engine room of Australia. The legislation will have a larger effect on our region than any other region in Australia. Labor's safeguard mechanism targets facilities that emit more than 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year. If facilities go over this amount, the businesses will need to buy carbon credits or carbon offsets. As these credits cost money, this is just a new cost impost on job-creating industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Facilities to be taxed in the Flynn electorate include the APLNG facility, Batchfire Resources, Blackwater mine, Boyne Smelters, Curragh mine, Curtis Island LNG plant, Dawson mine, Ensham mine, Fishermans Landing Cement Australia, Jellinbah mine, Kestrel mine, Oaky Creek mine, Queensland Alumina Ltd refinery, Queensland Curtis Island LNG plant, Rio Tinto Yarwun, Rolleston coal mine, Yarrabee coal mine and Yarwun nitrates. In 2021, Rio owned the Yarwun refinery in Gladstone, which purported to employ 700 people, a majority of whom were living in the local region. About 500 contractors were employed for the annual shutdowns and other activities. Yarwun refinery's annual production exceeds three million tonnes of alumina. Queensland Alumina Ltd in 2020 paid $983 million in contributions to the economy, including salaries, partnerships, in-kind support, taxes and total national supply spend. QAL sends alumina to locations such as Tasmania, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, China, New Zealand and Russia, as well as Queensland manufacturing businesses. However, it was announced last year that Rio Tinto has slashed US$1.2 billion from the value of its Australian alumina assets on the back of the federal government's safeguard mechanism, writing off the value of its Yarwun alumina refinery completely due to the need to buy carbon offsets as an asset. Rio Tinto also slashed US$227 million from the value of its share in Queensland Alumina Ltd. Since Labor's safeguard mechanism was announced, I've called it an attack on heavy industry and the thousands of workers that work in this sector, and it has proven to be exactly that. While Labor claims to be a friend of the working man and woman, it is happy to shut down these industries that employ them. You simply cannot trust the Labor Party with your job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many in this House would not be aware that, without the mining and resources sector, Australia would not be the prosperous nation that it is today. Queensland Resources Council presented a fact sheet for the Flynn electorate for the 2021-22 financial year. The total economic contribution for the mining and resources sector in Flynn was $17.7 billion of gross regional product, and the sector supports 50,942 local jobs. Central Highlands Development Corporation produced a fact sheet for the Central Highlands region, which has Australia's largest coal reserve and 12 operating coalmines. The region produces more than 62 million tonnes of coal, which represents 28 per cent of Queensland's total production. Mining is the largest employer in Central Queensland, with a direct workforce exceeding 6,000 people. Fifty-five per cent of those workers are nonresidents commuting by road or air from Rockhampton, Mackay and South East Queensland. Ninety per cent of non-resident workers stay in accommodation villages and 10 per cent in other accommodations such as motels, hotels and caravan parks. In the local Central Highlands economy, over $790 million is spent on local goods and services, which is estimated to be 30 per cent of the total spend. Astonishingly, the Central Highlands has an output of $9.4 billion. These export dollars are helping to pay for our schools, hospitals, roads, emergency services and so forth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Has the federal Labor government assessed what this proposed legislation means for these mining communities? What the government has failed to work out is how their policies and taxes on the industry are forcing up the cost of everything. Australians know that, despite the Treasury's spin, prices have increased by nearly 10 per cent, with increases for many essential items well beyond that. Housing is up 12 per cent, rents up 12 per cent, insurance up 26 per cent, electricity 18 per cent and gas up 25 per cent. And, of course, these prices are still going up when the government is putting taxes on critical industries and slapping cash on unreliable ones.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier in my speech, I spoke about how the Labor government is taxing 18 of the industries in the Flynn electorate—industries that make alumina and cement and get gas to market. No wonder we have seen these increases in the cost of everything, including housing and energy. To make matters worse, we see this government throwing money at a proposal of 58 million solar panels, almost 3,500 wind turbines and 28,000 kilometres of new transmission poles and wires. The level of duplication of the proposed Net Zero Economy Authority's responsibility to promote new investment in net zero transition and existing Commonwealth entities is beyond a joke. How many federal agencies tasked with renewable financing does the Commonwealth require?</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This approach focusing on facilitating investment consistent with net zero ambitions also leans into the government's preference for picking winners rather than genuine investment facilitation and job creation. A national body risks a top-down, Canberra-centric approach which does not fully consider the regional needs and priorities. It is also likely that, once established, the Labor government will continue to add additional powers and responsibilities to the authority to support its net zero and climate change ambitions. Will the government rule out giving this net zero authority new powers to streamline and/or expedite regulatory approvals or financing the transformational green energy projects? In the targeting of Labor's 2024-25 budget, the funding for the authority and its related activities is budgeted to be $399.1 million from 2023-24 to 2026-27 alone, with further funding totalling $1.1 billion over the medium term. This is on top of billions of dollars of additional funding being moved into the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the newly badged Future Made in Australia. Over $13 billion in taxpayer funded subsidies for big businesses doesn't address the source of Labor's cost-of-living crisis. Labor's focus should be on dealing with energy costs, high inflation and out-of-control red tape. Instead, Labor continuously fails to address these fundamental realities facing most Australian businesses.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With insolvencies at record highs and more businesses going offshore, supporting a small number of big businesses is irresponsible and a slap in the face for small business desperately seeking answers from this government on how to survive. The level of duplication between the Net Zero Economy Authority and the existing Commonwealth institutions demonstrates a complete waste of over $1 billion of federal government funds over the forward estimates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the bills will require employers to offer workers retraining opportunities in an attempt to match employees with new jobs in the green economy, they are unlikely to benefit older, experienced workers approaching retirement or workers with highly specific skill sets. There is concern about the scope of the legislation, particularly for smaller, independent employers. The explanatory memorandum provides an example of a local cleaning service with a commercial relationship with a closing generator being classified as an independent employer. It is not clear what liability or obligations a cleaning service would be expected to adopt under the energy industry jobs plan. It would be up to the FWC to determine this. There are no carve-outs or exclusions for small business in the legislation. These organisations are unlikely to have the resources or the capacity to administer the services outlined in the bills. It is also unclear whether this plan will apply only to permanent employees of closing generators or whether casual employees will also be captured.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition will oppose the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024 and the Net Zero Economy Authority (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024. This is due to bureaucratic waste and duplication, with a top-down, Canberra-centric approach that is set to fail on delivering the unique needs of the regions; the imposition of new obligations on small, medium and large businesses; and the fact that this is another example of Labor's haphazard approach on industry policy, which delivers no guarantees for local workers. I urge all members to vote these bills down.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHESTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gippsland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:06</span>):  I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate on the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024 and the related bill because this is a critical issue. It is a critical issue because there is obviously a direct correlation between our national security and our energy security. We need to get the settings right. We need to be rational and balanced. We need to get the right policy settings for the longer term in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, the bills before the House today reveal the heart and soul of the modern Labor Party. This was once a party with connections to blue-collar workers and hardworking Australian families. Now it's a party which is being driven by left-wing ideologues and a weird and quite absurd belief that Canberra knows best. I have a little warning for those opposite: you simply can't out-green the Greens. No matter how hard you try, they will never be satisfied. Just listen to the extremist language from the Greens over the last couple of years. The unhinged rhetoric, such as that the planet is boiling, is only adding to the climate anxiety which exists among many young people in Australia today. A balanced debate is needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A little reality check is important as well: there is no Australian solution to what is undoubtedly a global challenge. We need to be taking action from a position of national strength. In the rush to secure some sort of political advantage, we have seen extreme and outrageous claims often being made in this debate when all Australians want are facts. Australians want us to get on with the job of practical action and to provide reliable, affordable and sustainable energy at the least cost to the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To manage a problem, first of all, you have to measure it and understand your capacity as a nation to actually respond. I asked the federal Parliamentary Library to research Australia's percentage of contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions. It advised me that currently we are the world's 14th largest emitter, with 1.3 per cent of the total emissions. The remaining three coal-fired power stations in my electorate of Gippsland make up 7.8 per cent of that 1.3 per cent total, and they still provide more than 60 per cent of Victoria's energy needs. Those three power stations have underpinned the growth of Victoria and the ability of the national electricity market because of the reliability and affordability offered by coal-fired power. I have said many times that the Latrobe Valley can be very proud of its contribution to our nation, and the power station workers and their families should be respected as a transition to alternative energy sources occurs over the next 20 years. But there is no Gippsland solution. There is no Latrobe Valley solution. There is no Australian solution to this global challenge. That's why we need a balanced approach which is synchronised with international commitments. Decisions which undermine our energy security will impact on our national security, so it's critical we get the policy settings right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Flynn was right; the level of duplication of the proposed Net Zero Economy Authority's responsibility to promote new investment in the net zero transition and existing Commonwealth entities is beyond a joke and will not be supported by those on this side of the House. He quite rightly asked, 'How many federal agencies tasked with renewable financing does the Commonwealth actually require?' This approach—the Labor Party's approach, backed by the Greens, focused on facilitating investment consistent with net zero ambitions—also leans on this government's preference for trying to pick winners with its Canberra-knows-best mentality rather than genuine investment facilitation and jobs creation. It is a top-down approach which has been proven to fail on many occasions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You have to ask: when was the last time Canberra picked a winner that didn't involve regional Australia losing out? When Canberra starts picking winners based on political science, the regions always suffer. It's extremely disappointing to me that we now see in the Latrobe Valley the Japanese government and industry leaders demonstrating more support for the Latrobe Valley based hydrogen energy sector than our own Prime Minister. Despite the success of the Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain Pilot Project, which attracted seed funding in its initial stages from the former coalition government and the state Labor Party, today's Labor Party is openly hostile to any alternative uses for the brown coal in the Latrobe Valley. This is an incredible natural resource and we should be open minded to alternative uses in the future as technology develops, not allowing Canberra to dictate to the people of Latrobe Valley what their future jobs might look like. Producing hydrogen for transport needs can help reduce global emissions, and it's Japan taking the lead; it's Japan taking the HESC project to the next stage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of supporting this innovative approach, the Prime Minister has buckled to the demands from the Greens and turned his back on the hardworking families looking for energy and job security in the Latrobe Valley. In a deal with the Greens, the Albanese government has specifically ruled out coal, gas and native timber projects receiving any funding support under the $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund. This fund was meant to help diversify regional economies and is designed to attract private investment to make it easier to commercialise innovation and technology. But the modern Labor Party, driven by those left-wing ideologues, has ruled out projects which involve coal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also ruled out projects which involve investment in the native timber sector. Even the United Nations, the Australian Forest Products Association and many other organisations acknowledge that sustainable harvesting of hardwood timber is a way to sequester carbon; it's actually good for the planet because it's the ultimate renewable resource. Just last weekend I had the pleasure of being in St Kilda, and I checked out the $53 million St Kilda Pier redevelopment. It's a great project, a fabulous project. But imagine my disgust and dismay on finding out that the hardwood timber which is going to feature on the decking and be quite an iconic part of this magnificent part of the St Kilda foreshore is going to be Darwin stringybark sourced from Queensland. Timber is going to travel at least 2,000 kilometres to make it to Melbourne to be included in this project, yet just down the road, in Gippsland, the Allan government and the Andrews government banned the harvesting of all native hardwood timber—but they are still quite happy to take hardwood timber from other states. What we're doing in Victoria is not using less timber—we're still using hardwood timber—but taking it from other places. That's the problem with timber: you use either your own or someone else's, and 'someone else's' in this case is timber from Tasmania, New South Wales, Queensland and a whole host of countries with lower environmental protocols than our own state.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's the same—and this is the broader debate about net zero and caring for the environment—with the new vehicle efficiency standards, which are part of the government's plan to reduce emissions. Most of the costs will be borne by regional people. This government, this Prime Minister, came to power promising openness and transparency. Then we saw the tactic, in the last sitting period, of muzzling all debate in the House of Representatives on the vehicle efficiency standards legislation. This is the car and ute tax which all Australians will be forced to pay under this government. Instead of hearing the concerns and suggestions from the opposition, the government acted like some sort of tin-pot dictatorship and silenced all its critics in this chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians have a right to know what the impacts will be on them under this Labor-Greens plan to introduce a new tax on cars and utes. There have been estimates that, for some of Australia's most popular cars—the highest selling vehicles in this nation—their sticker price, when you drive them out of the yard, will increase by tens of thousands, certainly thousands, of dollars. In the middle of a cost-of-living crisis, that makes no sense whatsoever.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Who are the people that are buying these four-wheel drives, SUVs and people movers? Well, they're my people. They're the people in Gippsland with little choice than to buy those types of vehicles, because they don't have the luxury of taxpayer funded trams, buses and trains for their transport. They rely on their personal vehicles, and their vehicles are critical. The choices they make are critical, whether they are about their workplace, if they're tradespeople, or their source of recreation, if they want to tow a boat of a horse float. The way they stay connected to their families and friends is through these larger vehicles, and they are the ones who will be paying more under this vehicle efficiency standard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the minister and the Prime Minister refuse to release any modelling. They refuse to tell the truth to the Australian people about what the actual cost will be to the sticker price when you drive out the gate in those vehicles. Everyday Australians just want the minister to be honest. Just be honest and tell us how much more we will pay. In the middle of a cost-of-living crisis, how much more will I pay for my SUV, for my people mover, for my tools of trades as a tradesperson in regional Australia? By hiding the modelling, what are they actually hiding from Australian families?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Madam Deputy Speaker Vamvakinou, let me assure you that regional Australians hate this policy. They hate this policy. They understand that they're going to pay more for their family vehicles, and they don't want to do that in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis. They don't have the inner-city privilege of public transport. They rely entirely on their own private transport, and they know they're going to pay more for those vehicles in the future under this government. Families who are already struggling with a cost-of-living crisis don't want to see an additional tax on their favourite vehicles, but they do want the Prime Minister and the minister to be open and transparent with them. Tell them the truth. Tell them how much it's going to actually cost them when they drive those vehicles out the gate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The absolute worst part of this policy is the way it does actively discriminate against the people who are represented in this place. It's designed—it's a deliberate design measure—to target regional Australians and their way of life, and, quite fairly, they are furious about the position they're being placed in by this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe the vast majority of Australians accept the science around climate change. I also believe that those in my community and those throughout many other regional communities respect the natural environment. They are actually the ones who join Landcare and Coastcare and do the practical work, the practical action, to look after the environment of that area, and they believe our nation has to do its share of the heavy lifting. But when we continue to have those opposite and those on the crossbench making ridiculous claims and political points that nothing has been done on climate change for the past decade, it does create anxiety. It's unnecessary, and it's actually dividing our nation in a way which is not required, when we understand that the vast majority do want to see action on reducing our emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous government had a proud record, in terms of practical action to support the environment. The previous government supported investment in major renewable energy projects like Snowy 2.0 and put in place the Technology Investment Roadmap, with $22 billion for new energy technologies. It's also important to note that we as a nation have continued to meet and exceed our global emissions reductions target. Australians can be proud of that; Australians should be proud of that. We have reduced our emissions faster than comparable economies like Canada, Japan and New Zealand. It is simply ridiculous to suggest there was a decade of inaction when we continued to meet our international obligations. The previous government worked with states and communities to see Australia become a massive investor in household solar and large-scale renewables, and this was all done without economy- and job-destroying taxes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, it's the same with the current debate on nuclear energy. The government, the Greens and the teals would rather yell and scream and make outrageous claims to silence their critics than actually engage in a rational conversation with the Australian people. From my perspective, I have an open mind when it comes to this public debate regarding nuclear energy in Australia. I think it's time for a calm and rational conversation with the Australian people which is based on facts, on technology and on environmental science, not on hyperbole, on fear campaigns and on political science. My region of Gippsland has a proud heritage as an energy-producing region and a high level of what I'd call energy literacy in the community. People understand what is a complex energy trifecta of affordability, reliability and environmental sustainability. They want to be trusted with the information and the facts. They want to make their own decisions on what is the best way forward not only for our committee but also for our nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just as we are considering large-scale renewable projects with offshore wind farms, energy from waste in Maryvale, the coal-to-hydrogen project and the potential recycling of coal-fired power station biofuels, we need to take a pragmatic approach to this nuclear debate. If there's bipartisan support—which there is—for nuclear-powered submarines as part of the AUKUS agreement, we should be able to have a rational debate in this place and in the committee about the merits of nuclear technology to help meet our future energy needs in Australia. There are dozens of advanced countries throughout the world which utilise nuclear technology already, and Australia remains the third largest exporter of uranium to help power those economies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's premature to be ruling regions in or out as potential locations for a nuclear power station, because there is simply no proposal on the table right now. But, as a matter of principle, I would say this: you would need to be able to demonstrate to a potential host community—including Gippsland—that any safety concerns can be ameliorated and that there are direct social and economic benefits to that community. We are continuing to have this conversation in my community. We recognise that the Latrobe Valley has some strategic advantages owing to our existing transmission infrastructure and our skilled local workforce, but if we're going to host a large-scale energy infrastructure in the future—whether it's nuclear, renewables or biofuels—there has to be respect shown to local communities and direct economic benefits for the region. I urge those opposite to engage in a constructive, rational and sensible way on the energy debate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CALDWELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:21</span>):  I rise this afternoon to speak to Labor's superfluous bureaucratic proposal for a Net Zero Economy Authority. This Labor government's obsessions with big government and renewables have combined in what is potentially the most senseless proposal to take care of the unions, Canberra-centric public servants and their big corporate mates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation before the House—the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024 and a related bill—will transition the current Net Zero Economy Agency from an executive agency within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to a new standalone statutory authority. By examining the detail, we can see where the Albanese Labor government's priorities lie. The authority's intended functions are described as follows: coordinate net-zero policy across government, facilitate government and private participation, support affected workers, support First Nations Australians and deliver educational incentives around the transition. The first thing that popped into my mind was, 'I wonder whether there will actually be a net reduction in bureaucrats within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet or not.' We will see. It also flags, in the priorities, that the whole process of this race to net zero in world-record time is clearly going to require support for affected workers. It is inherent in the way in which Labor are approaching this that they will be causing harm. We know from experience with this underwhelming government what these bills will translate into in reality: a bureaucratic waste of an agency that will be overresourced and that will, ultimately, underdeliver. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two broad aspects of this legislation that operationalise the authority's powers. The first is facilitating the new investment in the net-zero transition. The authority intends to be a so-called shopfront for industry and investors. It will seek to work with projects' proponents and state governments to get renewable projects to investment decision. The authority will also mobilise public moneys through vehicles like the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the National Reconstruction Fund, with private financing support; address enabling infrastructure needs; and navigate regulatory processes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second responsibility of the authority is the aim of assisting the impacted workers in that transition area through the Energy Industry Jobs Plan. The Energy Industry Jobs Plan would allow the authority to utilise the industrial relations system to manage the redeployment of workers in closing coal-fired and gas-fired power stations and their dependent employers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The plan fails to specify or anticipate the types of employment that workers may transition into. These are essentially IR bills disguised as bills for the regions and the transition. The coalition will oppose these bills because, ultimately, they're bureaucratic waste and duplication. They have a top-down, Canberra-centric approach that is set to fail on delivering for the unique needs of regional Queensland and Australia, because of the imposition of new obligations on small, medium and large businesses and because of the fact that it is another example of Labor's haphazard approach on industry policy, which delivers actually no guarantees for local workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further evidence of the politically motivated 'jobs for the boys' agenda was announced in the budget, with the government doubling the authority's budget to nearly $400 million from 2023-24 to 2026-27 alone, with further funding to total $1.1 billion over the medium term. The federal government cannot afford to waste $1 billion on Canberra bureaucrats across the Net Zero Economy Authority, the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations and the Fair Work Commission when it has been unable to detail the actions that this authority would perform that are not already being done. Put simply, the case has not been made as to why this change is needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike the Labor government, who have already added more than 36,000 public servants since coming to power, the coalition does not believe that the answer to every problem is more money and more bureaucracy. As others on this side of the chamber have rightly noted, this proposal is a bureaucratic waste which largely mirrors the responsibilities of existing federal and state agencies. The aspects which relate to investment in projects to facilitate the transition to a cleaner economy are already provided for through the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, CEFC, and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, ARENA, and the role of existing mechanisms such as the Major Projects Facilitation Agency. It strikes me that this whole area of chasing net zero is a pit of acronyms—acronyms that most of us, quite frankly, don't care for. The acronyms that Australians know and are dealing with, at the moment, are things like HPB. And, no, that doesn't mean 'happy birthday'. That's what Australians call higher power bills. Or there's WAM—'What about me?' That's what they say in relation to this Labor government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new authority claims to facilitate public and private sector participation and investment in greenhouse gas emissions reduction and net zero transformation initiatives in Australia, including in new industries. This is almost copied and pasted from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation's legislated role to 'facilitate increased flows of finance into the clean energy sector and to facilitate the achievement of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets'. It would seem, on any reading, that this is duplication. Likewise, the role of Arena is to 'improve the competitiveness of renewable energy technologies and increase the supply of renewable energy in Australia and facilitate the achievement of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets'. The level of duplication of the proposed Net Zero Economy Authority's responsibility to promote new investment in the net zero transition and the existing Commonwealth entities is, quite frankly, beyond a joke. Australians deserve better than to have the same thing being done three or four times over at their expense. How many federal agencies tasked with renewable financing does this Labor government actually require?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I highlighted earlier, we know that the proposed national body will be Canberra-centric, which poses additional risks of a top-down approach. After two years of a Labor government that has repeatedly failed to deliver for rural towns and regional cities, such as the Gold Coast, why am I not surprised to see it double-down on this backwards approach to governing? It is also likely that, once established, the federal government will continue to add additional powers and responsibilities to the authority, to support its net zero climate ambitions. So, in speaking to this today, I say it's not about the ambition; it's about the way in which this terrible Labor government is yet again putting bureaucracy first and Australians last.</span>

May was neurofibromatosis, or NF, month. Any child that is impacted by NF is supported by the Children's Tumour Foundation of Australia. The support of the Children's Tumour Foundation of Australia has been bipartisan, and it's wonderful to see that support continue. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Neurofibromatosis affects about one in every 2,000 births—or 13,000 Australians. A couple of months ago, Sarah Murphy came to see me in my Warrnambool office to advocate on behalf of the Children's Tumour Foundation. She has a child with NF, and she made it very clear to me that the wonderful work that the Children's Tumour Foundation does helps and supports her in an extraordinary way. I think all of us in this House would welcome the great role that the Children's Tumour Foundation plays and would all advocate that that role should continue for many, many years to help brave individuals like Sarah Murphy and her child. </span>

One of the key signs I saw that every Australian needs to think about is: no farmers, no food. That's a key message.</span>

We were there to let our city friends know that this is much bigger than politics; it's about people's lives and livelihoods. The ripple effect that this will have on our small and remote regional communities is significant. It will not just affect the community. It will affect our shearers, our truck drivers and every local group and organisation. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  Today we gather to celebrate Western Australia Day, a day that holds deep significance for every one of us who calls this magnificent state home. As someone who was born and raised in Malaysia but proudly calls Western Australia my home, I am profoundly moved by the unique blend of the culture, landscape and community that defines this extraordinary place, from the ancient land and wisdom of the Noongar people to the vibrant multicultural communities that have enriched our society of Western Australia and embody the spirit of unity and resilience. We celebrate our stunning coastline, our vast outback and our thriving city. We honour the pioneers of our industry, the innovators and the everyday heroes whose contributions, big and small, have shaped our shared destiny.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, let us reflect on the value that buys us a commitment to inclusivity, a passion for innovation and unyielding love for this land. It is this spirit that drives us forward and that allows us to grow while staying true to our roots. As we look to the future, let us carry forward the legacy of those who came before us, continuing to build a Western Australia that is prosperous, diverse and welcoming to all. Thank you. Happy Western Australia Day!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  A few weeks ago, along with the Independent member for Wakehurst at the state government level, I co-hosted a forum to discuss the future of public transport and road infrastructure in Warringah in the wake of the state government's scrapping of the beaches link road tunnel that had been the subject of Commonwealth funding. It was a productive forum, with the NSW Minister for Roads, John Graham, and the Parliamentary Secretary for Transport, Marjorie O'Neill, both in attendance and answering questions from constituents. Key areas covered included buses for our best transport options and ongoing issues with congestion. As we know, through immigration pressure there is pressure to densify and build more housing, but with that must come good infrastructure planning and public transport. If not, the system fails. Whilst in many ways transport is a state issue, action is needed at a federal level.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2019, the Australian infrastructure audit ranked the North Sydney-Northern Beaches corridor as the fourth most congested corridor in Sydney's evening peak periods. There are currently two projects for the Northern Beaches on the Infrastructure Australia priority list to help alleviate these issues, but there has been very little progress—the North Sydney to Northern Beaches capacity improvements and the Northern Beaches corridor capacity, Seaforth to Mona Vale. I will continue working on this on behalf of our community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  The Central Coast Mariners have done it. The boys in yellow and blue have pulled off the A-League men's final, this time against Melbourne Victory, three to one, and where better to do it than the spectacular Central Coast Industree Group Stadium? They were supported by thousands of fans from across the region. The stadium was packed to capacity with 21,379 cheering attendees. Just outside the stadium, we had our live site, where hundreds of coasties from every part of the region watched the game live, surrounded by other enthusiastic supporters.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What this win means is that the Mariners have secured an historic treble after taking out the AFC Cup, the premiership and now the A-League men's title championship. These victories demonstrate how hard our club has worked to secure these successes over the last few years. To each and every one of the 29 players, congratulations on your win. What a phenomenal game of football you have all been a part of! The Central Coast is so proud of you. We are behind you 100 per cent, and we'll continue to support you into the future. The Central Coast Mariners have brought our region together. They have united our community with a shared purpose, and that is supporting our Central Coast Mariners. Again, congratulations, boys. Well done to the team coach, Mark Jackson, and a special happy retirement to goalkeeper Danny Vukovic.</span>

This issue is electorate-wide. It's requiring people to visit multiple chemists in vain to secure medications—medications that are not just nice to have but necessary.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hormone replacement therapies and migraine medications have been in short supply this year. I've raised this issue with the minister for health and questioned the shortage of free shingles vaccines for older and vulnerable people under the National Immunisation Program. Some GP-administered shingles vaccine waiting lists are in the several hundreds. While local chemists will offer that vaccine and they have it in supply, it's at a $600-per-user basis. We don't have a shortage of that vaccine, but we have a failure to plan.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Therapeutic Goods Administration manages Australia's access to medications. It's the government's responsibility to ensure they do their job. I would urge the government and the minister that we need to ensure that hormone replacement therapies and migraine medications are available, as well as the shingles vaccine.</span>

It can be lifesaving during bushfires and floods. After years of inertia by the previous government, the Albanese Labor government has taken quick action to tackle these black spots to ease everyday frustrations and ensure there's better communication during natural disasters. </span>

In Macquarie, these were sites like Blaxlands Ridge, Maraylya and Yellow Rock, with funding awarded through the improved mobile coverage round. Rather than welcoming this funding that they failed to deliver, the opposition would have people believe that delivering on our election commitments is a bad thing. The party of car park rorts, sports rorts, the Great Barrier Reef fund and robodebt simply can't believe that a minister would actually make decisions in line with grant funding rules and guidelines.</span>

This is great news for Macquarie residents, as we continue to deliver on our election commitments and tackle mobile black spots.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  I am so glad that the Minister for International Development and the Pacific is sitting at the table and can hear this contribution, because, despite warnings from the coalition and industry bodies, last year Labor and the minister ploughed ahead with unworkable changes to the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility scheme, jeopardising our agricultural industry—he knows it—and our foreign relations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes forced employers to guarantee 30 hours per week. Those whose day jobs actually involved growing the world's best produce knew that there was a deep rooted lack of comprehension of seasonality and how weather can dictate the hours a PALM employer can provide. These flaws were raised in Senate estimates, which are on today; in questions in writing to the minister for the Pacific; and through very strong media advocacy, because it was the wrong way to go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thankfully, it's turned the tide, so he can take this either way. He can take it as a compliment, but he ought not, because he knows that this has led to PALM employers losing employees. The union puppetmasters pulled the same tricks that you'd always expect them to pull under a Labor government. Our complaints sadly fell on deaf ears until last week. Thankfully, the government and the minister have backflipped, but only after seeing a decline of—wait for this—10.2 per cent in short-term workers and 10.4 per cent for all PALM workers in agriculture. From 1 July, growers will now be able to offer 120 hours of work averaged over four weeks to employees. At least thanks for making those changes.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:43</span>):  Last Thursday night Landcare ACT met at Wildbark in Mulligans Flat for the 2024 ACT Landcare Awards. Established by Bob Hawke in 1989, Landcare and its dedicated army of volunteers have taken care of our unique natural environment for 35 years. From removing weeds and pollutants to stabilising riverbanks and planting native species, the work of Landcare is critical to protecting the environment for generations to come.</span>

The winners this year include ACT Venturer Scouts, who won the Woolworths Junior Landcare Award; Zoe McMahon, winner of the NextGen Landcare Award; Antony Cory, winner of the ACT Government Citizen Science Award; Sarah Sharp, winner of the Women in Landcare Award; Bradley Bell and the Murray Lower Darling Rivers Indigenous Nations, winners of the First Nations Landcare Collaboration Award; Callum Brae, winner of the Australian Government Sustainable Agriculture Landcare Award; Bush on the Boundary, winner of the Australian Government Community Partnerships Landcare Award; Vera Kurz, winner of the Australian Government Individual Landcarer Award; and the Climate Factory, highly commended in the Australian Government Climate Innovation Award. I congratulate you all again and thank you for the tireless work you do to protect our environment—work that many are not aware volunteers are doing to protect our precious bush capital.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  A couple of weeks ago we celebrated National Volunteer Week across the country. I take this opportunity to thank the many local volunteer organisations—in particular Nepean Food Services, who provide a fantastic service to so many local community members across Penrith; they've been doing this for 30 years. Ditte and the team at Nepean Food Services also run a local Meals on Wheels provision. I thank every volunteer. It was great.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I went to lunch with the volunteers from Nepean Food Services just the other week. They do tremendous work driving, delivering meals, taking calls, helping in the packing room and also providing social support. What I like most is it's not just about providing meals to people who need them; they actually provide friendship. We know that in our communities a lot of older people in particular are experiencing loneliness as they age in their homes. It's wonderful work that Meals on Wheels provide, and it's so important in today's day and age that we look after our older people. I'm truly grateful we have this great service, like all our volunteer organisations across the community—particularly those providing food because, right now, people need it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  People from the small hamlet of Metcalfe, in my electorate, spoke to me recently about challenges they've got with mobile phone coverage. Unfortunately this is not the first time we've had such a meeting; we've met several times over the years, and they struggled under the previous government to get any attention on their issues. In this meeting they shared a petition they had gathered from local constituents. I'm sharing their experiences of telecommunications.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Metcalfe is part of this beautiful area we have in central Victoria, but unfortunately its geography is challenging. It's at the end of a few mobile phone towers, so, therefore, people struggle with connectivity. In emergency situations people are left stranded. Metcalfe and the surrounding areas are home to sheep- and beef-farming communities. The shire town hall is the designated emergency meeting spot during flood and fire, yet it doesn't have decent connectivity; there's no mobile phone coverage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the 53 individual case studies I've had, we couldn't get traction from the previous government. That is why they welcome, like I welcome, this government's plan—the Better Connectivity Plan for Regional and Rural Australia. We are particularly looking forward to the findings of the independent audit into mobile coverage and better identification of blackspots and guides of investment priorities. They hope that will help finally deliver them the coverage they need.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  Today I rise to thank and celebrate all the magnificent people who made my first Seniors Expo, held in Mornington on 24 May, such an awesome day. Over 40 per cent of the population of my electorate of Flinders is aged over 55; it makes my residents wise, compassionate, caring and civic spirited.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was fitting, therefore, that the expo was opened by the magnificent Bruce Turner, the president of the Rosebud RSL subbranch, who makes ageing both purposeful and fun. For 30 years Bruce and his team of volunteers have clocked up thousands of hours carrying out veteran welfare. More than 400 people came along to the Peninsula Theatre to hear all about their local services, ranging from residential care to real estate, banking and Centrelink, leisure, travel, Dromana Bowls and Boomers Life Coaching, as well as home help, mobility assistance and a variety of healthcare services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The wonderful team at Bendigo Bank and the ACCC gave a vital presentation on avoiding scams, and Peninsula Health spoke about elder abuse. There was a full house for presentations by Services Australia and the residents of retirement villages. The Country Women's Association came to the party, baking fresh scones and sandwiches for morning tea and lunch, and there was singing by the Southern Sounds Chorus. The sponsors were numerous and generous, and I thank you all: Belle Property; Tully's; BlueScope; Village Glen; Regis Aged Care; Classic Denture Studio; Kieser physio; Marshalls and Dent; Mornington Travel; Prestige InHome Care; My Care Path; Ritchies IGA; Freedom Wealth Solutions; Audika Hearing Clinic; and RCA Villages.</span>

It's a fabulous day where we get to celebrate all things Western Australian. While I am bummed that I don't get to celebrate it in WA, instead I get to beat the proud Western Australian drum right here in the national capital.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 1 June in 1829, the Swan River Colony began. That colony became Perth, and I'm proud to be the member for Swan. Swan punches well above its weight when we look at state icons. There are some icons that people might know and some that people might not know. We have the South Perth Foreshore, but do people know about Garvey Park? We have the Perth Zoo, but we also have Jirdarup Bushland. We have the Sam Kerr Football Centre, but what about Squash WA? Curtin University is an amazing uni, and we also have the Construction Futures Centre. We have Optus Stadium as well as Hartfield Park. And, while many Western Australians will go shopping at Westfield Carousel Shopping Centre, what about our DFO? We also have Australia's biggest pub, the Camfield, which has a playground right next to it, but what about Tomato Lake and Tomato Lake Cafe? It's pretty amazing!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are things that are deeply Western Australian, and I want Swan electors to know that I'm deeply Western Australian and that I'll continue to ensure that we keep our fair share of the GST. Our Prime Minister has been to WA 20 times; he knows what Western Australians want, and we will keep our fair share of the GST.</span>

Shane's ability to document life's ups and downs and to preserve meaningful memories and special moments alongside those times of hardship is an important one for now and for posterity. His photographs capture perfectly the unique moments of life, ensuring that future generations have an enduring visual connection to the past.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:52</span>):  All of us come into this chamber and talk up our electorates. It's part of our job, and we do it because we're proud of the places we represent. I'm privileged to work with so many different leaders in a very diverse community. That word, 'diversity', means different things to different people. When I think of diversity in Moreton, I see a community rich in different ethnicities and cultures, one where diverse groups work together, support each other and celebrate shared values. But it's not a perfect community because, in Moreton, in the Treasurer's seat of Rankin and in the Speaker's seat of Oxley, racism is something that people can face in the shopping aisles. We've worked with our communities over the years towards building acceptance and understanding, even on the things we might disagree on, whether those be religious legislation, marriage equality or migration changes.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't see anything wrong with that. But I'll tell you what is wrong: elected representatives who cannot see that they have the responsibility as leaders in their communities to bring people together. If you don't understand that, you should check your privilege and your politically mercenary heart in at the door.</span>

As we head into the winter months, I want to praise a partnership that is lending a hand to those most in need in the northern part of my electorate. Wests Group Macarthur has joined forces with Big Yellow Umbrella for the Yellow Hampers food relief program this winter. Together, they will aim to fill plates, ensuring that no-one in the Macarthur region goes hungry during these cold and challenging winter months.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost-of-living crisis looms large over our community. Higher interest rates, increased rental payments and soaring grocery bills have pushed many to seek support from organisations like Big Yellow Umbrella. Just the other day I spoke with the chief operations officer, Kim Landouw, who aptly described the current struggle of so many when she said: 'The cost of living has meant local families cannot afford fresh fruit and vegetables. We are inundated with requests for support.' In response to that pressing need, the Yellow Hampers food relief program are doing what they can to provide support, but they're struggling to meet the needs growing in the community. Only last week, they cancelled 37 family hampers due to a lack of funds for food. Staff at charities and food banks like Big Yellow Umbrella are seeing many people visit for support services, and they need every bit of support they can get.</span>

Perhaps a tin ear would be the best present for the 2014 budget anniversary—a tin ear in smoking cigars to celebrate austerity when people were doing it tough. Contrast this with 2024, when tax cuts were delivered that benefited all people—including those on low incomes, who were going to miss out on tax cuts entirely under the opposition's plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2014 budget represented a tin ear in slashing health funding, winding back hospital funding agreements by $50 billion over eight years and asking patients to pay $7 for a bulk-billed appointment. It was not surprising, given the health minister at the time was rated the worst in 35 years by a survey of over a thousand doctors. Contrast this with a budget that invests in cheaper medicines and bulk-billing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps aluminium would be the best gift for the 2014 anniversary. Aluminium represents flexibility. Yet what an ironic gift for a budget built on ideological inflexibility, a budget built on cuts and slashed funding even when the incoming government had explicitly promised to protect people's benefits! Aluminium would be a better gift for the 2024 budget. It has been described as the original critical mineral. Aluminium is a symbol of the 2024 budget's investment in the economy's capacity to extract and process critical minerals for the future. The best anniversary gift for the 2014 budget would be an aluminium rubbish bin with a heavy tin lid.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:57</span>):  I rise to voice my complete disbelief regarding this government's failure to support the Australian wine and grape-growing sector. Governments across the world are helping wine grape growers to restructure their local industry and address the supply and demand imbalance within the global wine market, but here in Australia this Labor government is trying to mislead growers into believing their future lies in the wine markets of China. That's not where this issue is going to be solved. This is an act of either gross dishonesty or rampant ignorance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that the current surplus of Australian wine is about 10 times what we sold to China pre the COVID peak, and the market today is very different than it was then. Wine consumption in China is about half what it was pre-COVID—in fact, around the world there are fewer drinkers and they're drinking less wine. The Australian wine industry can't trade its way out of this crisis. By ignoring the industry's calls for assistance—the minister doesn't even know the calls exist—the government has not only hamstrung an industry that wants to move forward sustainably but turned its back on regional communities like those in the Riverland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite fail to understand that, when you allow farmers to go broke, regional towns die. From our sheep farmers to our wine grape growers, this Labor government is killing the regions.</span>

If it's anything like last week, the answer is 'zero'. What they don't want to know is that, for the second time, our Treasurer has handed down a budget that delivers a surplus. And, importantly, our budget delivers tax cuts for every Australian taxpayer, not just some. In fact, 85 per cent of taxpayers in my electorate will be far better off under Labor's tax cuts than if the coalition had got their way. Our budget delivers energy price relief for every single household, not just some. It delivers the largest investment in housing that we've seen from a government in decades: $32 billion. It delivers by strengthening Medicare, with more investment in women's health. We've also added 29 urgent care clinics to the 58 that we've already delivered, including one in Belmont in my region. There's also a much-needed boost in rent assistance—the first back-to-back increase in more than 30 years. We're investing in a future made in Australia, with significant investment in training tradies, with an extra 300,000 fee-free TAFE places and funding that is securing our transition to renewables.</span>

When the minister was asked on Thursday by Sky's Kieran Gilbert why two murderers released from immigration detention were not being electronically monitored, the minister responded that he was 'using drones to keep track of these people'—'We know where they are.' What was the basis of the advice that led to this latest example of gross incompetence?</span>

In our first 12 months, we delivered the biggest cut to the price of medicines in the 75-year history of the PBS, saving general patients more than $20 million each and every month. And, in our first 18 months, we finally allowed doctors to prescribe a range of common medicines for chronic conditions for 60 days' supply, rather than just 30, saving patients time and even more money.</span>

                  </a>  All along we have been committed to a triple bottom line in community pharmacy: cheaper medicines for patients, better health care for patients and, importantly, a strong community pharmacy sector. That is why we reinvested every single dollar the Commonwealth saved under 60-day scripts back into community pharmacies.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year, for example, for the first time, pharmacies are able to deliver flu shots to pensioners and shingles vaccines to pensioners completely free of charge, paid for by the Commonwealth. It's also why we agreed to bring forward negotiations for a new agreement. Today, we delivered on that commitment, signing a new five-year agreement with the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. This new agreement makes medicines even cheaper again, by freezing medicine co-payments for patients for up to five years, increasing the number of free medicine Webster-paks that pharmacies can deliver by 50 per cent, paid for by the Commonwealth. Importantly, this new agreement sets up a strong, secure foundation and future for the thousands of community pharmacies—hardworking pharmacists all across the country—who play such an important role in the health of our nation.</span>

This was a robust negotiation, and so it should be when you're trying to achieve a triple bottom line. Those opposite would have had us give up at the first hint of pressure. Those opposite would have had us leave patients high and dry, as they did in government time and time again, making them pay more for their medicines, not less. But we were determined to deliver an agreement that was good for patients and good for community pharmacy, and today we delivered on that commitment.</span>

What it tells us is that his real target is the record of the Leader of the Opposition here, because he knows, as we know, that, if the Leader of the Opposition were held to the standard that he seeks to hold others to, he would not have lasted a day in the job. This is a bloke who trashed our immigration system, who trashed integrity, who trashed enforcement and who let nearly 1,300 people out not via a court and not via a tribunal, without any constraints on their behaviour. That's the measure of the man.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="R36" type="MemberAnswer">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:10</span>):  I thank the member for Werriwa for her question and for her ongoing concern about the people of south-west Sydney having their cost-of-living pressures alleviated by government actions, and that's precisely what we have done. The government's cheaper medicines policy has already saved Australians more than $370 million on the cost of their medicines. Overwhelmingly, that has gone to benefiting low- and middle-income earners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we took the next step, signing the Eighth Community Pharmacy Agreement, not only to make sure that cheaper medicines are here to stay but also to help pharmacists deliver more health services in their local communities. All up, the deal is worth $26.5 billion over five years. It includes a range of measures, including the freezing of PBS co-payments—delivering that cost-of-living relief—for one year for every single person with a Medicare card but for five years for pensioners and concession card holders. That means cheaper medicines will stay cheaper, not rise with inflation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Community pharmacists, of course, are such trusted and valued members of our community. Australians rely on them for advice and for support, and today I spoke to one of my local pharmacists, Adele Tahan, who is the vice-president of the Pharmacy Guild. She certainly welcomed the delivery of this support. We're making sure that community pharmacies can continue to play that vital role, including through dosing advice and assistance for people who take multiple medications to ensure that they're taking the right dose at the right time and avoiding mistakes and waste.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're increasing the regional pharmacy maintenance allowance. We're building on actions that the government took in our first two years. Sixty-day prescriptions—remember them? Those opposite opposed them day after day, week after week, month after month. They said it would lead to the shutting down of pharmacies. Well, today pharmacists have signed up to 60-day prescriptions. We've established 58 Medicare urgent care clinics, with another 29 on the way, and we've tripled the bulk-billing incentive. Labor built Medicare, and we will always protect it and we will always strengthen it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year marks 10 years since the infamous 2014 budget, a budget that tried to establish a GP tax, that cut $50 billion from hospital funding and that wanted to increase the cost of pharmaceuticals. The contrast is clear. This side of the House is standing up for patients and for farmers. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In a cost-of-living crisis, rooftop solar and home batteries can save thousands on bills and reduce emissions. Last week, the first low-interest loans under the Household Energy Upgrades Fund were announced, but these loans represent just six per cent of the $1 billion promised. How much of the remaining $940 million will be delivered before the next election?</span>

The opportunity to assist households in delivering more renewable energy for themselves and, where possible, storage through a battery is a very real one for reducing bills and reducing emissions. That's why we allocated $1 billion in the last budget. The honourable member is correct: last Friday, I opened, with the assistant minister, round 1, which is a $60 million allocation to the provider Plenti. Its interest rates are between 2.74 per cent and 3.3 per cent. That's a discount off their standard green loan for things like solar panels, batteries, EV charging at home, efficient air-conditioning and others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is appropriate that the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which is delivering this program on behalf of the government, has engaged in very strong due diligence to ensure value for taxpayers and due diligence in terms of the providing partners. They opened applications for partnerships last December. They closed in March. I was pleased to announce the first round last week. I expect to make other announcements in coming weeks and months. This is very much the first. There is much more to do. We intend to get many of these rounds out the door as soon as possible and to see that $1 billion allocated and spent in providing these concessional loans to families. We will see what the take-up rate is. It is a demand driven program. In that respect, we have to see the take-up. I assure the honourable member that I'll keep her updated, but we intend to roll out the scheme and see it work to help households deliver themselves renewable energy which will reduce their bills and emissions.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Watson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Minister for the Arts and Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:16</span>):  I thank the member for Boothby for the question. In the seat of Boothby, like in every electorate, every taxpayer is now counting down the days to when every taxpayer gets a tax cut. Every award worker now knows that on the same date, 1 July, they've got a pay rise heading their way. It's a 3.75 per cent increase, which means, once again, we have an annual wage review that is making sure that people are keeping in front of inflation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Remember that the annual wage review was one of the great controversies during the election campaign. When the Leader of the Opposition, as he then was, and now Prime Minister of Australia said that we were committed to making sure that low-paid workers didn't go backwards, those opposite described it as a 'dangerous policy' for Australia. They can't say, 'That was just a policy of the Morrison government,' because even this morning the words from Senator Hume were that, if low-paid workers got real wages growth, that would be the worst thing for Australia. There is a unity ticket between Senator Hume and the member for Hume, who previously argued that he opposed our laws because they would push up wages. The Leader of the Opposition opposed them because, as he said, they were going to result in higher wages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of this, we now have had three annual wage reviews that have been brought down in the space of two years. In those two years, under Prime Minister Albanese, we have had a greater increase in the minimum wage than those opposite had in their entire decade in office. In two years, the minimum wage has gone up by more than it did under those opposite in their entire time in office. For full-time workers, the combination of the pay rise and the tax cuts means retail workers are about to have $102 a week extra in their bank accounts and cleaners are about to have $103 a week extra in their bank accounts. Because of the combination of the pay rise and the tax cuts, on 1 July hairdressers will get $106 a week extra in their bank accounts. Minimum wage workers will get $120 a week extra in their bank accounts. Aged-care workers, because of the work that this government has done in supporting a pay rise for aged-care workers, are getting $200 a week extra in their bank accounts. This government said it would get wages moving. Those opposite want people to work longer for less, while this government wants people to earn more and keep more of what they earn.</span>

She has spent her entire working life championing the cause of the low paid in this country, and I acknowledge that work. We welcome the decision of the Fair Work Commission to increase minimum wages by 3.75 per cent. This is the real wage increase that low-paid workers need and deserve. This is a win for 2.6 million workers and their loved ones. This means workers on the minimum wage get an extra $33.10 a week and $1,721 more per year. This means more money in the pockets of our lowest paid workers and more help with the cost of living.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our economic plan is all about helping people earn more and keep more of what they earn. We see decent wages as part of the solution to the cost-of-living challenge, not part of the problem. It's why we're getting wages moving again. It's why we're fighting inflation. It's why we're delivering a tax cut for every Australian taxpayer. Real wages were falling when we came to office, and now they are growing again. Nominal wages have been growing almost twice as fast under us as they were growing under those opposite. They've grown faster than four per cent annual for three consecutive quarters now, and that didn't happen once under those opposite, when they were pursuing a policy of deliberate wage suppression, which gave us a decade of wage stagnation, a defining feature of their economic mismanagement.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know people are still under pressure and the economy is soft. Treasury's forecasts anticipate weak growth in our economy, and we expect to see that in the national accounts on Wednesday. That's why our budget is about helping people with the cost of living and getting the budget in better nick without smashing the economy. A slash-and-burn budget would have been dead wrong in these circumstances, when growth is soft and people are already hurting. That's why our balanced approach and our responsible economic management is bang on. It fights inflation. It takes weak growth into account. It gets wages growing again, and it puts people front and centre. That's why today's decision to ensure our lowest paid workers don't go backwards is so welcome.</span>

I want to wish his aged-care residents and his aged-care workers, alongside himself, a very happy WA Day, which I'm told is a very big deal. From our very first day in government, we have been working for older Australians and for the people who care for them. We're working on putting nurses back into nursing homes and working on making sure that older people have the care that they need with the quality that they deserve. We're working on making sure that our dedicated aged-care workers are paid fairly for the crucial and highly skilled work that they perform.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The May budget marks a 30 per cent increase in funding for aged care under the Albanese government since our first budget in October 2022. In this budget, there's a further $2.2 billion to help people stay at home for longer, with more home care packages to upgrade digital infrastructure, to improve regulation and to attract more workers. The work we're doing is already having a hugely positive impact for older people and for the dedicated carers looking after them. Today there is a registered nurse on site in aged care 98.88 per cent of the time on average in Australia. Older Australians are receiving an additional 3.6 million minutes of care every single day. Workers are being paid more than they ever have before after a 15 per cent increase to award wage minimums—an $11.3 billion investment in the people who dedicate their working lives to caring for older Australians. Of course, we know there is more to come with the final decision of the independent Fair Work Commission on stage 3 of the work value case on top of a tax cut for every single aged-care worker from 1 July.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After the budget, I went to Far North Queensland to talk with aged-care residents, with aged-care workers and with a home-care recipient about their experiences in aged care. I met a remarkable young worker named Clyde at Edge Hill Orchards in Manoora, in the member for Leichhardt's electorate. Clyde was brought up by his mum and his grandma, and his strong family values drew him to working in aged care. So he started working as a personal care worker at Edge Hill Orchards with his mum, Tracey, who works in the kitchen. Clyde told me that his pay rise, supported and funded by the Albanese government, helped him to get his certificate III, something that he had been struggling to do before the pay rise. Clyde now wants to go on and do a certificate IV and then eventually get his bachelor's, all while continuing his career in aged care, preferably at Edge Hill. That is what we have been working towards. That is who we have been working for—people like Clyde. The Albanese government has been working for people like Clyde and the residents he so passionately cares for, and we will continue to do that, delivering the positive change aged care has needed for so long.</span>

We continue to deport people who have no right to be here. Since coming to government, we've deported over 4,200 individuals from immigration detention. That stands in stark contrast to one of the people who were sworn in as home affairs minister. On the Leader of the Opposition's watch, almost 1,300 hardcore criminals were released from immigration detention centres, not because of a High Court decision—not because he had to do it. They were released without any curfews, ankle bracelets, monitoring or regard for community safety. It included 102 sex offenders, 40 domestic violence offenders and four murderers, alleged murderers or accessories to murder.</span>

This government's No. 1 priority is cost-of-living relief for every Australian, and that's why we introduced our Cheaper Child Care reforms in our very first year—reforms, I might remind the House, that those opposite said were unnecessary but reforms that have reduced out-of-pocket expenses by, on average, 11 per cent on average for centre based care and that provide cost-of-living relief for more than one million Australian families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud of what the Albanese Labor government has achieved in our two years of office. But we know that there is more to do to reach our vision of an affordable, accessible and inclusive early childhood education and care system. The Productivity Commission and the ACCC have told us that we can't reach that vision without a sustainable and stable workforce. And we know that the key to this is wages, because, as early childhood workers tell me all the time, 'We love what we do, but love doesn't pay the bills.' That's why we passed legislation to get wages moving and close the gender pay gap. That's why we've advocated for a wage increase in three annual wage review decisions since we came to government. From next month, that means a further 3.7 per cent pay rise for early childhood workers. We've also provisioned funding in this year's budget for a wage increase for early childhood workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's not all, because our tax cuts will bring further cost-of-living relief. That means, on average, $829 for the average early childhood educator and $1,404 for the average early childhood teacher. That will go back into the pockets of the people who do some of the most important work in our society.</span>

Donald Trump has repeatedly said that immigrants are 'poisoning the blood of America', a phrase with a very dark history, and that 'they're not humans; they're animals'. He wants to wreck climate action, and last week he also said that the judge who convicted him was corrupt. Prime Minister, isn't it clear that this man is a danger to democracy, to Australia and to the world? Will you join us in condemning Donald Trump and commit to a full review of Australia's relationship with the US if this dangerous man is elected President?</span>

                  </a>  The starting point for everything in question time is for ministers to be asked about ministerial responsibility. I suggest that if we go down the path of this question then the whole premise for question time falls over. I'd suggest moving to the next question as an option.</span>

                  </a>  It is an option, but I try to be fair and I try to allow every member to ask their question. Obviously, when a statement is made by another person or world leader, the Prime Minister or any other minister cannot be responsible for it. You can't ask an opinion under the standing orders. I'm going to allow the Leader of the Australian Greens, as I've done with other members, to rephrase the question to ensure that any question he asks is relevant to the Prime Minister or minister's responsibilities.</span>

One of my priorities upon being sworn in was to repair and improve relations internationally, right around the globe. That is something that I have done. If you look at the relationship with the United States and the United Kingdom, they are two historic relationships that have been important for us—the United Kingdom, of course, for a long period of time, given our history, and the United States particularly in the wake of John Curtin's correct and courageous decision to put the national defence of Australia first during World War II and the important alliance we have had with the United States of America since then. That relationship is a relationship not between leaders; it's a relationship between people and between nations. It's one that is very important and enduring and will continue to be into the future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, we've repaired our relationships with countries like France and with other countries in Europe. We've got as good a relationship as we have ever had with the ASEAN nations; a priority has been our region. Hosting the ASEAN-Australia Forum in Melbourne in March and seeing the leader of every ASEAN nation come personally and participate fully in that forum was very positive. Similarly, our relationship with the Pacific Islands Forum has been so important as well.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that, coming up, we will have CHOGM, hosted in Samoa. That will be an important time for us to renew our relationship with Commonwealth nations. In addition to that, in a short period of time we will welcome the Premier of China to Australia. We'll make announcements at appropriate times about that. That will be a positive thing, given that China is our major trading partner and given the important regional relationships. We do have strategic competition. We are attempting to manage that competition in Australia's national interest, always speaking up for our national interest. We'll continue to do that in a mature way that represents our nation's interests. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The Albanese government's No. 1 priority is providing cost-of-living relief for every Australian. We know that many families are under pressure, and our government is working hard to deliver meaningful relief without adding to inflation. On 1 July, 1.3 million low- and middle-income families will see their family tax benefit payment rates increase after indexation is applied. Nearly one million pensioners will also benefit from the increases to income and asset limits, meaning that they can have higher incomes and assets before their pensions are affected. In addition, income eligibility for paid parental leave will increase on 1 July, taking the family income threshold to just over $364,000.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regular indexation of payments and thresholds is an important part of a strong social safety net. For Australians accessing support when they need it, indexation is there to keep pace with the cost of living. Unfortunately, this view is not shared by everyone. It is unfortunate that we now have the member for Hume suggesting that, if he were Treasurer, he would cut this so-called unrestrained spending which of course includes the cost of indexing family payments. Those opposite do have a track record of letting family payments stagnate, with back-to-back indexation freezes when they were last in government, and of course they also tried to stop parents from accessing both their government and employer paid parental leave, labelling them as 'double dippers'. While those opposite will seek to deny families the payment they deserve, we will get on with the job of delivering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as applying indexation on 1 July, our government will mark that date with an historic expansion of paid parental leave. Detailed in the budget, we announced that we will pay superannuation on this leave from July next year. Superannuation on paid parental leave is a critical step to ensuring parents who take time off work after the birth or adoption of a child do not retire with less. Of course, 330,000 low- and middle-income families with dependent children will also benefit with a further 10 per cent increase to the maximum rate of rent assistance—our second consecutive increase in two budgets. When it comes to the cost of living, we're also delivering a tax cut for every taxpayer and energy bill relief to every household. It is the Albanese government that looks after families. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  For example, in February 2019, the AAT decided that a Congo-born man who had convictions for a sex offence involving a girl aged under 14, and for repeatedly breaching his bail conditions, should be allowed to stay in Australia. The decision cited ministerial direction 65. What did the current opposition leader do? Absolutely nothing. It's alleged that this individual then went on to reoffend. These allegations are serious in nature: domestic violence, torture, assault while armed, assault while occasioning bodily harm and deprivation of liberty. The victims were his own children, including his five-year-old son, who was left in a coma. He was arrested and is currently in remand, pending a trial. The Leader of the Opposition did nothing. This minister for immigration has cancelled his visa.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMahon</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Climate Change and Energy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:52</span>):  I thank my honourable friend for the question. What a champion for regional Australia the member for Bendigo is. The member for Bendigo knows that the Albanese government's coal and gas caps, together with the rebates in the budget before last, have worked to put downward pressure—real downward pressure—on prices, which we saw reflected in the default market offer just a couple weeks ago. That has been followed of course by the $300 rebates which go to every single energy bill in the country from the Treasury's budget delivered just a few weeks ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we also know that renewables are the cheapest form of energy and that getting more renewable energy into the grid is good for prices. And we aren't the only ones who know that; that is understood by governments around the world. Last year, 130 countries signed a pledge to triple renewable energy by 2030—that's 130 countries tripling renewable energy by 2030.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The honourable member asked me what policies are being rejected at home and abroad. The answer is, of course, the most expensive form of energy. This is a very important point, because that is nuclear energy, and we've had a lot of misinformation from honourable members opposite. The leader of the National Party is keen to say: 'Look at America. Look at what's happening in America.' Well, what's happening in America is the cancellation of a small modular reactor after a 70 per cent cost blowout; that's what's happening in America! We've had the member for Hinkler and our old friend the member for New England saying that we are the only OECD country without nuclear power. In fact there are 16 OECD countries without nuclear power—16. But the Leader of the Opposition himself says, and he says this all the time, 'Australia is the only country of the G20 which hasn't got nuclear power as part of its energy mix, or which hasn't committed to doing so as part of its domestic energy mix.' We've all heard him say it repeatedly. The G20 is a very important organisation, and a key member of the G20 is Germany—the third- or fourth-largest economy in the world, depending on the measure. They closed their last nuclear power station last year, in April. The Chancellor of Germany said, 'Nuclear energy is over; it's a dead horse.'</span>

Look, it was a nice try, but I had been specific with the member for Wannon about the process. We cannot have a situation where people get up and debate a point of order with relevance. Question time has never worked like that. It's not going to start like that. The member for Fairfax will leave the chamber for abuse of standing orders.</span>

                  </a>  Another country in the G20 is Italy. Italy banned nuclear power in 1987 after a referendum. To be fair, they did have another go in 2011 and held another referendum and found 94 per cent of voters against nuclear power in Italy. I don't think that's a commitment to get nuclear power in Italy, which is also in the G20. The opposition could clear all this up. They could clear it up by releasing their policies and their costings and start telling the truth about nuclear power, not misleading little grabs. Tell the truth and release your policies. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

There are now 422 medications on the TGA medicine shortage report list. These include blood thinners, medications for glaucoma and HRT patches. My constituents can't access the Novavax and Shingrix vaccines. Medication shortages in this country are getting worse; they are not getting better.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Health and Aged Care and Deputy Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:57</span>):  I thank the member for Kooyong for her question. I will deal with Novavax and Shingrix perhaps first. As the member knows, the Novavax original vaccine was finally approved and made available a couple of years ago in Australia. Take up was pretty low and it dropped off very quickly. The original vaccine was withdrawn from the market more than 12 months ago in Australia because, essentially, Novavax stopped making it. As the member probably knows, the Omicron version of the vaccine has been considered by TGA for registration here in Australia over some time. I'm advised, a few weeks ago, Novavax decided to withdraw that application for registration. I encouraged Novavax to continue working with the TGA. We would like to see as many COVID vaccines on the market as possible but, ultimately, that is a matter for the company.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of Shingrix, we have the most comprehensive shingles vaccine program in the world. The take-up by older Australians was phenomenal and about 40 per cent higher than we projected using the usual forecasting models. As a result, we negotiated the supply of an additional 750,000 doses of the Shingrix vaccine, which has already been delivered over recent weeks to all of the state and territory governments. That should be hitting vaccination points, GP surgeries and pharmacies pretty much as we speak, and we have another 400,000 as well being delivered in May and June, so we hope that some of those supply issues should be resolved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member, though, points to a broader challenge that countries around the world are having right now in a global market with the supply of a range of really important medicines. The TGA works with those sponsors to try and resolve those supply concerns. We work with doctors and pharmacies where possible to arrange alternatives to a medicine that might be in global supply shortage. We do that as much as we can. The number of medicines in short supply now is around 400, as the member says. Before COVID, when the mandatory reporting regime started in 2019, it was in the order of 300 to 400, so it's certainly a little higher but not phenomenally higher. But I'm still very concerned about this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I finish by saying this as well. The Minister for Industry and Science today is at BIO 2024, the largest biotech conference in the world, promoting our Future Made in Australia policy because we want to make more medicines and vaccines here, which is why medicines and medtech are a priority area for the National Reconstruction Fund. We've seen manufacturing drop off over the last decade or decade and a half. We want to turn that around and make sure that we're making more of those medicines here in Australia and we have our own sovereign capability.</span>

The budget wipes about $3 billion of HECS debt for more than three million Australians. That includes more than 21,000 people in the member for Fremantle's electorate. What this means is that, if you've got an average HECS debt of 26 grand, then your debt will be cut by about $1,200. If you've got a debt of $45,000, it will be cut by $2,000. If you've got a HECS debt of $60,000, it will be cut by around $2,700.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Fremantle asks me about cost-of-living relief for teaching, nursing and social work students. The budget includes for the first time ever financial support for those students to help them while they do their prac, the practical part of their degree. A lot of students have told me that, when they do their prac, they've often got to give up their part-time job. Sometimes they've got to move away from home. For a lot of people, that can mean delaying finishing their degree or not finishing it at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need more teachers, we need more nurses, we need more midwives and we need more social workers. These are people who've signed up to do the most important jobs in this country: to educate our kids, to look after us when we're ill or when we're old, to help women during childbirth, to help support women in domestic violence refuges. That's why this is important. It's a bit of practical support for people while they do their practical training.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was at a hospital not far from here with the member for Canberra last week, and we met a nursing student named Anne. She told us that she has to move to regional New South Wales to do her prac. It means she has to move away from her family and she has to pay rent at two places at once. She broke it down like this: 'Placements are an expensive cost to students. Sometimes you have to travel to rural placements, and we're out of pocket. So we're effectively paying for placement and, unfortunately, that invaluable experience doesn't pay our bills. So our bills don't stop. So this is a fabulous incentive.' I got this email the other day from Natalie, a teaching student at Western Sydney University: 'I didn't actually think the government would make major changes in the way that they have with HECS and paid prac. This will be incredibly helpful for me, my levels of stress and my bank account.'</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are important reforms. The changes to HECS will help with the cost of degrees. The new paid prac will help with the cost of living. They'll help to train more teachers, nurses, midwives and social workers. It's all a fundamental part of building a future made right here in Australia.</span>

People in the electorate of Lalor will welcome the decision today by the Fair Work Commission for a 3.75 per cent increase; because inflation is running at 3.6, that means it's a real wage increase. The minimum wage now is $24.10 per hour, a $3.77 increase since we came to office, more than $140 extra per week. It took the now opposition their entire wasted decade in office to lift the minimum wage by as much as we have in just the two years in which we have been in office. As a direct result of what we have done, 2.6 million workers will benefit—more money in their pockets.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm asked about alternatives. We know what those opposite's attitude is, because this morning they were out there—Senator Hume—saying that it would be the worst thing if low-paid workers got real wages growth. But that's consistent with what the Leader of the Opposition said when he voted against our IR legislation because it would result in higher wages. Well, we support working people getting ahead. It's just like in the election campaign, where we had the dollar coin. I brought it out in the election campaign, and, when asked if I would welcome people on the minimum wage not going backwards, I said, 'Absolutely.' I stand by that, and we've done that in government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But of course it's not just higher wages; we want people to earn more and to keep more of what they earn. And on 1 July both of those things will happen, both of them opposed by those opposite, who have never supported a wage increase, who supported low wage growth as a key feature of their economic architecture and who, when we proposed changing the tax cuts to deliver for working people, including for those earning under $45,000 a year, said that they'd roll it back, that they'd reverse it, that we should have an election on it—before they voted for it. We know that they are not concerned with the living standards of working people. How out of touch they are, which is why they've opposed all of our cost-of-living measures. On that note, I ask that further questions be placed on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:11</span>):  Yes, it's fantastic to be back on my feet following a short break in proceedings on these bills. We've all had the chance to think more about the bureaucracy that would be created through this new Net Zero Economy Authority. Of course, I'll return to some very obvious questions about this authority and whether or not the government, for example, will rule out giving this authority new powers to streamline or expedite regulatory approvals or financing for transformational green energy projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another issue, besides the bureaucratic waste, is the pattern of Labor's meaningless slogan-making. The government is long on rhetoric and short on delivery. We know that funding for renewable energy projects is also expected to come from the newly badged Future Made in Australia. Can we expect similarly meaningless spin that lacks substance there as well? While Labor has gifted $13 billion in taxpayer funded subsidies to big business in the green energy sector so far, what do we have to show for it? The fact is that we're in a cost-of-living crisis and that Labor's policy mix is not making life better for Australians. In fact, most Australians are asking, 'Why is this government not focusing on me?' Labor's focus should be on dealing with high energy costs, high inflation and out-of-control red tape rather than focusing on creating new bureaucracies. Instead, Labor continually fails to address the fundamental realities facing most Australian residents and businesses. With insolvencies at record highs and more businesses going offshore, supporting a small number of big businesses is irresponsible and is a slap in the face for small businesses desperately seeking answers from this government simply in order to survive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the second major component of the proposed authority's remit, the Energy Industry Jobs Plan, we find, once again, a union wish-list item being enshrined by their servants at the expense of the taxpayer. Australia's current industrial framework features a well-established safety net that applies, and has applied, for a considerable amount of time to instances of business closure and industry change—especially relating to the closure of coal-fired power stations. We know the AEMC's National Electricity Rules already mandate a minimum of 3½ years notice before coal-fired power stations are able to be closed, giving sufficient for the employees to transition. Furthermore, a national agency to assist regional employees on energy projects also duplicates state based mechanisms to achieve the same outcomes. For example, regional planning initiatives already exist through the New South Wales government's Hunter Regional Plan 2041 and the Victorian government's Latrobe Valley Authority Transition Plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition is also of the view that the proposed new authority would undermine the work of existing Regional Development Australia committees, which recognise that different approaches must be tailored for different parts of Australia. A Canberra-centric view simply doesn't work. The proposed Energy Industry Jobs Plan's process overlaps significantly with existing industrial obligations, including consultation, paid leave, union access and enforcement, without dealing with how those overlapping obligations should interact. This bill takes no steps to harmonise features which will cause confusion, uncertainty and disputation at the workplace level that could otherwise be avoided. The pursuit of guaranteeing regional jobs is one of moral conviction, but the meritorious underpinnings of this component are more than overshadowed by the detriment that will flow by handing the unions a stick with which to beat business, promote unrest and ultimately drive union membership.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to note the larger risk in this legislation is not for the large energy corporations like AGL, Origin or Energy Australia but rather for the smaller businesses who supply goods and services to a closing power station that may be caught up in this energy industry jobs plan process. While the big corporates have the benefit of teams dedicated to regulation and compliance, these measures will only serve to cause chaos and confusion for the smaller players in the sector. Once again the Albanese Labor government fails to consider the implications for all Australians and small business. Importantly, while the bills will require employers to offer workers retraining opportunities and attempt to match employees with new jobs in the green economy, this is unlikely to benefit older, experienced workers approaching retirement or workers with highly specialised skill sets. Again it is unsurprising to see the Albanese Labor government leaving behind older Australians, a cohort that have contributed so much to our nation but are often forgotten or lose out when policy is designed by those opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The energy industry jobs plan is bought and paid for by the union movement. The union movement want the Net Zero Economy Authority to be legislated because the authority would be able to collect the personal information of employees of coal-fired power stations, from financial records through to phone numbers. Indeed, these bills do not even require the relevant employees' consent for the information to be passed from their employer on to the Net Zero Economy Authority, and the legally mandated trade union representation is on its board. These bills are not bills for the regions, nor are they bills to support the net zero transition or energy sector workers. These are industrial relations bills that the Labor government are gifting to the union movement. I am pleased to be a member of the coalition which will not be supporting these bills.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:17</span>):  The Greens said very clearly at the election that we owe coal and gas workers in this country a debt of thanks. For many years, coal and gas workers have helped power our country and engage in industries that helped get the country to where it is today. It is not coal and gas workers that anyone should have a problem with; indeed not only do we owe them a debt of thanks, but we here in this place have an obligation to coal and gas workers and their communities to ensure they are not the ones asked to bear the brunt of tackling the climate crisis. In many instances, coal and gas workers live in regions that are going to be some of the hardest hit by the climate crisis. Parts of Queensland and parts of Western Australia stand at risk of becoming close to uninhabitable during the course of this century if we don't get the climate crisis under control. That is the clear evidence from the scientists.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's just that we now know things about coal and gas we didn't know before. We now know coal and gas are products that, when used as intended, cause harm. Coal and gas are the leading causes of the climate crisis. Just as we now say tobacco and asbestos need to be treated as harmful products that cause harm to the community and to individuals when used as intended, so too do we need to say coal and gas are fuelling the climate crisis. Australia has a lot to lose if the climate crisis is not brought under control. According to the previous government's own agency's estimations, farmers are already losing $30,000 a year in income as a result of the climate crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have people in northern New South Wales who still haven't been able to get back into their homes or have them properly retrofitted or modified since the devastating floods. We have people in inner-city Brisbane who now can't insure their homes because of the effects of the climate crisis, plus we have the growing billions of dollars of damage bills after the extreme weather events: the fires, the floods and, of course, the droughts that have been fuelled by coal and gas. So we owe it to people, to workers and to communities to say, 'We are going to protect you from the effects of the climate crisis by getting off coal and gas as quickly as we possibly can and, at the very minimum, not opening new coal and gas projects.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is critical because, according to the scientists, if we're to have any chance of tackling the climate crisis, at a bare minimum, we need to not open a single new coal and gas mine. Then we need to have a managed transition out of coal and gas and onto renewables and storage. If we plan this and accept that these products are now harmful but that it is not the workers or the communities that are not at fault—rather, they need our support—we can make the transition, and do it very quickly, in a way that will ensure prosperity for those communities. That is why, going to the election, the Greens very clearly said, in places like Queensland and in many parts of the country, like here, 'The best job for a coalminer will be another mining job,' because there are critical minerals industries that we can grow. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also said, 'The communities need support.' Communities need support in attracting new businesses and industries, and government can play a very key role in that. The principle should be that the coal and gas workers should be able to move into another job that pays just as well and not suffer financially by virtue of the need to get out of coal and gas. That should be the guiding principle. It's why the Greens took to the election a wage guarantee for coal workers. In that way, you would have a situation where an authority with local worker representation on it could oversee it and say, 'In this area, where we will be getting out of coal, we are going to attract new industries by giving the new employer a subsidy if they take on a worker from a coalmine.' So, if a worker leaves a coalmine and goes and works in a new industry, they don't lose a cent. They have their wage guaranteed. That would attract new industries to the area because they would know they would be getting assistance as well as getting some incredibly skilled and trained workers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you do this, together with substantial government investment in things like publicly owned renewable energy and critical minerals, where the public gets a stake in it—if we're going to be tipping in billions of dollars, we should ensure that there's a return to the public that is doing that—we could make the transition, and make it really clearly, and honour that debt that we owe to coal and gas workers. That is what a proper transition would look like. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen the transition done very, very badly in this country. We've seen industries collapse, with no thought about how to ensure that workers don't lose wages, that they get secure employment and that new government led industry and other industry grows in those communities. That is why we took such a strong position to the election for not only a legislated transition authority but a wage guarantee for workers, plus significant government investment in growing the new industries in those places. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is, unfortunately, not what we're seeing with these bills, the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024 and the Net Zero Economy Authority (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024. We're seeing an increasing trend from Labor of greenwashing. They are saying that they care about the climate crisis and bringing legislation before this place that they say is tackling the climate crisis but then doing something very different. They are opening up more coal and gas mines. Thirteen new projects have been approved in the life of this government, with more in the pipeline. As a result—look at the emissions data that came out on Friday—pollution is actually up under Labor.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what happens when you try to have your foot on the accelerator and the brake at the same time. You say you are going to shift to cut pollution but then you actually pour money into things like the Middle Arm project in the Northern Territory. That is a massive gas subsidy. A big new gas factory is going to be built, with Labor asking the public to put their hands in their pockets to pay for it. Then, you look at this legislation that comes forward saying it is going to create a net zero authority.</span>

                    </a>  The Northern Territory member asked for the full story and then leaves the chamber because he doesn't want to hear it. He doesn't want to hear about how the Northern Territory Labor government has just agreed to underwrite a purchase of gas from the Beetaloo Basin—the Beetaloo climate bomb that we know, if it is lit, will have a country's worth of emissions from it. The Northern Territory Labor government has underwritten that. Do you know what else is part of the full story that the member doesn't want to tell you? At 5.15 pm on the day after this parliament rose after an extended session, where we were talking about gas, do you know what we found out? The environment minister had approved the Beetaloo pipeline and didn't tell the chamber. It was hidden from the department's website for weeks and weeks and weeks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have this government here that says: 'Oh, no, we're moving to net zero. Come and pass this legislation. Please pass it.' Then, it chimes in from the cheap seats and says, 'Why don't you tell the full story?' I'll tell you the full story. The full story is that this Labor government is using public money to expand the gas industry. Gas is as dirty as coal, and the scientists have said, very clearly, that we cannot be expanding new gas projects and new coal projects right now. And what does Labor do? It does this greenwashing: 'Here's a net zero bill.' Do you know what? It doesn't cover the people in the gas mines. It doesn't cover the people in the coalmines. And what does Labor do quietly behind the scenes? They say: 'We'll open up new gas projects. We will use public money to fund a big giant new gas plant in the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory Labor government will then underwrite it using public money, and the environment minister will quietly sign off on the pipeline and not tell the parliament.' That is the full story.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Is any bit of that wrong? No, not one bit of that is wrong, because Labor is sitting here trying to pull the wool over people's eyes. It is crystal clear that Labor are climate frauds, saying they want to tackle the climate crisis while expanding coal and gas. If you are serious about this, read the title of the main bill—I know the member from the Northern Territory has gone very silent now because everything I've said is true—the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill. You would take a whole-of-economy approach. You would say: 'We know we need to get out of coal and gas. We know we can't open new projects,' like Labor wants to do. We can't keep opening these new projects like Labor wants to do. You would say, 'Let's have a plan to ensure that the workers don't lose money and that there are secure jobs in those communities,' but this legislation doesn't do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead, what we see in practice is a Labor government extending the life of a coal-fired power station in Eraring. Faced with a choice of managing the transition, they use public money to extend the life of a coal-fired power station. Even with the narrow category that the bills supposedly apply to, the need for it is rapidly diminishing because Labor is keeping the coal-fired power stations going for longer. All these things should be addressed in the bills, and the member for Solomon, the Northern Territory member, knows it but he has fled the chamber after demanding the truth be told. When the truth was told he didn't like it and left, because he knows, like every Labor member here, that they'll say in their electorates that they care about the climate crisis and then come to Canberra and back more coal and gas. They open up new coal and gas mines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, on top of that, we get the Future Gas Strategy. At the same time the government tells us we have to get to net zero emissions by 2050—too late, but that's the target the government has set itself—it comes and releases a strategy, which it's hidden from these bills, that says we need gas to 2050 and beyond. Are you getting to net zero by 2050? No. You're releasing strategies that say we're going to keep gas in the system to 2050 and beyond. And Labor is approving coalmines that go past 2050. Please stop with the climate fraud where you pretend to care and bring in bits of legislation that have 'net zero' in front of it and then keep opening new coal and gas mines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have said we need a legislated authority. Our version would be much stronger than this one. It would have a much wider remit and it would have money in its pocket to go and drive the transition. That is what we need. That's why we're going to be reserving our position in the Senate on these bills. It is time now for Labor to decide where it stands. If you're serious about getting to zero emissions, then have a plan for the whole of the economy but stop opening up coal and gas mines. You send mixed messages to the communities in the Hunter, the communities in Queensland and the communities in Western Australia when you say, 'We want to tackle the climate crisis' but then back new coal and gas mines. When you back new coal and gas mines and open them up, you suck up workers and capital that could be going to the zero-pollution industries of the future. Pick a lane, Labor. You can work with us to cut climate pollution, but if you keep opening new coal and gas mines you'll be exposed as climate frauds.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HOGAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Page</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:32</span>):  I rise to speak on the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024 and the Net Zero Economy Authority (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024. The title of the main bill, the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024, is a little bit misleading because this bill isn't primarily about net zero and the net zero economy as such. As it is again with Labor, these bills demonstrate so much how little experience there is on the other side of the chamber in making a buck. As the shadow trade and tourism minister, as a local MP in my community, when I walk around talking to anyone who is trying to do anything in this country—whether they're trying to build houses or in a small business, medium business or big business trying to generate wealth or jobs in our economy—the major complaint, without exception, across any sector and any size business is red tape, green tape and bureaucracy speak. We make it so hard to do anything in this country to make us productive, to grow jobs and to grow the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What are these bills doing? What's the essence of these bills? The essence of these bills is basically to create a new authority. Everything they want this authority to do already sits with an executive agency within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. But Labor's go-to on any issue, any policy, is: 'Let's create more of a bureaucracy. Let's create more government employees on taxpayer funded salaries, more bureaucracy, more red tape, more green tape, more everything tape to make things more difficult.' That's what these bills are about—creating another layer, another bureaucracy, to make things more difficult in this sector. That's why we're going to oppose these bills, because they're about more obligations on business, on small, medium-sized and large businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go to the topic in relation to this authority. It already exists; this economy is on the path to net zero 2050. Then, when you read about what they want this authority to do, they say it will 'seek to work with project proponents and state governments to get renewable projects to investment decisions'. Again, everything with this side of politics is about ideology. It's not about practical outcomes; it's about ideology. You look at something through a glass prism and you can't go outside it. As we keep saying, yes, we are on a path to net zero 2050, but that needs to be agnostic about technology. We need to get there in the way that is the cheapest and the most reliable form of energy transmission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Minister for Energy and Climate Change—and whatever else his title is—he is a gift that keeps giving to us. Whenever he gets up, I go: 'Get him up. Let's get him an extension of time.' He's our best asset and he has a history of being a good asset for us as well. He thinks he's clever today because he gets up and he talks about the OECD countries who, he says, don't have nuclear. He says, 'You've distorted the figure.' We talked about 19 of the 20 largest countries in the world who have some nuclear as part of their equation. Look, I like renewables too. We're not about nuclear versus renewables. We are not about renewables versus nuclear, as they are. We want everything to be part of the mix. So how was he clever today? Such a clever little thing! He comes in today and goes, 'All these countries in Europe don't have nuclear.' They don't have nuclear in their country, but guess what? They have transmission grids that come from France. Every European country—or a lot of Western European countries—rely on France and rely on nuclear energy for their power. This is the infantile type of position that this debate is at with that minister. He knows that. He knows that there are so many countries in Europe that are powered by nuclear energy, but, because they don't physically have a nuclear power station, he says they don't have it, so we're distorting it. That's infantile.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other part of how infantile this discussion is is that he has also spoken very negatively about carbon capture and storage. Even the Democrats in the US—hardly a centre-right party, with Joe Biden at the head—and even John Kerry, who is the leader for their meeting a lot of their net zero targets, support nuclear. America supports carbon capture and storage, but not our genius minister. He rules it all out. This Labor government have the most ambitious targets for renewables for the timeline they have as part of the energy grid. Yes, we are committed to net zero 2050, but at the same time we believe it's essential for the lights to stay on. We need to look at all of these technologies. You can't go into something as important as your energy supplier and say, 'I'm going to rule out and not consider a whole lot of different technologies.' This government has done that with ones that other countries are saying are crucial to it—that is, carbon capture and storage, and nuclear, among others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The record of the minister is reckless, with previous ministries he's had in previous governments and when in opposition. That's why we're not going to support these bills. They're a layer of bureaucracy which is going to make things more difficult, and they're also going to basically direct where money needs to go. If we had a vacuum here, you could maybe understand the new agency or statutory body, but we already have an executive agency within the department. We have ARENA and we have the CEFC—we have two net transition authorities looking at trying to get us to net zero. They're standalone agencies anyway. But the Labor government are always looking to make things more difficult and more costly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing I really want to say about this is the Prime Minister said, 'The buck will stop with us,' and 'We will be a new, transparent government,' and the lights were going to shine in. The other thing that's very disappointing, too, is I have never heard—and with all due respect I will say that many ministers on the other side do get up and really come up and meet the policy discussions when we disagree with them, and I respect that. The Minister for Climate Change and Energy never gets up seriously and says: 'Do you know what? This is what's going on and this is what we're doing.' He always gets up and thinks he's the funnyman. He's always having a go about policies in an ideological sense. He never comes up and says, 'I'm going to address these issues and address why we're ruling out this, this and this.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, energy is a really important issue for us as a country. Obviously, net zero is an important thing. What we do and how we get there are going to be very important. I'm a naturally optimistic person, but, in my role as shadow trade and tourism minister, I'm not speaking to anyone across this country who is. That's in any stakeholder group across any industry body, whether they be farmers, miners, retailers or even in tourism. I had a meeting with a stakeholder in an industry tourism group. They were saying that the biggest thing they're finding with this new government is just that there's more red and green tape. They're finding it exceptionally difficult to do anything.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, that doesn't resonate over on that side of politics, because they're so overrepresented by the union movement. There wouldn't be a handful of people over on that side of politics who have woken up every day and gone, 'I've got to go into my business today to generate enough income—to have enough customers and enough cash flow—not only to pay my salary but the salaries of the people I'm employing.' That means you have a really different mindset and a really different outlook. It's about how streamlined you have to be—how cheaply you can do things in the sense of getting things to market or to your customers as quickly as you can. That side of politics has never got that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In history, there have probably been a few that have had a bit of an idea. I think that when Paul Keating was Treasurer he did some things which showed he understood how the economy works and tried to make ours a more productive economy. That's probably why he was in the Labor government with the longest term ever. But that's unusual; it isn't how they're wired and it isn't within the DNA of the Labor Party—and it's certainly not in the DNA of the Greens. Interestingly, I sat here before the Leader of the Greens spoke. Hearing him scares me! I certainly hope that this government is never in minority government with them. I know that they do deals now in the Senate which are to the detriment of our country, but they would lurch to the left and the lights would go out in that case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, it isn't in their DNA. Their starting point on anything is: 'Let's set up a new bureaucratic process. Let's set up'—in this case—'a new entity. Let's put more people into that entity. Let's have more people involved in the decision-making of this entity. Let's make everything more difficult. Let's make everything go around in more and more circles.' That's why we aren't supporting this legislation. Again, through the directive within the legislation, they're already ruling out a lot of the solutions that will take us to net zero anyway.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've seen other bills which are coming forward to this chamber and I worry about the future of our country, the prosperity of our country and job growth in our country. With these particular bills and the way in which the minister is looking at this, I worry, literally, about the lights staying on in this country. It's about this minister and the legislation he's bringing forward here with other bills. That's why the coalition will vote against this. We understand that to get to net zero by 2050 we have to work with business and with every technology that's available—and that we should do that in a way that's as streamlined as we can. The last thing we need to do is make another entity that's going to make things more bureaucratic and is ideologically opposed to solutions that will make this work.</span>

                    <a href="260805" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HASTIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:44</span>):  I rise today to speak on the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024 and the Net Zero Economy Authority (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024. Straight up, the coalition will not be supporting these bills. Why? This is yet another attempt by the Albanese government to push their radical green agenda by transforming the Net Zero Economy Agency from being a division within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to being a statutory agency. In the latest budget, the government doubled funding for this agency to a staggering $1.1 billion over the medium term. This on top of the billions of dollars already being moved into the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the newly branded Future Made in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why should we support this when the government has failed to provide a clear explanation on how the additional funding will be used? This is nothing but a bureaucratic waste, duplicating the responsibilities of existing state and federal departments. How many federal agencies tasked with renewable funding does this government actually need? This government seems obsessed with top-down, Canberra-centric approaches that ignore the needs and priorities of rural and regional Australia. We saw this during the Voice to Parliament debate, and we're seeing it again now. The last thing Australians need is to expand the powers and responsibilities of the Albanese government so they can further their net zero and climate agenda. Labor should be focusing instead on the real issues facing Australians: high inflation, increasing costs of living and excessive red tape. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to this, we have a new fuel efficiency standard, which is really just a big new tax on SUVs and utes for Australians. If you're an Australian and you have a large family, if you're a tradie or a farmer, if you tow a boat or a caravan, you will now pay more for new SUVs and utes. If you drive a Ford Ranger, a Toyota HiLux or Prado, a Mitsubishi Outlander, an Isuzu D-MAX or MU-X—the list could go on—all those new cars will become more expensive under the Albanese government, because what they have done, through the back door of the fuel efficiency standard, is impose a new tax on Australian consumers, particularly in the regions, where these vehicles are actually the workhorses of our local economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to that, we're also seeing this obsession with renewables continue in Western Australia, with a proposal for an offshore wind farm on the south-west coast of Western Australia. Of course, this will have all sorts of impacts, starting with the visual damage it will do to our beautiful horizon. Locals can appreciate that already. There will be damage to the ocean floor. There will be damage to our marine life. There will be damage to birds. All of this, of course, is before we even talk about the economic and financial cost of this wind farm. It'll cost a lot of money. There's a reason why these clean energy businesses are always asking for government handouts, and it's that they're not profitable. That's why Labor are subsidising this. That's why they're putting it on us. They're ignoring the concerns of our local community. The City of Mandurah has opposed it, and just last week the Labor member for Dawesville, my state member, who represents the Halls Head area, which will have views of the wind farm—she has come out and opposed it as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are just two examples of Labor's net zero obsession and how it's going to impact regular Australians—a new tax on SUVs and utes, and a massive big, ugly wind farm, producing unreliable, unaffordable energy for Western Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Cowan knows full well what this is going to do for your trips to the Margaret River. You won't be able to see that beautiful horizon when you leave Perth. You'll be instead looking at countless Eiffel towers on the horizon. Birds, marine life and ocean floors will be damaged, because of the Albanese government. You should focus on the concerns of regular Australians. You should focus on addressing the fundamental realities facing most Australian businesses and families. This Net Zero Economy Authority is not a priority for the families and businesses in my electorate of Canning. Their priority is ensuring that they can afford food, bills, petrol and keeping a roof over their heads.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To my constituents: I assure you that all of us on this side of the chamber are focused on making your life better, the cost of living more affordable and getting inflation down. We're not interested in bureaucracy and wasting time for no other purpose than to expand the reach of the bureaucracy here in Canberra.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:49</span>):  I join the member for Canning in raising some serious concerns, not just for the west of this nation but also for Queensland and Far North Queensland. I am happy to speak on the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024 and the Net Zero Economy Authority (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing that is of great concern to me, and will be to many people around the country, is when these bills talk about what happens with all of the workers that have kept the lights on, our coal workers. The bills talk about just moving them somewhere else: 'We'll transition them out of the industry they've worked in maybe their whole lives and put them somewhere different.' I don't think that's good at all, because in a place like Townsville, where I live, where Bravus has a coalmine and the majority of the workforce gets flown in and out to service that mine, when I speak to these coal workers, they love working there. They want to work there. They know one of our largest exports is coal, and they know they're doing good. They keep the lights on in this country and others around the world. Most importantly, they have stability in their job. They can provide for their families, they get good rosters and they get looked after. I think these bills are scary to many people who work in these industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Canning raised the ute tax, which is another scary tax that is going to be imposed on people around Australia: those  who drive utes or the family car or want to get away in a caravan. We heard before someone yell out, 'It'll be cheaper at the bowser but more expensive at the dealership.' I think it'll be more expensive at the dealership, and that will outweigh any sorts of savings spruiked by the government. We've seen other nations who had taken this up walk back how far they had gone with it. I've heard small businesses in the electorate of Herbert, in Townsville, say this will crush their business. This will kill small business, and I don't think that's good.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The energy industry jobs plan would allow the authority to utilise the industrial relations system to manage the redeployment of workers in closing coal-fired and gas-fired power stations and their dependent employees, coalminers that are reliant on a closing power station. This is scary language that talks about people that work in these industries, that work in gas and coal, being told this is now not important: 'We're closing this down, and we're going to move you somewhere else. We won't tell you if you'll be moved into a place where you want to go, or we won't tell you if your renumeration is going to be equal or less.' I don't think giving the responsibility of someone's livelihood to a bureaucrat in Canberra is a good idea. We love self-determination. We want people to work in industries they choose, we want them to have a career in what they want and we want them to live in this country anywhere they want.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think this is a massive overreach. These are essentially IR bills disguised as bills for the regions and for transition, which we will oppose. We will oppose it because we believe it's bureaucratic waste and duplication; it's a top-down, Canberra-centric approach which will fail to deliver on the unique needs of the regions. New obligations on small, medium and large businesses—the fact is that this is another example of Labor's haphazard approach on industry policy, which delivers no guarantees for local workers. This is very much a Canberra thought bubble policy that will absolutely hurt the regions. Regional Australia, in places like Townsville, is where we have the workers this will affect. I haven't seen any of the ministers or the energy minister in Townsville talking to the workforce this is going to affect. I haven't seen the minister holding a community town hall—not handpicked people; open it up for the community and allow them to come in and voice their concerns. That's what I would expect from bills and a policy that'll affect regional Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of the significant flaws in these pieces of legislation, as we found out, the government has doubled the authority's budget to nearly $400 million from 2023-24 to 2026-27 alone, with further funding to a total of $1.1 billion over the medium term. The federal government cannot afford to waste over a billion dollars on Canberra bureaucrats across the Net Zero Authority, the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations and the Fair Work Commission when it is unable to detail the actions this authority will perform that are not already being done. The component of the Net Zero Economy Authority that relates to the new investment in the net zero transition is a bureaucratic waste which largely mirrors the responsibilities of existing federal and state agencies. We're putting your money, taxpayer money—it's good to see the member for Lilley here at the table—into an agency that is mirrored by other federal and state agencies. That seems like wasteful spending.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The authority explicitly has responsibility for facilitating public and private sector participation and investment in greenhouse gas emissions reduction and net zero transformation initiatives in Australia, including in new industries. This is almost copy and paste from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation role 'to facilitate increased flows of finance into the clean industry sector and to facilitate the achievement of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets'. Similarly, the role of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency is 'to improve the competitiveness of renewable energy technologies, to increase the supply of renewable energy in Australia, and to facilitate the achievement of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions targets'. The level of duplication in the proposed Net Zero Economy Authority's responsibility to promote new investment in the net zero transition in existing Commonwealth entities is beyond a joke. How many federal agencies tasked with renewable energy financing does the Commonwealth require? This approach, focused on facilitating investment consistent with net zero ambitions, also links into the government's preference for picking winners, rather than genuine investment facilitation and jobs creation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another thing that's concerning is the way it talks about transitioning the workforce into other employment. It talks about coal workers and people who work in the gas industry. What about the small, mum-and-dad business that runs the cleaning on the mine site? That's not mentioned in here. What happens to that business? A small business takes a risk, invests, works hard, gets a good contract and a stable workforce, and then these bills appear—out of Canberra, not out of the regions. They didn't consult with you. Where is the small business to go? What's supposed to happen to them? There are lots of question marks in the cloud over these bills. It's on the minister to answer, and we haven't seen that yet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also likely that, once the authority is established, the federal government will continue to add powers and responsibilities to the authority to support its net zero and climate ambitions. Will the government rule out giving the Net Zero Economy Authority new powers to streamline and/or expedite regulatory approvals or finance for transformational green energy projects? Following the tabling of Labor's 2024-25 budget, the funding for the authority and its related activities is budgeted to be $399.1 million from 2023-24 to 2026-27 alone, with further funding, to a total of $1.1 billion, over the medium term. That is on top of the billions of dollars in additional funding being moved into the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the newly badged Future Made in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This $13 billion in taxpayer funded subsidies for big business does not address the source of Labor's cost-of-living crisis. Labor's focus should be on dealing with energy costs, high inflation and out-of-control red tape. Instead, Labor continually fails to address the fundamental realities facing most Australian businesses. With insolvencies at record highs and more businesses going offshore, supporting a small number of big businesses is irresponsible and a slap in the face for all businesses desperately seeking answers from this government in order to survive. The level of duplication between the net zero authority and existing Commonwealth institutions demonstrates a complete waste of over $1 billion of federal government funds over the forward estimates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed energy industry jobs plan is a long-held union wish list item. It was an election commitment carried under Bill Shorten and dubbed the 'Just Transition Authority' and has been adopted in some form in all ALP national platforms since 2018. Australia's current industrial framework features a well-established safety net that applies and has applied for a considerable amount of time to instances of business closures and industry change, especially relating to the closure of coal-fired power stations. Under section 2.10.1 of the AEMC's national electricity rules, coal-fired power stations must provide 3½ years notice before being able to close. Furthermore, a national agency to assist regions is also duplicative of state based mechanisms designed to achieve the same outcome. For example, regional planning initiatives already exist throughout the New South Wales government's Hunter Regional Plan and the Victorian government's Latrobe Valley Authority transitional plan. This new authority would also cut across the work and vision of existing Regional Development Australia committees, which recognise that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to creating a vibrant region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills add an additional layer of regulation not previously considered by the Fair Work system. These bills do not even require the relevant employee's consent for their information to be passed on from their employer onto the Net Zero Economy Authority and the legally mandated trade union representation on its board. These bills are not for the regions, nor are they bills to support the net zero transition. These are industrial relations bills that the Labor government are gifting to the union movement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition will oppose the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024 and the Net Zero Economy Authority (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024 because it's bureaucratic waste and duplication—a top-down, Canberra-centric approach which is set to fail on delivering on the unique needs of the regions. There are new obligations on small, medium and large businesses, and the fact is that this is another example of Labor's haphazard approach on industry policy which delivers no guarantee for local workers. The coalition does not support these bills, and I would encourage ministers to come out to the regions. Come out to the people who will be affected by this. Sit down with them. Have a town hall meeting. Go to a coalmine. Go to a coal-fired power station. Sit down with the workers and talk through this, because it's clear that that hasn't happened. No-one has come to Townsville. No-one has sat down with the Bravus employees and said, 'This is what the plan is for your future.' They're going to be reading about it tomorrow. They're going to be seeing it tonight. I think it is a shame for a government that ran on transparency not to be transparent with the people that they are going to, effectively, ruin the livelihoods of.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look at the small business, the mum-and-dad business that could be running the cleaning operation on the site, you wonder what happens to them. They're not mentioned once in these bills. Those opposite don't talk about where that business will get transitioned to. Do they just lose and have to walk off with no support from this government? I think that's a disgrace, and that's why the coalition won't be supporting these bills.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WOLAHAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  Throughout the last century, one of the great debates that was linked to bloody conflict was around the role of government. It's one of the great debates because it affects people's lives—which path you take: whether you want more government or you want less government. When we look at the great movements in the last century for dragging people out of poverty, for lifting prosperity, all of the other advances in human technology, all of the metrics that make life worth living, we see that most have been not because of government but in the absence of government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You can view power in one of two ways. You can view the success of the nation through the success of the government, and it is the size and the power and the resources of the government that can drive you. That's one view. Another view is that your measure of success is the absence of government. It is the small business, the family and the private sector, and their success is our success, driven by their ingenuity and their ability to solve problems, to put capital where it needs to be put and to incentivise labour in the way that it should be incentivised. These aren't just abstract theories that we talk about at political conferences or in the classroom. They are central to the great movement of taking people from poverty into prosperity. It is at the heart of this nation being where it is today. It is at the absolute heart.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So when we come to this place, whether we are Liberal or Labor, it is important to ask these questions: Do you want to democratise power or centralise it? Do you want to democratise prosperity or centralise it? They're important questions because it is in our DNA and our human nature to want to centralise things. You don't have to be a particular leader with an ego. That's just what power does. It coalesces around other power. That's what prosperity does. It must be resisted, and it must be resisted for very important reasons, because we need to resist it now more than ever. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Intergenerational </span><span style="font-style:italic;">report</span> notes that Commonwealth government spending per person in 2023 was $25,000. Accounting for inflation, using that 2023 dollar mark, that report has that number going to $40,000 per person. That is a weight that the nation cannot bear, particularly if, in the absence of productivity growth, the median wage is going to be about $65,000 and the average wage is $95,000. It's unsustainable. What we haven't seen from this government are the productivity gains to offset that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024 and the Net Zero Economy Authority (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024, we are seeing the creation of an agency, the Net Zero Economy Authority, that will have several functions that will concentrate power, concentrate bureaucracy and not address the substance of the issue that there is bipartisan support for. This authority will coordinate net zero policy and planning across government. It will facilitate both government and private participation and investment and support affected workers, including First Nations Australians, to participate in the transition. It also has a role to deliver educational and promotional initiatives. With many bills that come before this place, if you just open up the objectives, they are usually drafted in such a way that reasonable people can agree with those objectives. But the devil is always in the detail—the unintended or the intended consequences that will flow from that and will have a significant impact on people's lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two broad aspects to this legislation about these powers. The first head of power is that it will facilitate new investment in the net zero transition. It will operate as a shopfront, for want of a better word. It will seek to work with project advocates and state governments to get renewable projects to investment decision. Again, it's a government-knows-best view, and we've seen where that goes. We've seen how that movie plays out. Like many families in Australia, I was quite glad to get the NBN and use it. But no-one has to be a technology or communications engineer to know that that technology will quickly fade, and we're seeing that. The government didn't have anything to do with Starlink and Elon Musk, but that's already an alternative to that monumentally expensive project. But here we are. There is a great risk in centralising this one-stop shopfront that knows best. We are going into an area that is about not just other technologies but technologies that are linked to the most fundamental input into business after capital and labour, being energy. They're the three big inputs for anyone running a business: capital, labour and energy. This authority covers all three, and not necessarily for good. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second responsibility of the authority is in assisting the impacted workers in the transition through the Energy Industry Jobs Plan. When there's change, there are those who are left behind. That happens. That happens all the time. It is important that—whether it is through training, other opportunities or just the initiative of the individuals involved—there are other opportunities out there for them. When we transitioned from a horse and cart transport sector to the combustion engine, that happened without the government working out what to do. The big oil companies put petrol stations up. They did that without much help from the government because they saw an opportunity, they saw a need and they reacted. That's how the process works; it's how it's supposed to work. For some reason, we are reinventing all of those lessons over many decades. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where did this come from? Where did this newfound love of government knowing best come from? It's an old idea and a dangerous idea, but it's one that the Treasurer quite clearly articulated in his previous summer's essay where he put a kite up to show that whilst he might admire Paul Keating he doesn't, in his actions, follow his commitment to the non-government sector driving prosperity forward. In fact the essay sought to reinvent capitalism. That is quite disturbing and will have consequences, because the Treasurer is seeking to reinvent capitalism. Again, point to an example in history or around the world where many, many other leaders and political parties—whether they were democratic or otherwise, and they're usually not democratic—have sought to reinvent capitalism. How did that turn out? How has it gone for those countries? How has it gone when government seeks to pick winners? Again, when government knows best.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What special skill and expertise is in this building that knows better than Australians out there who are taking the risks, who are putting their own capital forward and putting their own house on the line? Why do we think that we know better? It is hubris, it is absolute arrogance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue with these bills is they are a wolf in sheep's clothing. There are industrial relations impacts contained within these bills that have not been properly spoken about. They haven't been frank with the public and they haven't been frank with those who either run a small or medium business, or who aspire to, about the extra burden and layer that's about to be put on them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will oppose these bills for several reasons. Fundamentally, they are a philosophical difference and objection to the role of government that we believe in democratising power. That's an admirable thing because it means are we in this place for ourselves or for the nation. It's about democratising prosperity, and there's humility to that. Do we know better or do we trust Australian ingenuity, Australian risk-takers and Australians who work hard to know better, particularly those in the regions. And because these bills disproportionately affect regional businesses, I do listen to my Nationals colleagues and my regional Liberal colleagues. I don't represent a regional seat, but that's the point. Because I don't represent a regional seat, who am I to tell my good friends in the Nationals and my good friends in regional Liberal areas what they should be doing?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And it goes both ways. I wouldn't ask them to tell a metropolitan member what we should do in Melbourne, even though some do. That's the purpose of this place. There are 151 seats, each little bit of Australia broken up and represented. Through their voices, we get to the better decisions. So, when the regional and rural members, through our friends in the Nationals and our party, are telling us that this is going to hit the regions particularly hard, we should listen. I listen. The government benches should listen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is another example of Labor's haphazard approach to industrial policy. There's only so much that Australian businesses can take. Every corner of this country is doing it tough, but there are some that are doing it tougher than others. In my state of Victoria, small and medium businesses are doing it particularly tough. There is a churn to businesses. Some will go; some won't survive. That happens. It's part of the process. But there has consistently been, more often than not, an aggregate increase. What we know is that, last financial year, the only state not to have an aggregate increase was Victoria. In an aggregate sense, 7,600 businesses left our state. Again, my good friend the member for Herbert is from Queensland, which had an increase of 11,000 businesses. I have heard many Queensland members tell me about the Victorians that have moved north to set up business there. So, if you want to have a good look at what the future looks like with a Labor dominated government, go to the history of a Labor dominated state government. That's your looking glass into the future. To those small-business owners and those medium-business owners, I say: you need help, not further burdens from bills like these.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are those who will look at the title of this and make the usual calls about who is standing strong on climate change or not. That is a dishonest view of this. It's a straw man argument. Australians want us to solve the problems that matter to them in a serious way. Engaging in those sorts of straw man arguments—and we've seen them particularly from the Greens political party—is not in the interests of our economy and our society. This transition is happening. It is a difficult one that's happening around the world. There's bipartisan support for it. But we have to ask ourselves: What has changed from all of the lessons, particularly in the last century, where we have learned that the top-down government-knows-best approach isn't going to solve it? What has changed that we think we can flip the script on that?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I enjoyed the Treasurer's essay, but the answer isn't there. I enjoyed his reading his PhD on Paul Keating, and the answer certainly wasn't there. So we ask the government: Why do you think you can reinvent capitalism? Why do you think that you know best over Australians? Why do you think we should not, wherever we can, democratise power, democratise prosperity and, in doing so, put the interests of Australians before ourselves? Because that is needed more than ever.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:18</span>):  I rise today to speak on the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024 and the Net Zero Economy Authority (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024. I look at this through the lens of: what will these bills do for my electorate of Dawson? The answer is net zero. These bills are turning the Net Zero Economy Agency into a standalone statutory authority. By doing so, the Albanese Labor government are wasting $1.1 billion. They are wasting $1.1 billion of taxpayers' money on duplicating something that already exists. This comes hot on the heels of the recent budget, with 36,000 more bureaucrats to be employed at a cost of over $24 billion over the forward estimates. Unbelievable. How much more do you think the taxpayers of Australia can pay? There are already federal and state entities who exist and largely mirror the responsibilities of what would become the Net Zero Economy Authority, and—classic Labor—these bills have net zero details of how they plan to deal with how the overlapping organisations will or should work together. This is all about the reckless race-to-renewables fantasy of those opposite. It's about fast-tracking the swindle factories—you know, the big whoosh-whoosh fans that wipe out heaps of birds, bang, when the birds hit the blades. Of course fast-tracking the solar projects as well—</span>

                    </a>  They go as far as the eye can see—again, enormous environmental damage, wiping out g-qual, good quality agricultural land that provides the food and fibre for the whole nation. They feed the nation out of the good quality agricultural land, but no, we decide to put solar panels there. What about the native vegetation? The native vegetation is being wiped out. Whole hilltops, straight across, are being wiped out to put swindle factories up in the top area of those.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Where are the Greens on this? Their silence is absolutely deafening. I thought they were keen to look after the environment, but no. If this were a coalmine or a grazier who was trying to knock a tree down so he could have some grass to feed his stock, he'd be in jail. No, because it's this reckless race-to-renewables, that's okay. Do whatever you like. You get a free pass. As everyone knows here, I'm a farmer by trade, so I want to talk about a little thing called photosynthesis. What happens with photosynthesis is it takes the carbon dioxide out of the air, through the process of photosynthesis, and turns it into oxygen. What do those opposite want to do? Fill all of the paddocks full of steel—which, by the way, has to be made by mining as well, but everyone seems to forget about that. I just don't get it. Again, the Greens, through all of this process, are absolutely silent. This is all just to create intermittent, unreliable power, and that's exactly what it is. It doesn't work all the time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To illustrate this I'll tell a little story which best sums up the 'intermittent and unreliable'. Four blokes go into a bar, and they order four schooners. The barman comes over: 'What do you want, fellas?' 'Four schooners.' 'Sorry, mate. No beer today, because the sun's not shining and the wind's not blowing.' This is the analogy. This is the direct comparison. These four blokes go home, tails between their legs, thinking about Slim Dusty's pub with no beer, but not to be outdone, they front up again the next day. 'We're going to the pub, boys. You beauty.' They go and see the barman: 'Four schooners, please. You've got beer today?' 'We've got beer today.' Beauty. He brings the first two schooners over, disappears and comes back: 'We need another two.' 'Sorry, mate. The wind's not blowing. You can only have two schooners.' What do we do about that? I know in the electricity world we have to load-shed. We have to share. We have blackouts; we have brownouts. That's exactly what happens. Not to be outdone, day 3 comes along and the four blokes are still keen. They want to have a round together. They want to have four beers. They come in: 'Four schooners, please. We've got beer, don't we?' 'We've got beer today.' They pour the first two straight across, and they get another one. The fourth bloke is waiting for his beer. Where is it? 'Sorry, mate. A cloud has gone over. We can't provide you with a beer.' That is a direct analogy of exactly what happens when you've got an intermittent and unreliable electricity supply. It beggars belief. What if you went to the bakery and they only sold you bread when it suited them? It should be beholden on whatever the energy creator is to be able to provide power 24/7. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is intermittent and unreliable as well, so this doesn't surprise me at all. What has the Albanese Labor government done to help the Labor created cost-of-living crisis? Net zero. What have they done to alleviate the pressures of the housing crisis? You guessed it: net zero. What have they done to curb inflation? Net zero. What have they done to stop interest rates rising? Net zero. What have they done to bring down the rising cost of energy? Net zero. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So let's explore the capex of this. We hear from Minister Bowen about how renewables are the cheapest form of energy. Well, let's look at the cheapest form of energy. When you look at a solar panel, you only look at what it produces in the middle of the day, not how much it produces overnight or when clouds go over. Say you buy the solar panels. At best, they only last 20 years. Some of them last 15 to 20 years. So what are you going to do with the solar panels? You'll have to store them somewhere or put them in landfill because you can't recycle them. That cost of landfill, with all the leachate and all the monitoring, is therefore ever. And then you've got to do it again. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the capex. Because solar panels only work seven or eight hours a day at the most and we need power 24/7, they have to be supplemented with something. So here comes wind. You've already have paid for your solar panels and then you've got to put a wind tower up. Let's also overlook the cost at the end of the life of the wind tower. It costs $600,000 to dismantle a wind tower. That's the cost at the end, but you've got to buy them upfront. Again, the wind tower only works when the wind's blowing. It doesn't work when there's not much wind, and it doesn't work when there's too much wind. So that capex is expended.</span>

So you pay for all the dams, and all this stuff also has to be connected by a transmission network. Those opposite are saying, 'Okay. We need 28,000 kilometres of poles and wires to get all this connected up.' I'll go back to the hydro. We've got the hydro, which can't provide it all the time either. Then I hear about batteries, but batteries just do not last long enough. Renewables are not baseload; you need baseload power.</span>

They're too frightened to use more gas, but that is good for baseload as well. But if you really want net emission technologies, you need to go nuclear. Nuclear will provide next to no emissions technologies and will provide power 24/7, not like those opposite, who only want to provide power when it suits them. </span>

You have zero chance—net zero chance—of having manufacturing in this country unless you have reliable and affordable power. That comes back to your capex as well. When someone invests in manufacturing, they want their factory to be able to operate 24/7. That's how you get your return on your capital.

What have the Labor government done to create a solar plan to move Australia forward? Net zero. What have they done to strengthen our economy? Net zero. What have they done to increase productivity? Net zero. What have they done to support our farmers, our fishers, our miners and all our primary industries? Absolutely net zero.</span>

This is taxing the very vehicles that all the people around my electorate drive. They have to. This is a bid to get them to drive electric vehicles. But newsflash for those opposite: the electric vehicles can't carry the weight, can't tow the load and can't cover the vast distances that are required. They're not suited for our purposes. If you want to use them in the city, happy days, but why tax my people out of existence to create this ideological fantasy land?</span>

What this legislation does is give the unions a big stick to threaten employers to provide paid time off to facilitate activities to drive union membership—oh, we love that, because we clip the ticket on the way through for that, don't we, folks?—and enforce obligations that businesses may not be able to afford. The union movement wants the Net Zero Economy Authority to be legislated because the authority will be able to collect the personal information of all employees, and those opposite do exactly what their union puppetmasters say.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LLEW O'BRIEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wide Bay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:33</span>):  I rise to speak in opposition to the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024 and the Net Zero Economy Authority (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024, because this is just more of the same from the Albanese government. This is another cog in the machine that is their environmental policy, which will see this nation burdened with debt and dysfunction for generations to come. I certainly will not stand by and quietly let that happen. So speaking against these bills is important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bills supposedly are to create yet another department, which seems to be something that the Albanese government is excelling at—that is, creating bureaucracy. I know, when it comes to renewable energy, the Prime Minister loves to come in here and talk about us being a renewable energy superpower. At this rate, the only superpower we're going to be is a bureaucratic one. With the proposed 36,000 public servants, at the cost of $24 billion over the forward estimates, we are becoming a bureaucratic paradise under this Labor government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills move the current agency that operates under the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet out into its own independent authority, and it's given a number of responsibilities to facilitate both government and private participation and investment, to support effective workers, to support First Nations Australians to participate in the transition and to deliver educational and promotional initiatives as Australia transitions to a net zero emissions economy. It all sounds very lovely, but, as is the case with Labor, the serving suggestion label should not be taken as what it is, because it looks very different to that in operation. When the cake is made, it looks and tastes very different.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills will facilitate projects that are already having a very negative impact on my local area. The Forest Wind project that is proposed for the coast is one of the biggest wind turbine electricity generation projects, with hundreds and hundreds of these giant wind turbines, and there's been virtually no consultation with the people living around the project. This has been thrust upon them. What a cracker the Borumba Dam pumped hydro project is—$14 billion proposed for a pumped hydro scheme that will produce two gigawatts for 24 hours! No wonder the Queensland Labor government is refusing to give over the business case and the detail on this project, because blind Freddy can see that that is a project that will not stack up. It's been thrown out there based on ideology and politics, not on the economy and science. This is what we are experiencing throughout Australia with these mad projects. This is the main focus of this government. When we're in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis that has been acknowledged by the Reserve Bank governor as being somewhat homegrown now, they want to concentrate on this ideological madness where they're killing off industries instead of growing them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Look at the comparison between that and the approach of the coalition. We have already announced that our plan is not to pick industries that will die under our administration. It is to support all industries that will potentially flourish and produce employment and revenue to provide the services that we rely on. We will streamline approvals for projects like gas projects, which will be required as we move forward. We will streamline those projects, and so those projects will come online quicker and there will be more jobs in those industries for Australians. There will be more jobs for workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll also look at some of the barriers that are stopping Australians from having those jobs, like the Environmental Defenders Office. We will defund them, because all they're doing, and all this government is doing in supporting them and funding them, is killing Australian jobs for workers. It defies belief that the Australian Labor Party has got to the point where, due to its left-wing ideology, it is now saying to tried and proven industries with blue-collar workers: 'Your industry? No, we don't like it anymore. We're going to kill it.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills are not a shopfront for industry; they are palliative care. They are an industry hospice. Let me tell you about these jobs and these industries. You go in there. They'll give you a bit of support. But guess what? You are not going home, and there are no jobs at the end of this. There is the suggestion that green hydrogen is going to save the country. The numbers around that are just mind-bogglingly ridiculous. Eight hundred gigawatts of energy are required for this proposition. If you believe that, I've got a really good deal on a bridge! It looks like a coathanger, and I'll give it to you for a really good price! That's how mad these things are. These proposals say, 'We're going to transition you out of being a well-paid miner into manufacturing solar panels.' That's the alternative that's being suggested here, and these bills facilitate all of this. Talk about taking proud Australian workers and almost ridiculing them with this sort of stuff! What has happened to the Australian Labor Party?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once upon a time, the unions looked after their workers. They have a proud history of this. I remember going on a driving holiday with my kids years ago and stopping in Barcaldine at the Tree of Knowledge. I remember showing the kids the Tree of Knowledge and telling them about the shearers' strike of 1891 and explaining to them the importance of these things throughout Australian history. But, if I were taking that same trip now, I'd be saying: 'Now you can't recognise that party for what it was when that manifesto was read under that tree in the 1890s. It's now some sort of left-wing ideological servant of the United Nations that kills off jobs. It doesn't support fair conditions for workers. It actually puts them into unemployment.' My goodness me! What has happened to the Australian Labor Party?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, people out there are currently in a cost-of-living crisis. There has been an 11 per cent increase in the price of food. Housing has gone up by 14 per cent, rents by 30 per cent, electricity by 20 per cent, gas by 25 per cent and health by 11 per cent. And we're talking about killing off industries and killing off revenues and pumping government money into the economy with a bureaucracy that is only going to inflate these problems? There is no sign, of course, of the $275 reduction promised at the last election by the Prime Minister, who stood before the Australian population many, many times at many venues and promised that, under him, there would be this $275 reduction in your power bill. That certainly turned out to be an absolute and utter falsehood.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You've got to ask yourself, when you look at these bills and you take into consideration those numbers of 36,000 more public servants and the $24 billion: is this going to save us somewhere? Is this going to perform a function that's going to improve the country? When you look at the detail, the answer is no, because these positions that are being created are basically duplicating positions that already exist. Even if you support the intention of the government in creating this department, surely you can't support the fact that it will be doing a job that other state and federal departments are currently doing. It makes no sense, it's economically irresponsible and, at what is now forecast to be a billion dollars for this department, it defies belief.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion I will say that, aside from the obvious problems with these bills—the duplication; the fact they're masquerading as industrial relations bills when they're designed to give the unions more power—you have to ask yourself: what are they ultimately going to do? What is this government department going to do? I can tell you what it's not going to do, and that's change the temperature of the world. This government department will have no influence whatsoever on the temperature of the world. Look at our international trading partners, particularly China. Our emissions for 2023 were a bit over 400 million tonnes, which is only about 75 per cent of China's increase for that year. If you take our emissions right out, China, with its increase, will have increased global emissions without us. You think to yourself: China has agreed that its carbon emissions will peak by 2030 and that it will be net zero by 2060, but some people are anticipating that it has 300 gigawatts of coal-fired power currently under construction and planned. Bear in mind that our energy system in Australia is about 70 gigawatts. They've got 300 gigawatts of coal-fired power planned or under construction. Are these bills going to make any difference whatsoever? Is China going to achieve these goals that it's signed up to? It's obvious that it won't.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Based on ideology and politics, we're going to trade in our First World economy for an unreliable, intermittent energy source that ultimately is going to be very expensive, before it collapses. These are atrocious bills that have been put forward by an atrocious government.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PIKE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:48</span>):  Can I start this afternoon by congratulating the previous two speakers on such great contributions to the debate on the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024 and the Net Zero Economy Authority (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024. The two members represent parts of regional Queensland that are going to be impacted by the government's plans to achieve net zero and meet its ambitious targets over the next few years, and these members understand what the impact of these bills will be on their communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I represent a section of bayside Brisbane that some people wouldn't think of as a natural place to have a lot of people working in fossil fuels within the energy system, but in fact Brisbane is often talked about as being our biggest mining town. There are a lot of people in my electorate who work for companies that undertake these kinds of operations and who will be affected by what the government has planned. I will use an example from my electorate that I think illustrates where the government is trying to go here. It's a cautionary tale, perhaps, that those opposite might be able to look at in thinking about where we don't want to go and how we ensure our money is spent wisely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate I've got North Stradbroke Island, which is a great tourism mecca for people not just across South-East Queensland but across all of Australia. But on North Stradbroke Island there was a very strong, thriving sand-mining industry for many years, and it became a fashionable thing to talk down the sand-mining industry and to talk about its impact on the tourism product of the island. I disagreed. Many of the islanders who worked in the sand-mining industry disagreed as well. They liked the jobs that they had on the island. It didn't have a major impact on the tourism product there. People didn't even know it was happening. It was out of sight and out of mind, but it created a lot of jobs and it created a lot of wealth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current state Labor government decided to abolish sand mining on North Stradbroke Island, and the pitch to the locals was: 'Don't worry. We're going to invest $20 million in an economic transition strategy. You're not going to lose your high-paying job in sand mining. You're going to be forging a new career in a new industry. You're going to get a great job in the tourism sector or in ecotourism'—or whatever other industry the government dreamt up that would replace their high-paying mining job. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That economic transition strategy started in 2015. The $20 million has all been spent and, really, no-one can point to anything of tangible benefit out of it. There's a lot less employment on the islands, and the tourism industry has actually gone backwards over that period of time. A lot of the islanders just look at that and go, 'We were absolutely sold a pup.' All that money was wasted, and I fear that—as the government introduces these bills and seeks to make this legislation and brings through the details of these bills—we are heading in the same direction but on a much larger scale. This isn't just the microcosm of North Stradbroke Island. This is something that will impact a lot of communities across the length and breadth of Australia, and over a long period of time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition will be opposing these bills because they are costly and they put pressure across businesses—not just big businesses but small businesses as well. We consider them a union pushed IR reform masquerading as bills. They neglect our regions, of course, as I've mentioned, and they do not help local workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One aspect of the legislation that the government's speakers have highlighted earlier in this debate is that it's going to facilitate new investment in net-zero transition, but it does this by duplicating the work of existing agencies. The coalition just can't consider it to be money well spent to be duplicating the work that's already being undertaken by other agencies, at both the federal and the state level.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second responsibility is assisting the impacted workers in that transition area through the Energy Industry Jobs Plan. Here, the coalition is concerned that this is masquerading as a solution while really being union pushed IR bills. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's costly. Labor, of course, loves wasting money. We saw this with the Voice referendum, which cost us $450 million. I had a chat to our opposition spokesperson on government waste this morning and he outlined some of the great examples that he's compiling of how much this government is wasting, and this is certainly on that list. We saw record, inflationary spending in last month's budget. Now we see this with bureaucratic waste.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has doubled the authority's budget to nearly $400 million from 2023-24 through to 2026-27 alone, with further funding to cost $1.1 billion over the medium term. The government has failed to justify this spending. They've not detailed what actions the authority would perform that are not already happening. Existing state and federal agencies already do the work that the Net Zero Economy Authority promises to do. The work of existing agencies and mechanisms such as the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Major Projects Facilitation Agency will be duplicated under this new agency. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation's legislated role is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To facilitate increased flows of finance into the clean energy sector and to facilitate the achievement of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new Net Zero Economy Authority's role is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… to facilitate public and private sector participation and investment in greenhouse gas emissions reduction and net zero transformation initiatives in Australia—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">including in new industries. These are almost identical. As Australians struggle with the cost of living, we need a government that will rein in spending. Spending over a billion dollars to change the Net Zero Economy Agency to the Net Zero Economy Authority does not rein that in. It is simply bureaucratic waste and more duplication.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another factor as to why we are opposing these bills is that we're worried about the pressure this will place on business. There's concern about the scope of the legislation, particularly for smaller, dependent employers. The explanatory memorandum provides an example of a local cleaning service with a commercial relationship with a closing generator, classified as a dependent employer. It is not clear what liability or obligations the cleaning service would be expected to adopt under the Energy Industry Jobs Plan. It would be up to the FWC to determine. There are no carve-outs or exclusions for small businesses in this legislation. These small businesses are unlikely to have the resources or the capacity to administer the services that are going to be outlined in the bills. It's also unclear whether the plan will apply to any permanent employees of closing or dependent employers, and whether casual employees will also be captured.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The change claims to help workers in the regions who lose their jobs through the transition to renewables, but Australia already has a well-established safety net. Under section 2.10 of AEMC's National Electricity Rules, coal-fired power stations must provide 3½ years notice before being able to close. In many instances of business closure and industry change, especially relating to the closure of coal-fired power stations, our industrial frameworks have already been successful. The bills add an additional layer of regulation not previously considered by the Fair Work system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's focus should be dealing with energy costs, high inflation and out-of-control red tape; instead, what these bills do, and what we are seeing, unfortunately, too much from this Labor government, is continual failure to address the fundamental realities that are facing Australian businesses. We are seeing insolvencies at record highs and more businesses going offshore. Supporting a small number of big businesses is irresponsible and a slap in the face for small businesses desperately seeking answers from this government to survive, particularly when staring down the barrel of what this transition will mean for them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Energy Industry Jobs Plan is disguised to help regions but is really just something that Labor's union friends have been pushing for a while now. The Energy Industry Jobs Plan is bought and paid for by the union movement. The unions want the Net Zero Economy Authority to be legislated because the authority will be able to collect the personal information of employees of coal-fired power stations, from financial records to phone numbers. Indeed, the bills do not even require the relevant employees' consent for the information to be passed from their employer on to the Net Zero Economy Authority and the legally mandated trade union representative on its board. This is a gross violation of privacy that Labor's union friends have crafted into this legislation, and I think most Australian workers would be shocked if they read the details of that and understood the implications.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bills also don't do enough to care for our regions. We saw this in my electorate where Labor ignored the unique needs of my Bay Islands and denied them eligibility for our Growing Regions Program funds. But my seat is only slightly regional; the impacts on some of the bigger regions are going to be significantly worse. The bills claim to protect regional jobs, but with a lack of detail that delivers no guarantees for local workers and adds pressure to businesses without any guarantee of the types of employment that workers may transition into. The constituents of mine on North Stradbroke Island were promised that they were going to be given much better-paid jobs, greater tenure moving forward and nothing to worry about regarding the closure of their industry. Well, today they look back and think about the golden times that they enjoyed when that industry was thriving on the islands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, a national agency to assist regions is also duplicative of state based mechanisms designed to achieve the same outcome. For example, regional planning initiatives already exist through the New South Wales government's Hunter Regional Plan and the Victorian government's Latrobe Valley Authority transition plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This new authority would also cut across the work and vision of existing Regional Development Australia committees, which are undertaking a lot of this work and which also recognise that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to create vibrant regions across our country. The challenges will be quite unique. They'll be unique in western areas of New South Wales compared to some of the coalmining areas in the Hunter Valley and up in Gladstone. And, of course, there are the broader challenges across all the different and varied regions of our country. We see this with plans that failed to deliver. A one-size-fits-all approach is certainly not going to work across such a broad country. A national body risks a top-down Canberra-centric approach which does not fully consider regional needs and priorities. The coalition fears this plan is too Canberra-centric, while it pretends to manage the redevelopment of workers in regional coal- and gas-fired power stations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll turn to the recommendations that were made in the dissenting report from the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee's consideration of the bills. The coalition members produced a really top-notch dissenting report on these bills, and I just encourage the government to consider some of the factors that were highlighted in that report. Of course this is going to pass this chamber—we don't kid ourselves on that—but I do hope that in the fullness of time the government will consider reassessing whether a top-down application is truly the best way to achieve the outcomes they want through these bills. There are also some good recommendations here in relation to how this system, this layer of regulation, has not been fully considered by the Fair Work system. I hope the government does some workarounds there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new authority overlaps significantly with existing industrial obligations, including consultation, paid leave, union access and enforcement, without dealing with how these overlapping obligations should interact, and it takes no steps to harmonise measures that will cause confusion, uncertainty and disputation at the workplace level so that those things can be avoided. I think that's a critical part of this debate: this will be difficult for business and for employees, so why does the government need to make it even more difficult by creating unnecessary confusion and duplication when we can take action now to harmonise these measures? That would ensure that there isn't confusion and that there's clear guidance from the federal level which syncs in nicely with the state regulations as well. Why not take the opportunity to do that now before we get down to the business end of the transition? It seems to me that the government has missed a trick in not taking the opportunity while it has presented itself over recent months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition will be opposing these bills because they are a costly, union pushed IR reform masquerading as bills; they put pressure on small, medium and large businesses; and, most importantly, they neglect our regions and do not help those local workers who are the backbone of the Australian economy and who we should be supporting in this place.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="300123" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WARE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:03</span>):  I rise to speak on the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024 and the Net Zero Economy Authority (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024, which I will be opposing. The coalition will be opposing these bills for a number of reasons, and I will elaborate on all of these reasons. Essentially, there are five reasons. These are bills that Labor has promoted as supporting the net-zero transition, particularly in the regions. But when significant research is done into these bills, they're anything but. These are industrial relations bills, and the Labor government, in introducing these bills, is simply providing yet another gift to the union movement. The bills also show bureaucratic waste and duplication and show a top-down Canberra-centric approach, which is set to fail in delivering for the unique needs of the regions. The regions have unique needs that are different from those of the metropolitan areas around Sydney. But also, each region in and of itself has unique needs, and these bills are going nowhere to address that. Finally, they are imposing significant obligations on small, medium and large businesses alike, particularly within the regions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My seat, the seat of Hughes, is a metropolitan seat, so, when I was considering my approach to these bills, I particularly had regard to the speeches and the commentary made either by my colleagues who are members of the National Party or by my regional colleagues. I've just been present in the chamber for the member for Bowman's speech, and I was similarly present for the member for Herbert's speech. I think that, for those of us who have seats in metropolitan areas, it is important to consult with those who are in the regions, because they understand their seats the best, and they are unanimous that this will not deliver for their specific areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to turn to what these bills are actually about. It is stated that they will transition the current Net Zero Economy Agency from an executive agency, which currently sits within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, to a standalone statutory authority known as the Net Zero Economy Authority. Under the legislation, the authority's stated functions are: first, to coordinate net zero policy and planning across government; second, to facilitate both government and private participation and investment; third, to support affected workers; fourth, to provide First Nations Australians the opportunity to participate in the transition; and fifth, to deliver educational and promotional initiatives as Australia transitions to a net zero emissions economy. That statement of objectives is full of motherhood statements. That may well be the intention of these bills, but, when we delve into the substance of these bills, we can see that the legislation, as it is currently drafted, will not achieve those objectives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are two broad aspects to the legislation that in fact operationalise the authority's powers. One is the facilitating of new investment in the net zero transition. It has been stated that the authority will be a shopfront for industry and investors. It will seek to work with project proponents and state governments to get renewable projects to investment decision. That all sounds fabulous, but it won't do that in practice. The authority will mobilise public moneys through vehicles like the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the National Reconstruction Fund, with private financing support; address enabling infrastructure needs; and navigate regulatory processes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second main responsibility of the authority is to assist the impacted workers in that transition area through the Energy Industry Jobs Plan. This plan will allow the authority to utilise the current IR system to manage the redeployment of workers in closing coal-fired and gas-fired power stations and their dependent employers. This includes coalmines, for example, that are reliant on a closing power station. What the plan does not specify or anticipate is the types of employment that workers may transition into. Therefore we say that these are essentially IR bills disguised as bills for the regions and the transition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As already indicated, in the coalition's view, this legislation has significant flaws. As we found out the night of the government's failed budget, the government has already doubled the budget to nearly $400 million alone, with further funding to a total of $1.1 billion over the medium term. But this is establishing simply another big Canberra bureaucracy across the net zero authority, the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations and the Fair Work Commission. The government has been unable to detail the actions that this authority would perform. Instead of consulting with the regions, we will have a Canberra bureaucracy dictating to the regions what will occur in each and every region and what, in particular, will occur to their deployed employees. This is very important for regional Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The component of the Net Zero Economy Authority that relates to new investment in the net zero transition is simply a bureaucratic waste. It largely mirrors the responsibilities of existing federal and state agencies, and we already have those agencies established. It is difficult to understand, then, why these are being duplicated and why this is setting up more Canberra bureaucrats. The authorities that will be duplicated include the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the Australia Renewable Energy Agency and the role of existing mechanisms such as the Major Projects Facilitation Agency. This is because the authority explicitly has responsibility for facilitating public and private sector participation and investment in greenhouse gas emissions reduction and net zero transformation initiatives in Australia, including in new industries. But this is almost completely copied and pasted from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation's legislated role. Then, when we look at the role of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, we see it similarly contains exactly those sorts of authorities. This level of duplication, when it is couched as being to promote new investment, is highly concerning. It simply is going to be Canberra again trying to dictate to the regions what will occur in their particular areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen with this type of body that it will simply be a national body. It's going to be a top-down, Canberra-centric approach. It won't be able to fully consider regional needs and priorities. We've heard already in this place from many members whose seats are in regional areas, and they have pretty well-identified and articulated individual needs for their particular regions. Therefore, having a top-down approach to say 'This is what is going to occur in all of these regions throughout Australia' simply does not make sense when one considers that every region throughout Australia is unique and will have unique needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also quite likely that, once established, the federal government will continue to add additional powers and responsibilities to the authority to support its net zero and climate ambitions. But it remains unclear—and I say it will always remain unclear—how this authority is actually going to assist workers in the regions who will be facing unemployment. Of course, when unemployment comes through those regions, in many cases, particularly in the smaller towns, the whole town collapses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We see with Labor's budget this year that the funding is now being budgeted to $400 million, with further funding to total $1.1 billion over the medium term. It's still unclear how many will be employed in this authority and what its specific tasks will be besides a very generalised view to supposedly assisting those in the regions who will be losing their jobs as we transition to new energy. We already have over $13 billion in taxpayer funded subsidies for big business, so this legislation goes nowhere and, indeed, will only add to this crisis we already have. It is far too much spending. Instead, Labor should be focusing on dealing with energy costs and high inflation, and its current out-of-control red tape. This is adding one more layer of red tape and one more layer of bureaucracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we turn to the impact this will have on small and medium businesses particularly, we need to look at the reality facing most Australian businesses not just in the regions but throughout metropolitan areas of Australia. We already have insolvencies at record highs and more businesses going offshore. Supporting a small number of big businesses in this area is irresponsible and a slap in the face for small businesses directly seeking answers from this government and desperately seeking help simply to survive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll turn now to the second-biggest feature of the proposed legislation—the Energy Industry Jobs Plan. This has been a carryover for many years from when the current minister for disability services, Bill Shorten, was leader, and it has been part of the ALP national platform going back to 2018. Australia's current industrial framework already features a well-established safety net that applies, and has applied for a considerable amount of time, in instances of business closures and industry change, particularly in the area of the closure of coal-fired power stations. Therefore, it is unclear why this new plan is, in fact, needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As has already been stated, a further national agency to assist regions is simply duplicative of state based mechanisms that have been designed to achieve the same outcome. For example, if we turn to some of the specific regions: in New South Wales the New South Wales government has the Hunter Regional Plan; in Victoria there is the government's Latrobe Valley authority transition plan. This new authority, however, would cut across the work and the vision of existing Regional Development Australia committees, which recognise that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to creating vibrant regions. Therefore, these bills are again going to add another layer of regulation that has not already been considered by the fair work system. How this authority and how these bills, and the regime they are setting out, will work with the existing fair work system is completely unclear. It appears there will be significant overlap with existing industrial obligations without in any way setting out how those existing obligations, in the case of interaction, will play out. Therefore, for all these reasons, the coalition and I will be opposing these bills.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:18</span>):  These bills, the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024 and the Net Zero Economy Authority (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024, are fundamentally a bureaucratic waste that impose a harsh new series of obligations on small, medium and large businesses. The Albanese Labor government's ideological obsession with top-down, Canberra centric approaches is going to cost taxpayers some $1.1 billion over the medium term, with these bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bills are nothing more than another set of industrial relations bills to serve Labor's union donors, disguised as bills for the regions. The authority explicitly has responsibility for facilitating public and private sector participation, investment in greenhouse gas emissions, and reduction and net zero transformation initiatives in Australia, including in new industries. This provision is almost copied and pasted from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation's legislated role to 'facilitate increased flows of finance into the clean energy sector and to facilitate the achievement of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The level of duplication between the proposed Net Zero Economy Authority's responsibility to promote new investment in the net zero transition and existing Commonwealth entities is another example of this government's obsession with red tape and union agendas. How many federal agencies tasked with renewable financing does the Commonwealth require? We've got this one which is being set up. We've got the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and Labor's Rewiring the Nation program. Adding all this up, it's billions of dollars.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know what this will do to local economies, particularly in regional seats which currently have gas and coal closures and which currently have power stations. In a regional centre, what exactly will happen to that economy? It's not just the workers in those power stations that will disappear; it's all the small and family businesses associated in that local region. It might be the local butcher supplying fresh meat from farms in the area. It might be local advertising companies, sign-writers and so forth, who write the signs for the local butchers and other small businesses in the area. If the workers disappear, what happens to the local hairdressers and barbers, and the local cleaning companies that go in and clean where these workers are going from or who clean the toilets and the lunchrooms and everything else? There are the local real estate agents as well who sell properties in the area or lease them to new people coming in. Prior to coming into this place, I used to run a pest control business. What happens to local pest controllers, who make sure the place isn't overrun with cockies and rats and everything else? None of them get anything in this. There are the local pubs and local cafes, the people supplying lunches and coffees in the morning, and the volunteer organisations that look after the families who are involved in the area, maybe at the local church, the local football club or the local Lions Club. As people are taken out of the regions, what happens to all of them? There is nothing in these bills to help them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's net-zero targets are fundamentally about closing coal and closing gas, and not replacing them with any other baseload energy. They said no to emissions-free modern nuclear power. They want to do everything with solar and wind—all made in China, by the way. The only solar panels made in this country are Tindo Solar. I've got them on my roof. They're $100 more expensive than every other solar panel you can buy. Everything else is made in China. We had the minister in here crowing the other day in question time about all the solar farms that he had rolled out. Once again, not one of those panels is made by Tindo, I can tell you. They're all imported. The Australian people understand that, that you're replacing Australian minerals, coal and gas with Chinese-made solar panels and Chinese-made wind farms that aren't renewable—they've got to be buried. They last 25 years max—possibly 25 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer delivered a budget the other night, with a big deficit next year—$43 billion—but a small surplus this year built on the back of coal, gas and other mining activities. They're replacing it all with Chinese-made wind farms, and the minister won't consider alternatives. So it is a real concern. We know from the actions already of this government that, once the authority is established, the government will continue to ram new and additional responsibility into this authority to support its net zero climate ambitions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The union movement wants the Net Zero Economy Authority to be legislated because the authority will be able to collect the personal information of employees at coal-fired power stations, from financial records to phone numbers, and the bills do not even require the relevant employee's consent for their information to be passed from their employer onto the Net Zero Economy Authority. These aren't bills for Australia; these are bills for the Albanese Labor government's union donors, as we have often seen in this place over the past couple years with different legislation that has come through. If you look at the biggest expenditure in the budget the other night for the minister for workplace relations, it wasn't even mentioned in his press release after the budget. It was all about another $60 million for the unions. So these are essentially industrial relations bills disguised as bills for the regions and transition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition will oppose these bills due to their bureaucratic waste and duplication and a top-down approach based here in Canberra which is set to fail on delivering on the unique needs of the regions, which I have partly outlined and which other members, particularly Queensland members like the member for Hinkler and the member for Capricornia, have partly outlined as well. We will oppose these bills due to the imposition on family, small, medium and large businesses and the fact that this is another example of Labor's haphazard approach on industry policy which delivers no guarantees for local workers. There is no guarantee here at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under Labor's renewable-only plan, there is a risk of major job losses. Jobs will be lost in mining in the coal and gas sector and in all of those small and medium businesses that I just outlined a moment ago. What are these people going to do when they lose their jobs? They have families. They have mortgages or they pay rent. These people have already been doing it tough under the last couple of years with inflation and cost-of-living increases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mark from North Lakes in my electorate asked me these questions just on the weekend. He said, 'What is the current government doing to grow our economy?' It's returning Australian manufacturing locally, but the way I estimate it we have lost 100,000 jobs in manufacturing in the last few years. That's from the horse's mouth. It's from the minister for manufacturing, Minister Husic. He said that there are 900,000 jobs in Australian manufacturing. We know that during COVID there were around a million manufacturing jobs. In the last two years, since Scott Morrison has no longer been Prime Minister, 10 per cent of manufacturing jobs have gone. But, if you listen to the government, they're talking in these bills about everything being Australian made. That's not what's happening in reality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My constituent also said: 'The current cost of living is out of control. What's the plan for the next six months to lower it? Have they considered lowering the fuel excise or a reduction in interest rates?' These bills are going to add another $1 billion of spending on top of, we estimate, $315 billion in additional spending since the government was elected in the forward estimates over the next four years. If you take the last budget of the Morrison government, $315 billion additional, on top of that, in the last two years is within the forward estimates. That will add to inflation. Mark asked, 'How is the current government assisting small businesses to remain economically viable instead of charging more tax with fewer deductions and having woke, green incentive deductions which aren't viable for the majority of small businesses?' Mark sums it up well given that we are talking about the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill, which is another $1 billion with nothing for small and family businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">John from Griffin said: 'My burning question is: what happens when we reach net zero? Having spent billions of dollars, when will we get a return on investment?' The government often says, 'We are a net zero superpower.' What does that mean? It sounds good. It sounds good in elections—'We are going to be a net-zero, renewable energy superpower.' They are selling off. They are going to close everything down. Everything's going to be made in China. They have some sort of plan—'We are going to make some solar panels here.' It's $100 extra for Tindo panels. Not everyone can afford that, and this minister will not consider modern nuclear power, which is emissions free. We could actually use uranium and so forth that's in the ground here. In the budget they're extending the good work that the member for Hinkler did when he was resources minister of mapping the minerals in the ground throughout Australia. I wonder whether they'll even include uranium in that. I doubt it. That's a good capacity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that, if this minister is serious about looking after Australians and is really serious about achieving net zero, he wouldn't just automatically rule out modern nuclear power that has zero emissions, would he? We could actually mine some of the resources for it here to replace the coal and gas that they are closing down. We could build a station where coal and gas are shutting down, and all of those are small and family businesses that I mentioned earlier—from the butchers, the hairdressers and the real estate agents to the pest controllers and the volunteer organisations—would remain viable in the regions, because that's where you'd put the modern nuclear power reactor that has zero emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, no, we can't do that. Despite the fact that they're continuing on with and have signed up to AUKUS, which Scott Morrison negotiated, and despite the fact that we currently have a nuclear reactor in the middle of Sydney, and have had for 50 years, he won't consider any of that. There are so many people that basically support it, including former prime minister Bob Hawke, Dick Smith and Tony Irwin. He was on 4BC Brisbane the other day, He's a nuclear expert who has worked on eight power stations in Britain with their energy agency.</span>

We wouldn't the environmental footprint that this government wants with solar and wind only. That footprint is 370 times bigger than that of a modern nuclear power station. You've got a bit of paper like the one I have here. That's the footprint on the environment that we currently have for coal and gas or we would have if we replaced it with an emissions-free nuclear plant. To get the same amount of power, the Albanese Labor government is going to need 370 times that. What is the impact on the environment—on the trees, the koalas, the wedge-tailed eagles and everything else? They don't want to talk about any of that.</span>

Snowy Hydro alone is going to cost $12 billion. What's all this costing? It will be another billion dollars here for another authority. No. They're not serious about it, and the Australian people are waking up.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="240756" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PASIN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:33</span>):  Every now and then you get an opportunity to reflect on what happens constantly in this place. Increasingly in this place, we get bills whose titles fail to reflect what is actually going on. Rather, they're drafted in a way—the title, in particular—that sends some spiffy message out of this place or, equally, they're designed as a wedge. For example, who wouldn't want to vote for the nature positive bill? And, just as a precursor to what may or may not happen in the party room tomorrow, I'm not sure I'm someone who would, but the title of the bill would suggest that you should. We all want to be positive, and we want to be positive about the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I looked at this bill and its title, the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024, and the related bill, I thought, 'Maybe some honesty, finally, from those opposite,' because I read 'net zero economy bill,' and I thought: 'Maybe they're finally being honest about what their ideological pursuit of net zero climate change policy will do to this economy. It will reduce it to zero.' But no, that's not what these bills seek to do—these bills which, Madam Deputy Speaker Vamvakinou, it will come as no surprise to you that the coalition will oppose. These bills don't seek to do that. These bills seek to spend $1.1 billion. That's more money than you can fire a rocket ship over. They are taxpayers dollars, real dollars in the real economy, not in the net zero economy, to effectively push industry—in particular, small, medium, family businesses—into the pursuit of net zero technologies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we just heard from the shadow Assistant Treasurer, there's no harm in net zero technologies. The harm is how you get there. These bills seek to spend $1.1 billion pushing industry in that direction, when what we should be doing is finding ways, through technology or other means, to allow this technology to be demand pulled through rather than, let's call it, regulation pushed. We know it's regulation pushed because these bills call for the creation of a whole new bureaucracy. The aim of that new bureaucracy is to do the regulation pushing to force industry and business to adopt this approach. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That would be bad enough, if it weren't duplicative, but it's doubly bad because many of these agencies seeking to facilitate the new investment into the net zero transition exist. They exist today. They operate today. But that's not enough for those opposite. Ultimately, there needs to be a new bureaucracy created to do the work that the Clean Energy Finance Corporation is doing today and that the Australian Renewable Energy Agency—ARENA—is doing today. A whole new bureaucracy to do what we're already doing and, worse, to push businesses in this direction, to drive up the costs of doing business, which we all know—those of us who've spent time in the real world—drives up cost-of-living pressures because businesses either fold or drive their prices up. When they fold, often enough they face import competition, meaning consumers are buying goods from other jurisdictions—many of whom, by the way, aren't climate obsessed in the way that the government opposite tends to be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some themes emerging from this government. It's said that when the government changes, the country changes. This is another example of top-down, Canberra-centric decision-making which is purporting to be about the regions. It's said that a lot of this net zero economy will deliver dividends to the regions. That's a very Canberra-centric decision matrix because I've got to tell you that you just need to look at who the people of regional Australia elect and bring to this place. They don't sit, on average, on the seats opposite. They sit over here. They want a practical and sensible approach to environmental policy and they want a practical and sensible approach to energy policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The shadow Assistant Treasurer was just pointing out one of the obvious inconsistencies with the thought processes of those opposite, who are strident supporters of AUKUS—as they should be. I congratulate the Prime Minister for his comments today, shouting down the Greens and the leader of the Greens, in particular, regarding the very important strategic relationship between our country and the United States of America. Those opposite are happy to see nuclear submarines, Virginia class submarines, at Port Adelaide—I'm a parochial South Australian; sorry about that—and happy to see nuclear energy powering those vessels. They're happy for that technology to be used in submarines, manned by ADF personnel, diving to great depths under the ocean and coming into port at, in South Australia's case, Port Adelaide, a densely populated area. They think that's perfectly safe. But what's not safe, those opposite say, is to have the same technology creating energy on dry land. It's safe to have it in a submarine, but, if the captain of that boat were to get a set of jumper leads to power a coffee van on the wharf, he'd face a term of imprisonment. I mean, seriously! It's little wonder the Australian people are increasingly expressing support for nuclear energy as part of our energy mix.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This isn't the only policy area in which we're seeing Canberra-centric decision-making. Just before question time today, I took the opportunity to remind the House that the Australian wine industry is desperate for support. The governments of France and the United States are supporting their wine grape growers. In Bordeaux and the Napa Valley, with the support of government, vineyards are being removed. Why? Because we have fewer wine drinkers globally, who are drinking less wine. This is not, as those opposite would like us to believe, an issue of the temporary pause in wine sales into China. It's a product of the global mismatch between demand and supply. But Canberra-centric decision-making says: 'There's nothing to support you as a wine grape grower.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another example is that those opposite want to rip water out of the Murray-Darling Basin. That's another Canberra-centric decision. It's certainly not one made in the regions for the regions, as these bills purport to be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the greatest example of the disconnect between Canberra based decision-making and the regions is the decision by those opposite to phase out the live sheep trade. This is an industry which has done everything asked of it by government, by regulators, and still it will be abolished in this country. It sounds a significant warning to all agricultural industries: if an industry does everything a government asks of it and still faces being banned from trading, you need to think seriously about the dangerous precedent that sets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So excuse me if for one moment I highlight the Canberra-centric approach to decision-making which is failing to deliver for regional Australia. Those opposite say that much of the transition to a net zero economy will occur in the regions. It might happen there, but once the wind turbines are built, once our landscape is carpeted with solar panels and forested with wind turbines, the jobs will leave town. I've seen it myself. I've seen it as these satanic mills have rolled out across landscapes. These bills will deliver nothing for the regions. What they will do is impose greater costs, as I said earlier, on small, medium and, indeed, large businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some people like to laugh that there must be a money tree here in Canberra somewhere. Politicians—treasurers, and perhaps pseudo treasurers aspiring to be assistant treasurers—would like to one day shake that money tree. But no money tree exists, in the same way that industry doesn't benefit from unlimited cash. It turns profits, and it turns profits by selling its goods and services for more than they cost. And if you drive up the cost of delivering or producing the goods and services, then, necessarily, they have to cost more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite would have to be—have to be!—cognisant of that by now, at least. Let's face it, they spent a good 12 months pontificating about the Voice and spending, as estimates told us last week, what is estimated to be more than half a billion dollars on that endeavour. At least now I feel confident that most of those opposite have come to the realisation that the cost of living is the No. 1 consideration for Australians from day to day and it's the No. 1 issue that they want their government—the government they elected two years ago and trusted to office—to do something about. But these bills do nothing to address that; quite the opposite. You could make a reasonable case that these bills are purposely directed at driving up the costs of goods and services—most particularly energy, which is sequestered in almost everything, every good, we buy and almost every service we seek. And that impacts us at the supermarket—at the checkout, at the browser and when we sit down once a month or once a fortnight to pay our insurance and to meet our other costs and expenses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And while I'm talking about supermarkets: people often think that the cost-of-living pressures are delivered by increased energy bills. It's true enough that when a consumer in a household gets an energy bill, if it has gone up, it impacts on their cost of living. But that's only the smallest fraction of the real impact of higher energy costs. Fertiliser, which grows the food that comes to the supermarket, is energy. When it goes up, the price of food goes up. Fuel is used by farmers; when it goes up, the price of our goods go up. Factories, food-processing plants and abattoirs all use energy, and energy is embedded in those goods. Those goods are transported to market and, again, with the cost of energy going up, the costs of those goods go up. The supermarkets themselves face higher energy bills for lighting, refrigeration and heating; again, costs go up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And so this government, instead of coming to this place with bills which do nothing but duplicate existing facilities—fixated as it is on regulation push when it comes to this question, rather than on technology pull—would do well to trash, to bin, these bills and get back to the basics of what Australians need right now. They need a focus on lower energy costs because they need a focus on cost-of-living pressures. I encourage those opposite to think again.</span>

There is much in those contributions that those opposite could learn from. I stand here to speak on the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024 and the Net Zero Economy Authority (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024 and, once again, I reflect on the fact that we stand here, in this House, discussing a piece of legislation that fails to deregulate our economy. All it does is introduce more red tape, more green tape and more complexity. We know that there is another piece of legislation floating around this place that talks about accounting for scope 3 emissions for businesses over a certain size. That will flow through to our entire economy. Every time we turn around in this place, all that we see from the government is more regulation and, in this case, even worse, duplication. It is duplication in the form of bills that create a new agency to do what is largely already done by existing agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As has been mentioned by other colleagues, we all agree on where the end point is—net zero by 2050. The discrepancy is about how we get there. And, as the member for Barker quite eloquently pointed out in his contribution, energy forms part of everything that we do. People sometimes forget that. There is energy embedded in our cup of coffee that we have in the morning. It is not just from the barista making the cup of coffee. There is energy embedded in the entire supply chain, from when that coffee bean is harvested to when that coffee bean is ground and forms part of your cup of coffee. Every part of that supply chain has energy embedded in it. We have seen those opposite, despite their promises at the last election, preside over an enormous increase in the cost of energy over the past two years—some 12-odd per cent, and more for gas. For many manufacturing businesses in my electorate, gas is a key input. Again, it forms part of the energy mix in this country, and the consequence of gas prices going up is that everything becomes more expensive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's interesting to reflect, when looking at these bills, on the duplication they create. Essentially, as others have said, they are IR bills disguised as bills to assist the regions in a transition from coal and gas to clean energy. Well, can I say that wind and solar are far from clean. They're not even renewable; they're intermittent, which is why you need baseload power. That is why the coalition is talking about nuclear as a replacement for our baseload power system to complement solar, wind, batteries and hydro—a mix of energy types to deliver the energy we need across our economy. But, as I look at these bills, all I see is bureaucratic waste and duplication and, once again, a top-down Canberra-centric approach, which we on this side know fails each and every time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we want some evidence of this, we need look no further than the answer that the minister for energy gave during question time, where he waxed lyrical about the situation in Germany. I was reading an interesting article today by a German journalist, Georg Etscheit. He goes on to speak about the five environmental reasons why Germany's wind energy insanity is a major threat. When I read this, I'm going, 'Oh!' Given what this government wants to do with its net zero energy transition, as the member for Barker has quite rightly pointed out, it's the regions that are going to pay the price. When it comes to the topic of offshore wind farms off Newcastle, which happens to be held by a government member, or, heaven forbid, off Warringah, which is held by a crossbench member, or elsewhere in this country that is anywhere near sitting Labor members or members of the crossbench, who want all of this intermittent energy generation in our system, no, we can't have that. We don't want to spoil our backyard and don't want to spoil our ocean views, but it's okay if we stick it out west of the Great Dividing Range where our farmers are, where they actually produce our food and fibre and wealth for this country—over $100 billion a year of wealth they create through the produce that they produce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So let's have a look at Mr Etscheit's five environmental reasons why Germany's wind energy insanity is a major threat. I think it's a very prescient review of what is going to happen here. 'The landscape will be blighted by the addition of 10,000 wind turbines with a height of 250 metres. The natural bio types surrounding these turbines will be irreversibly ruined.' We have already seen to the west of Rockhampton pristine koala habitat bulldozed to put wind turbines in. I can tell you that, if that was happening in the Daisy Hill state forest in the Treasurer's electorate, there would be a hue and cry. But no; it's out the back of Rocky up on a range somewhere that nobody knows about, so let's not worry about it. Let's just do it anyway. Fortunately, the proposed wind farm project at Chalumbin, west of Cairns and next to wet tropical rainforest, has been scrapped—thankfully.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we don't hear about—the second point he made—is that 'endangered birds like the red kite will lose their habitats. It's estimated that, in an absolute collision rate of around 21 per year and with 40,000 or more wind turbines planned in Germany, the million mark could be exceeded.' We know that, in Tasmania, there are restrictions on the operation of wind turbines, to protect birdlife there. Their operating hours have been reduced or curtailed because of the number of bird strikes. We know this is an issue in the United States as well. But these are not taken into account.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He also raises the issue of bats and insects being severely decimated. They are also potentially a hazard for marine fauna. 'Wind turbines have a negative impact from pressure and sound waves on some animal species with extremely sensitive hearing, and the industrialisation of oceans could replace native marine mammals. If more and more offshore wind farms are built, this will have an enormous impact on the North and Baltic seas.' Those same impacts will happen here if we build offshore wind farms. I know it's an issue of concern off the east coast of the United States. The member for Forrest is here; I know it's an issue of concern for many in her community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last, but not least, there is infrasound harming people. People near wind turbines often complain of severe health complaints such as insomnia, dizziness, headaches, depression, tinnitus, hearing and vision problems et cetera. This is what we want to subject our country to. I ask you, Madam Deputy Speaker Vamvakinou: are we serious? This is complete and utter nonsense.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we look at these bills that are designed to speed up this process, it's interesting to note that the CSIRO conducted a survey recently and released its results around 10 April. As the ABC reported:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A majority of Australians want the transition towards renewable energy to happen at a "moderate" pace and most are unwilling to accept higher bills to pay for it, according to a major survey by the country's top scientific organisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know those opposite are fond of quoting the CSIRO when it suits. I haven't heard the minister for the environment and climate change quote that report. People don't want to pay higher bills for this energy transition, but that's exactly what they're going to get with this duplication, and greater and greater bureaucracy as a result.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to that, we're going to see prime farmland destroyed right across our country—buried under acres of solar panels and acres of windmills. The reason it needs to be acres is that the energy density that's generated by windmills and solar panels is nowhere near what is generated by a base-load power station, whether it be coal, gas or nuclear. They just cannot compete. If I look at the NEM fuel mix at the moment, I would suggest that 70 to 80 per cent of the power currently being generated in this country across the national energy market is coming from coal or gas. It's certainly not coming from solar panels and, unless it's windy out there, it's not coming from wind. There was one day last week, in the middle of a high-pressure system, where there was virtually no wind across the country and the windmills were producing less than one per cent of our national power grid requirements. How on earth are we going to sustain the manufacturing industry that the government now wants to subsidise through its Future Made in Australia policy when we have a fleet of windmills that can only generate one per cent of the required energy capacity?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I look at the NEM regularly, every day, because I find that it's interesting to see what the fuel mix is throughout the day, depending on the weather conditions. The best I've seen over the last couple of weeks was 20 per cent. That means 80 per cent of our required capacity was not being met. That means that our major employers, our small businesses, which employ over 50 per cent of Australians and which represent 98 per cent of business across this country, will have to shut down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I touched on earlier, in addition to this stupidity there's the introduction of scope 3 emissions accounting. That might sound nice for the larger businesses that applies to, but that will cascade through our entire economy. The large business will have to get the small businesses supplying their supply chain to report their emissions. That small business may have five, six, seven, eight or 10 different customers. How do you split out the emissions for each of those individual customers? This is complete and utter nonsense.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Added to that, last week we saw the government rush through the new emissions standards for vehicles. This will make the utes which all the tradies and many of the small-businesses owners in my electorate drive, or perhaps make their small trucks in which they deliver their goods, more expensive. Every moment you turn a corner with this government, you see more red tape or regulation. It's more cost, and these are more examples of why this government is bad for Australians; it just doesn't fundamentally understand the consequences of its policies. I oppose these bills.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="267506" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KENNEDY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:03</span>):  As a number of my colleagues have suggested, the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024 and the Net Zero Economy Authority (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024 are essentially industrial relations bills disguised as bills that pretend to be about transition and for the regions. But it's really the bills that will create bureaucratic waste and duplication—a top-down Canberra-bubble approach which will not deliver on the unique needs of the regions and which will put a very large cost on small and medium businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another problem with these bills is: why are we picking winners? We saw in the budget that this is a government focused on the squeaky wheel, the large corporates, the lobbyists and their megaphones. The likelihood of a government failure is much higher than the likelihood of private sector failure, but instead, we're putting government bureaucracy at the centre of something that is really a private sector problem. How we provide cheap, reliable and clean energy is a problem that should be solved by the private sector and by industry, but instead this government keeps thinking more bureaucracies, more bureaucrats and more government departments are the answers to this problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why aren't we instead subsidising gigawatts? When someone is using a TV or a car, or a manufacturer is trying to use energy, they just want a gigawatt that's cheap, reliable and clean. They're not ideological about where their energy comes from; they want outcomes. This is what the people in the electorate of Cook worry about, and they are extremely worried that they've got a government that's focusing on ideology. We have only to look at the budget to see billions and billions of dollars being pushed to one energy source over the other. Green hydrogen is being subsidised enormously, and we have $13 billion of subsidies there for big businesses. Why don't we let all the power sources compete against one another? Nuclear, renewables, carbon capture and storage—all competing for subsidies based on the number of gigawatts they provide. That is what Middle Australia wants to see from this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills are also about duplication and waste. How many government bodies do we need to look at financing energy? Currently we have the Australian renewable energy finance corporation, ARENA; the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, CEFC; the Major Projects Facilitation Agency; and, now, the Net Zero Economy Authority. What will this fourth body do that the other three won't? Why do we need a fourth body where three are? This authority has a responsibility for facilitating 'public and private sector participation and investment in greenhouse gas emissions reduction and net zero transformation initiatives'. This is almost copied and pasted from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation's legislated role, which is 'to facilitate an increased flow of finance into the clean energy sector and to facilitate the achievement of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets'. These are two energy bodies with almost identical roles, and now the Australian Renewable Energy Agency has almost a carbon copy of that role as well. What is this new body going to do for us? It's quite unclear when we've got three other bodies almost duplicating its role.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The funding for this authority is almost $400 million over the next three years and a further $1.1 billion over the medium term. In a cost-of-living crisis, is this really how we want to spend $1 billion—on a new agency that I can't explain to my electorate what it will really do and what it will do compared to the other existing three agencies? It's a staggering figure. I spoke in my first speech, last week, about the cheapest area of my electorate, Kurnell, where someone on the average Australian household income could never, ever afford to repay the mortgage on the median house. I've got people doing it that tough in my electorate, struggling for money, cutting their budgets. What is the government doing? It's blowing $1 billion on an agency we may not need. Middle Australia and my electorate of Cook rightly expect the government to be cutting its budget and holding the purse strings tight, because that's what Middle Australia is doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead, this government has been focused on bureaucracy. Labor is in a bureaucracy binge. Like any binge, you pay the price afterwards. We've hired 36,000 new bureaucrats since the last election. That's 50 new bureaucrats a day. I ask the people of Australia, I ask the people of Cook and I ask the government on their benches across there: does the average Australian feel better for having 36,000 more bureaucrats in jobs, taking taxes? Do they feel better off because of this? I don't think so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, as mentioned, these are industrial relations bills; make no mistake. These are not bills for the regions; they are a long-held union wish list item to get this in here. It's industrial relations by stealth. Australia's current industrial framework features a well-established safety net that applies and has applied for a very long time. This helps with instances of business closure and industry change and especially with those related to coal-fired power stations. We have an existing mechanism to deal with this. There are justifiable benefits in mechanisms to help keep jobs and employment in affected communities and regions; that is a noble goal. But in reality what this legislation does is give the unions a big stick to threaten employers to provide these employees with paid time off, facilitate activities to push up union membership and enforce obligations on dependent businesses that they will not be able to afford. There is no sense of the limit around what obligations, pay or conditions can be applied, and much would be left to the Fair Work Commission to determine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In his address to the National Press Club earlier this year the current Net Zero Economy Agency czar, Greg Combet, could give no guarantee on the transition of coal-fired power stations to green jobs in this renewable sector. There is a real risk that, despite this billion dollars of investment, these workers will be left with fewer opportunities than they already have and lower rates of pay. What I worry about is an unholy triumvirate, an unholy alliance between big super, big business and unions. Small and medium businesses are the ones being left behind. Small businesses in this country have never felt smaller, because large corporates and large governments have never been larger. What these bills do is further grow government and further grow large corporates. It's unsurprising that government and the large corporates they're cosying-up to are happy with this. They both believe their size gives them the power and moral authority to tell individuals, tell households and tell small businesses what to think. These bills are explicitly about prioritising large business, large super and unions over legitimate needs of small businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my first speech, last week, I talked about small business hiring while large businesses fire. Small business was responsible for all net new job growth in the Australian economy over the last 20 years. What we're doing is strangling small business with this regulation, with another government bureaucracy. While some large businesses actually improve productivity, start investing in capital and substitute capital for labour, what will this authority do? It will just invest more labour into a sector that has zero productivity. The government sector has for the last decade had zero productivity, and we are just throwing more bureaucrats at a problem they cannot fix. From watching this government spend $400 million over the next three years and then $1 billion, it does not look like a government focused on efficiency, it does not look like a government focused on productivity and it does not look like a government focused on Middle Australia. It's a government not listening to them; it's a government focused on ideology instead of the concerns of Middle Australia. This government has failed to explain how these bills will actually lead to outcomes Middle Australia care about. They want cheap, reliable and clean power. Middle Australia are sceptical of this, and they deserve to be. What is it about this fact base, because we're not subsidising gigawatts? Why aren't we taking the moratorium off nuclear and letting a gigawatt compete against a gigawatt? Why is one gigawatt seen as superior to another? Why aren't we subsidising gigawatts and letting the market work?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills also claim to be about the regions and claim to help the regions. But this is Canberra-bubble decision-making. This is not a body embedded in the regions and not a body that speaks for the regions. Increasingly we are looking to the regions to get the raw deal that subsidises the cities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, on nuclear: there is a nuclear reactor on the doorstep of my electorate of Cook. Lucas Heights is the sleepiest part of the Sutherland shire. No-one is scared about it; that reactor has been there for 70 years, and it's been responsible for great improvements and great exports in nuclear medicine. Products are sent there from all around the world, like Switzerland. There are products made in the Lucas Heights reactor that are made nowhere else in the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition will be opposing the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024 and the Net Zero Economy Authority (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024 due to their bureaucratic waste and duplication; their top-down Canberra-centric approach, which is set to fail on delivering the needs of the regions; and their imposition of new obligations on small, medium and even some large businesses. This is another example of Labor's haphazard approach to industry policy, which delivers no guarantees for local workers. Instead it's focused on picking winners, something the members on the opposition bench with very little experience in the private sector—it's no surprise to me that they think the answer to every tough problem in this country is more government, more bureaucrats and more legislation. Instead, we need a level playing field. We need moratoriums lifted. We need regulations lifted. We need to give small and medium businesses a fighting chance to compete with these behemoths. We need to give small and medium businesses a chance to get out from under the weight of regulation. Scope 3 emissions will bring in further weight of regulation as small and medium businesses try to report on the emissions of their customers. In the Liberal opposition we are focused on empowering small business. We are focused on giving them the voice that the Labor government won't because they're too focused on unions, lobby groups, big super and big corporates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This federal government cannot afford to waste $1 billion on Canberra bureaucrats in the Net Zero Economic Authority. It's going to duplicate the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations and the Fair Work Commission. These bills add an additional layer of regulation not previously considered by the Fair Work Commission. If you're out there in Middle Australia trying to run a small business, trying to run a corporation, ask yourself this question: Do you need another bill giving you more regulation on hiring people than is already there? Do you need another bill giving you more regulation on energy than is already there? This overlaps significantly with existing obligations but these bills don't even explain how these overlapping regulations will interact with those already there. They take no steps to harmonise these. It will cause confusion, uncertainty and disruption at a workplace level that can be avoided. There's no sense of limit around what obligations and pay conditions can be applied, and as much will be left to the Fair Work Commission to determine. For these reasons, I will be opposing these bills, and so will the opposition.</span>

                    <a href="138932" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TED O'BRIEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fairfax</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:19</span>):  I rise today to speak against the government's Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024 and the associated bill. In doing so, I make this point: by virtue of even bringing these bills forward the Albanese Labor government is conceding that the pathway it is venturing down to achieve net zero for Australia is going to leave regional communities which have experience hosting coal-fired power stations in particular with dire hope for the future—very little hope for the future whatsoever.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will get, in a moment, to those areas of the bills with which I have a specific problem, but I want to make a broader point upfront first. That is: despite lots of argy-bargy and hot debate on issues of climate change and energy in this country, there is bipartisanship when it comes to achieving the goal of net zero by 2050. But that bipartisanship does not translate into an agreement on the pathway the nation must take to achieve net zero by 2050. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The pathway Labor is venturing down is already creating consequences that are felt by all Australians. We know that Australians today are paying among the highest electricity prices in the world, and certainly the highest in our country's history. There was a day when Australians paid among the lowest prices for electricity in all advanced economies, but today we pay among the highest. Since Labor has come to office we have seen, on a weekly basis, on average, over 500 families signing up for hardship arrangements with their energy retailer. Again, it's another consequence of Labor's mismanagement of its transition to net zero by 2050 that is being felt by everyday households right across this country. That is a direct consequence. Around the country we are also seeing fear about the prospect of blackouts. We now have the Australian Energy Market Operator saying that we could see lights going out as soon as this coming summer, and certainly by next winter, because of the mismanagement of the electricity grid.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is all of this happening? It is happening because of the pathway chosen by the Albanese Labor government, which is creating real-world problems as we speak today. Regional economies, regional communities, are screaming out because they are seeing projects being built without any consultation and without any engagement. They are seeing their way of life and their livelihoods threatened because they are dealing with a government that has set arbitrary targets—including 82 per cent renewables by 2030—without having given consideration to the impact on regional communities. This pain, whether it be economic or social or indeed environmental—especially given the scale of the rollout being pushed by the Albanese government—is being felt today. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This brings me to the point of these very bills. Under Labor's policies, we are going to see 90 per cent of Australia's baseload power, which is 90 per cent of always on 24/7 power in this country, exiting the grid within a decade—gone, without any chance of a replacement being there in time. Where do the generators that create such energy lie? They lie in regional communities which have hosted coal-fired power stations. These bills are a concession on the part of Labor that no communities in this country are going to hurt more and be punished more for Labor's trajectory to next zero than those communities. This is effectively Labor putting up the white flag, saying, 'We've run out of ideas.' This is Labor saying, 'We know full well that you are a regional community with high energy IQ, you get this stuff and your workforces have worked in these assets for generations,' and Labor is saying, 'We have no plan for you.' And they are saying that and putting up bills in this parliament not empowering those communities to make the decisions about their futures but instead empowering bureaucrats. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a community centred approach; this is a Canberra centred approach. This is quintessential Labor policy—big government, big unions and big bureaucrats with no consideration for what happens on the ground. At what point will Labor put the communities most affected by their ill-thought-through policy at the centre? They're not. So what we see in these bills is a concession from Labor that these communities have dire futures ahead of them. After two years, the solution of Labor's best thinkers, their greatest minds, for these communities is: Canberra will tell you what to do. That's it: Canberra will tell you what to do. Latrobe, Hunter—this is what Labor's saying. Labor are saying to the people of the Hunter: we do not trust you to power your own future. Labor are saying to the people of Latrobe: Canberra will decide your fate. How confident do you feel now?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have proved they have no concept of the importance of 24/7 power. They are dealing with communities that have for generations powered this nation—literally. They are closing down these base-load power stations without any chance of a system being ready to go. They know that, by virtue of these bills, those communities are going to be smashed in the process, and the best they can do is create the notion of something else in Canberra, another bureaucracy—a bureaucracy that does absolutely the same thing, by way of mandate, as existing agencies. There's a clear overlap with the CEFC and ARENA. There are state bodies that do these sorts of things already. But that's alright. These guys—the Albanese government—are going to put in $1.1 billion. Guess where that goes? It goes to Canberra, to the bureaucrats. That's what this is all about, and the unions have been calling for it for years. Big government, big unions—that's what this approach is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now it would be fair if somebody were to say: why shouldn't the federal government at least learn the lessons from states that have had similar authorities in place for some years? Those authorities at the state level, which have sought to do the same sort of thing in the same communities, have come up with great ideas such as swimming pools and mountain bike trails. I mean, we are talking about hundreds of highly qualified workers who have the ability to run power stations, and the best this government can come up with is to replicate a process already done by authorities at the state level, whose best ideas are swimming pools and mountain bike trails. I mean, seriously! We have some of our greatest minds in these regions, and the vision of the Albanese Labor government is to give Canberra more money so Canberra can decide their future. The senior leadership team includes the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Climate Change and Energy—not a day of work between them. They're lifetime politicians who live and breathe this building, who haven't got a clue what it's like to get your hands dirty, to have a crack at a trade. These are the people who are going to be making the decision, together with the unions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we've seen at the state level, Mr Deputy Speaker Goodenough, we will see former Labor Party hacks filling the jobs, the roles, on the ground in this authority. That's the experience we've seen. Where this has been in place, including in Latrobe, former Labor Party hacks get the jobs. These bills won't deliver jobs for the coal plant workers. They will not honour their occupation, their family, their multigenerational contribution to their community. These bills honour the Labor Party. They honour the unions. They honour Canberra. This is about big government, and it's being done in the knowledge that communities are the ones who will be hurt. These are the communities who right now are keeping the lights on in this chamber. They are the ones who are keeping the TVs on at home. Ninety per cent of our 24/7 power will be gone within 10 years. Where are the government working on the ground with these communities to ensure that their economies continue to drive for the future? They are not doing that. There's nothing in these bills for that. These bills empower the unions and the Fair Work Commission. They empower the Labor Party. These are bills for Labor and for its masters. It is yet another dirty dividend to the union movement done at the complete rejection of the very communities that these bills make clear are going to be most hurt by their pathway to net zero.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In due course, we will put forward our pathway to net zero as a coalition. It is a pathway that will absolutely honour communities, especially regional communities. It is a pathway that will be consumer centred when it comes to its planning and design. When it comes to social licence, it will be community centred. For these reasons, these bills must be opposed. With that, I ask the House to think about these communities, do what's in their interest and oppose these bills.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="74519" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GORMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:30</span>):  After a very interesting contribution, I am pleased to be here and to sum up this debate on the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024 and the related bill. Creating a Net Zero Economy Authority is integral to our government's vision for a future made in Australia, a future that includes all of us, from our cities to our regions and to the most remote parts of Australia. The transition to a net zero economy will be one of the most important economic transformations in Australia's history. That's why I welcome the contributions from members in the chamber to this debate, many of whom have come to talk about what they want to deliver and their aspirations for the future of their communities, recognising the great opportunities for their communities as we make this big economic transition to net zero. This will be a new part of our national story.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to unlock all of the community benefits that this new chapter will bring—the new, secure, well-paid jobs in our regions and in our suburbs. Meeting the demands of the new energy economy means creating a supply of new jobs. That's part of building a better future for Australians. When the Prime Minister addressed our nation on election night in 2022, he committed our government to ensuring no-one is held back and no-one is left behind. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Net Zero Economy Authority will help deliver on this vision. It will ensure, as we build a shared net zero future, that there is a place in that future for every Australian, no matter where they come from and no matter who they are. Every Australian will be part of the journey to bring us to being a renewable energy superpower. When we commit to opening the doors of opportunity, the transition to a net zero economy is about widening those doors. It is at the heart of the future opportunities that we seek to build for the next generation of Australians. Our message is clear: the way we power Australia will change, but those who do it will not. That is why we must ensure that now we have the right tools to generate a bright and clean future for generations to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen great engagement from members in this debate on the need to take concrete, coordinated action as Australia transitions to a net zero future. I note that some in this debate have said that this new body is not needed. The government disagrees. Stakeholders have been calling for an entity of this nature for a long time. We have heard that call from business, investors, both domestic and global, unions, local governments, community groups and regional businesses. We have responded to that call. As the Prime Minister said in speaking in this debate, these bills reflect our government's determination to shape the future, rather than wait for the future to shape us. We saw the Minister for Defence Industry and Minister for International Development and the Pacific talk about how:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We must seize these economic opportunities. We have a great opportunity right now to harness this clean energy industrial revolution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I completely agree. This is as big as the industrial revolution. Indeed, I note that, when it came to the industrial revolution, we didn't have this magnificent parliament. We didn't have the Australian Constitution as that revolution took hold. It is now upon us to show that we can do this big economic transformation in an even more coordinated way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had a wonderful contribution from the member for Cooper, the assistant minister, who talked about her experience as a union representative and young nurse back in 1985. She noted that throughout all that time there was 'growing awareness of climate change' and how change was needed 'to reduce our emissions and protect our environment' and, importantly, 'We need to protect and support workers through that change.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For more than three decades we've been talking about the need to protect workers as this transformation happens. These bills deliver on that objective, having an enduring authority that will ensure that no worker is left behind and every worker is given the opportunities that they rightly deserve in the new energy economy that we seek to build but also to make sure that, as there are changes that are not necessarily in their hands, they actually have support through that process. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Chisholm came in and shared some of the community groups who are encouraging her to vote yes to these bills, to support them. She talked about the Baby Boomers for Climate Change Action, the Australian Conservation Foundation Chisholm Group, the Kooyong Koot Alliance, the Friends of Scotchmans Creek and Valley Reserve and the Friends of Damper Creek Conservation Reserve—community groups who know that this will deliver for their communities in inner-city Melbourne as much as it will for communities in our regions. We had the other deputy speaker, the member for Newcastle, talk about how this enables her to go into her community and say, 'You can be assured we're not going to be leaving your people behind.' That's exactly right. That is what these bills are about. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Fremantle talked about, again, Labor governments taking responsibility when there are big economic transformations. We did it during the global financial crisis, we did it with the opening up of the Australian economy in the 1980s and 1990s, and we're doing it again, taking responsibility. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the member for Hasluck who said the main bill 'is about ensuring those who powered our industries for decades are not left behind as we embrace cleaner technologies and methods'. I note that my good friend the member for Swan, who grew up in the Goldfields—a great region of Western Australia—talked about her proud time working in the resource sector. She's an engineer who's worked on the mines, and she said, 'But I am also someone who wants to see action on climate change.' These bills deliver on both. We've had contributions from the member for Bennelong talking about how communities like his are sick of governments 'wasting time and politicising climate action'. He said that his community 'wants consensus and they want action'. Again, these bills deliver on this. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Macquarie highlighted that these bills have an omission. Most bills do. These bills do not deliver the goal of those opposite to deliver a nuclear powered future for Australia. She pointed out, very clearly, 'The costings show us that nuclear is the most risky, most expensive option that we have.' Then we saw the member for Canberra talk about the action that's happened on this government's watch, and how we've 'already approved 46 renewable energy projects, with another 130 in the pipeline', and how, as a result of this action, 'We've seen a 25 per cent increase in renewable energy in the National Energy Market.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Corangamite reminded me of a quote we used to hear echoed back to those opposite quite a bit, which was a description of the energy policy under those opposite. Those who've come in over the last few days of this debate and made a number of assertions about how they could do it better and how they could manage it better, but the member for Corangamite reminded us that one former Liberal Premier went so far as to describe energy policy under the former Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government as a 'slow-moving train wreck'. That's what a Liberal Premier said about those opposite when they were in government. Again, I remind people that they might say they have got all of the solutions but they definitely didn't have them when they were in government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to address something that's been said by a range of members of the opposition in this debate. They have outlined and claimed that the Energy Industry Jobs Plan will create duplication within the existing workplace relations system. I note that, as is clearly in the explanatory memorandum that is right there, the Energy Industry Jobs Plan has been designed to work within and complement the existing workplace relations system. It includes a range of safeguards to ensure small businesses are not unreasonably impacted. Additionally, we have listened to business groups and have amended the main bill to further align the processes and procedures of the plan with those under the Fair Work Act. Again, those amendments are on the table for members to see. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw the member for Fairfax, just a few moments ago, bringing in all of the anger and aggression he's clearly learnt from the Leader of the Opposition, and the same old union bashing that we've seen from those opposite for years and years, huge amounts of partisan politics, assuring us that they've got all the answers. But still, the one question that not a single member of the coalition was able to answer during this debate—despite a number mentioning their enthusiasm for nuclear power—was where any of the promised nuclear reactors would be. Not one said that it would be in their electorate. Not one outlined where it would be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we did see some science from the member for Lyne, formerly the Minister Assisting the Minister for Trade and Investment, who explained to the House that 'nuclear power stations are basically big kettles'. I thought it was so good that, after he put it in <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard </span>once, I'd put it in <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard </span>a second time: 'Nuclear power stations are basically big kettles., So, every time we hear the outline that all the policy work is almost done, it's almost completed and there have been very careful costings in the coalition and lots of careful looking at where those nuclear power plants and nuclear reactors will be, we can be assured that they've also really thought through the complexities of nuclear technology, because they've come in here and told us that 'nuclear power stations are basically big kettles'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Others wanted to go further to tell us how much they understood the complexities of nuclear power. We had the member for Hinkler—again, formerly the Senior Minister for Resources and Water, who said working at an existing power station is 'exactly the same job in a nuclear power station because there is no difference'. Working at an existing power station, coal or gas, is 'exactly the same job in a nuclear power station because there is no difference'. I think even Homer Simpson would be offended by that!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we've had some interesting contributions in this debate. We've had interesting contributions from people who sat around the cabinet table for nine years—nine years of stop-start policymaking, nine years where they sold us direct action and no direct action was ever taken, nine years where they attempted to abolish and water down the renewable energy target, nine years where they had a clean energy target that they put forward and then abolished. We had a discarded national energy guarantee. We had one member of the coalition, when they were in charge of energy policy, say that energy storage was 'as effective as a big prawn'. And then, in their final year in office before the Australian people gave them some time in opposition, they oversaw one of the largest spikes in emissions in 15 years, with some 4.1 million tonnes of emissions. We saw under those opposite a dive in investment in renewable energy. We saw a lack of investment in storage. We didn't see enough investment in transmission. I also note that, when they were last in office, the establishment of nuclear power plants was not part of their agenda. It's interesting. I wanted to put all of that on the record as we look at what is actually in contrast in this debate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my final comments, I will say two things. One is to again thank the outgoing chair of the Net Zero Economy Agency, which has been within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet until, hopefully, this parliament enacts this into a statutory authority. Greg Combet has done incredible work in setting up this agency, getting us to this point where we have this legislation for the parliament to debate, and I want to thank Mr Combet and all of those who worked in the agency within Prime Minister and Cabinet. We hope to soon establish them into a stand-alone statutory authority with the passage of these bills in the weeks ahead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I conclude with this. The Net Zero Economy Authority will play a pivotal role in Australia's successful transformation into a net zero economy. It will help ensure that we successfully navigate the changes that are happening across the world. We want to make sure that, in the enactment of this legislation, we leave no-one and no region behind. Our government will continue to take action to build the industries and create the jobs that underpin our future prosperity. These bills are an essential part of that. It's for those reasons that I commend both the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024 and the Net Zero Economy Authority (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2024 to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:45</span>):  I rise to speak on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Getting the NDIS Back on Track No. 1) Bill 2024. As Australians, we should be proud of the NDIS. Those in this place who voted for its passage in 2013 and those of us who have seen the scheme through to its 10th anniversary all know what a life-changing difference this scheme has made to so many people. For people like Ian from the Murrindindi Shire in the south of my electorate, the NDIS has been transformative. Ian says that the NDIS funded supports 'allow me to live independently by helping me with tasks I struggle with on my own'. With NDIS support, Ian is empowered to volunteer at the local radio station and cast a line in some of his favourite local rivers. Ian says, 'If I didn't have these supports, I wouldn't be living the life that I want to live—independently and to the fullest.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS reflects the best of Australia, a country that showed its commitment to providing a decent quality of life for all, including those with disabilities. It shows the understanding that, when we help others to thrive, we all benefit. In my first speech in this place, I said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This parliament must work conscientiously to ensure that the incredible system the NDIS was set up to be lives up to the promise and hope felt by so many when it was created.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2020, I said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We all have a stake in a properly functioning NDIS, not only because we all might need it one day but because a society should be judged by how it treats its most vulnerable …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These statements are as true today as they were then.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since being elected as the Independent member for Indi, I have consistently advocated for the 4,700 NDIS participants in my electorate, who face unique challenges in accessing and benefitting from the NDIS. When the Tune review into the NDIS occurred in 2019, I was, in fact, the only member of this place to make a submission. I called for the implementation of participant service guarantees, which would increase choice and control for NDIS participants. Because this was the most common NDIS issue I heard about from my constituents, I ensured that this was heard by the review. I will continue to fight for a better NDIS to ensure that it is delivering for all Australians, particularly those in regional, rural and remote Australia, whose challenges in accessing the NDIS are all too real.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While as Australians we should be proud of the NDIS, that doesn't mean we should not always be asking: How can this system be better? How can we better meet the needs of Australians living with disabilities either through the scheme or outside it? How can we better meet the original intentions of the NDIS? How can we uphold proper ethical and governance standards? How can we ensure that it is delivering for Australians in regional, rural and remote Australia? These are the questions I ask myself as an Independent when I am assessing the reforms put before us today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS does need reform. Any scheme of its size and significance will require changes over time. That's why I supported the recommendations of the 2019 review into the NDIS Act and I welcomed another comprehensive review handed down just last year. I am committed to creating an NDIS that will outlast all of us in this place so that the next generation couldn't imagine an Australia without it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I identify eight major ways the NDIS is likely to change because of this bill. These will be implemented by changes to the NDIS rules, legislative instruments prescribed by the minister and negotiated with states and territories. Some of these changes are less controversial. These include requiring the National Disability Insurance Agency, the NDIA, to clearly state whether a new participant entered the scheme through a disability pathway, an early intervention pathway or both; creating the legislative basis for the new early intervention pathways; clarifying that NDIS participants can only spend their budgets in accordance with their plan; and increasing the powers of the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission to stop banned persons from working in NDIS auditing services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, other proposed reforms are causing palpable anxiety in the community. Firstly, there will be a new definition of eligible NDIS supports. This new definition will be based on the international human rights treaty, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability. Secondly, the bill will establish new processes setting participant budgets. These new framework plans will include a stated total funding amount and will be based on needs based assessments. Thirdly, the minister will be able to create new information-gathering powers to require that the participant respond to requests for information. Fourthly, the minister will be able to create new powers for the NDIA to change a participant's plan type. The government has said these powers would be used to safeguard participants where others may seek to exploit or coerce the participant to use their package in a way that is not consistent with their best interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill contains significant reforms that aim to ensure that the NDIS is sustainable for years and in fact decades to come, and the government has said this is the first in a series of legislative reforms arising from the 2023 NDIS review. Unfortunately, it is hard to say exactly what this bill will mean for people in my electorate, because so much of the detailed change will be deferred to the creation of the new NDIS rules. Earlier I outlined ways in which this bill is likely to change the NDIS, and it's unusual for me to say 'likely' after weeks of analysis and examination of legislation. But it speaks to a key anxiety around the way this legislation works, because we don't know what these new rules will look like and we're yet to see the government's formal response to the 2023 NDIS review. The government is asking participants to go on a reform journey without sharing the destination. The government is saying, 'Trust us.' The minister has committed to co-design throughout the development of the rules, but this is a community with a deep-seated trust deficit in its interaction with governments and institutions. 'Trust us' just isn't good enough in my opinion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent weeks I've met with NDIS participants and providers and engaged with leading disability representative organisations to understand just what these bills will mean for the people of Indi. What I'm hearing is that people are so anxious about NDIS reforms. People want to know that reforms will enhance participant choice and control, not diminish it, and right now we simply don't know. While the effects of this bill may be unclear, some things are very clear. It is clear that the NDIS isn't working as intended in regional communities. It is clear that people are waiting for months for NDIS plan reviews even when they're living in abusive or unsafe environments. It is clear that participants have money they simply can't spend because of the lack of regional NDIS providers. It is clear regional participants are forced to travel hours to access services, sometimes all the way to Melbourne from a faraway regional town.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What do I say to the people who come into my office feeling that they've got nowhere else to go? What do I say to the carers of NDIS participants who haven't been paid in months, due to NDIS plan review delays, but can't bear to see their clients fall through the cracks? What do I say to regional NDIS providers who are the only registered providers in their region but are verging on insolvency due to a funding model that sets them up to fail? These aren't profit-hungry businesses; these are community organisations employing local people and providing life-changing services, and I imagine there isn't a member in this place who's not familiar with stories just like these.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the recent budget the government committed $130 million to co-design NDIS reforms with people with disability. If this government is serious about getting these reforms right, they need to slow down a bit and go on this reform journey with the community. Put simply, people with disabilities, their families and their representative organisations say this bill has been brought on too fast, with little consultation. This bill has been introduced before the government has published its response to the NDIS review. People are being asked to trust that the government will co-design future changes, but there are no guarantees. I've identified five areas in which this bill should be amended as a priority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, the bill should be amended to guarantee co-design, and I would support amendments requiring that the legislative instruments be accompanied by a consultation statement setting out the views of disability representative organisations. Secondly, I support amending the new proposed definition of 'NDIS supports' to be broader than currently drafted. I've heard, loud and clear, community concerns that the proposed definition might limit how NDIS funds can be spent. I support the linking of the NDIS act and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. But here is the important part of that: the government can't cherrypick which parts of the convention it likes. The NDIS should support the implementation of the full range of rights of persons with disabilities, and flexibility must remain at the core of the NDIS. I've spoken with the minister on this issue and I do understand that there will be amendments circulated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, the bill should clarify that needs based assessments and statements of supports are to be shown to participants before they are signed. These fundamental documents must be reviewable both internally and at the Administrative Review Tribunal. If the bill is passed unamended, disability representative organisations are concerned that participants will be shut out from decisions that affect them with inadequate rights of review. Fourthly, the bills need to clearly state that needs based assessments are to be conducted by allied health professionals or social workers with disability expertise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And, finally, sweeping new information-gathering and plan management powers need to be stripped back. Unamended, there is nothing to stop the NDIA from kicking vulnerable people off the scheme simply for failing to respond to a letter in 30 days, and this simply can't be. The minister has assured me that this is not the intention of these changes, and that these powers would be used only in certain circumstances. I thank him for taking the time to meet with me about this, but, if this is so, the bills should specify the criteria that would need to be met and clarify that these powers would be used only where a participant is wilfully and fraudulently misusing the NDIS. Similarly, changing a participant's plan management type to one that is agency controlled is a significant decision, and the ministerial powers drafted are too broad. The community need clarity that these powers will be used only as a last resort and only in very specific circumstances. I do not support changes that would see participants punished or debts raised for mistakes or misunderstandings that will, understandably, occur from time to time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on the government to work with the community in good faith to improve this bill so it achieves its purpose of securing a sustainable, thriving NDIS well into the future. Right now, this bill is causing anxiety out in the community, and until I see improvements on the bill I will be reserving my position. I finish with the words I spoke in 2020: the NDIS is something that all Australians should be proud of—not just a symbol but a functioning, real-life commitment to the type of nation we want to be. I still believe in that commitment to become the nation we want to be. That's why I support reforms to the NDIS that are designed with the community, not for them. If we get these NDIS reforms correct, if we ensure that the NDIS review is implemented in genuine co-design with the community, then in another 10 years time we will look back and be proud not only of the nation we want to be but also of the nation that we are.</span>

                    <a href="DZW" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ELLIOT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Richmond</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Social Services and Assistant Minister for the Prevention of </span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Family Violence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:58</span>):  I am very proud to be speaking on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Getting the NDIS Back on Track No. 1) Bill 2024. This important bill is designed to implement the transformative recommendations outlined in the final report of the review of the NDIS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is proposing a series of amendments to the NDIS legislation, referred to as 'Getting the NDIS Back on Track', and that's exactly what it's doing. This has been a big issue in my community, as it has been with many members throughout the House, in speaking with local participants and providers, and we have listened and acted. These amendments are needed so that governments working with the disability community can really improve the scheme. The bill represents this profound commitment by our government—the Albanese Labor government—to recalibrate the trajectory of the National Disability Insurance Scheme, all with the overarching aim of reinstating its original ethos and significantly enhancing the experience of its participants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will usher in a new era of NDIS reforms that ensure the scheme can continue to provide life-changing outcomes for future generations of Australians with disability and for those that are in the NDIS now, whilst also ensuring that every dollar in the scheme gets to the participants for whom the scheme was designed. It will also bolster the powers of the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission to protect participants from illegal and unethical conduct. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the election campaign, we announced a commitment to a complete review of the NDIS that would be conducted by independent experts and timed to coincide with the 10-year anniversary of the inception of the scheme in 2013. The launch date of the NDIS review was brought forward by a year after we were sworn into government and were able to examine the urgent need for repair to the scheme. We understood how urgent that was.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In October 2022 the Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme initiated the evaluation of the NDIS in order to improve the framework of the NDIS and essentially to rebuild trust, confidence and pride in the scheme, because it is such a vitally important scheme. As a fundamental election commitment of the Albanese Labor government, the NDIS review really addressed head-on the need for repair after what can only be described as a decade of neglect under the previous Liberals and Nationals government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Led by an independent review panel, the review involved extensive consultation with the Australian community. This consultation encompassed over 10,000 contributions and nearly 4,000 submissions from individuals, families, carers and disability representative organisations. The culmination of this inclusive process was the unveiling of the final report on 7 December 2023, with 26 recommendations and 139 supporting actions, all crafted to steer the NDIS towards its full potential.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Crucially, the panel absolutely ensured that the voices of participants were not merely acknowledged but actively incorporated into the fabric of the NDIS review. Through consultations and much stakeholder engagement, the panel gathered insights, perspectives and, really importantly, lived experiences, which served as the basis upon which all the recommendations were built. This very strong participatory approach was instrumental in fostering a sense of ownership and agency among those most involved in and impacted by the NDIS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now the Albanese government is delivering on its commitment to build a strong and sustainable NDIS by providing a further $468.7 million to get the NDIS back on track. This builds on the $213.7 million to fight fraud and to co-design NDIS reforms with people with a disability, announced earlier this year. This year's budget will drive the implementation of key recommendations from the independent review. The 'getting the NDIS back on track' bill will provide clarity over who can access the NDIS; enable better early intervention pathways for people living with psychosocial disability and children younger than nine years old with developmental delay and disability; and improve how NDIS participant budgets are set, making them more flexible and providing clearer information on how they can be spent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of the changes to the scheme will be implemented through the new NDIS rules, which will be put in place following the initial amendments made by the bill. The NDIS rules set out the details of how the scheme operates. Again, those new rules will be co-designed with the disability community—continuing to keep the voices and needs of people with disability at the heart of all of the NDIS reforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At its core, the bill seeks to fortify the foundational pillars of the NDIS—namely, access, which is so important; budget setting; and quality and safeguarding. All of these are absolutely needed. Among the reforms envisaged are the delegation of rule-making powers for priority areas identified by the NDIS review, the conceptualisation of the framework for an early intervention pathway, and the enhancement of transparency and flexibility in the allocation and utilisation of NDIS funds. Moreover, the bill endeavours to strengthen provisions pertaining to expenditure within allocated supports and to bolster the efficacy of the NDIS commission. That will ensure that the participants receive the support they need when they need it most, and that's what it's all designed for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, this bill lays the groundwork for fostering a cohesive system of support for individuals with disability that comprises inclusive mainstream services alongside foundational supports. All the changes that we have made are based on the principles of empowerment and inclusivity and are symbolic of an evolution of our NDIS, one characterised by resilience, responsiveness and relevance. Of course, all of these reforms build on the original idea of the NDIS. When it was introduced, it was a transformative moment for those of us who were here, for this parliament and for our nation to have such a scheme in place, because, as we know, for many, many years it had been called for. I'm very proud to say it was a Labor government that delivered it, and it's now a Labor government that's getting the NDIS back on track.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, through these changes the government has really highlighted our unwavering commitment to inclusivity and collaboration throughout the whole implementation of what we're doing. The legislative approach adopted in the NDIS amendment bill reflects a key recognition of the imperative to co-design changes to the NDIS rules in partnership with the disability community. By seeking the input of, the feedback from and the expertise of individuals with disabilities and their families, carers and advocates, our government absolutely aims to ensure that the NDIS evolves in lockstep with the evolving needs and aspirations of its participants. That is what is at the heart of what we're doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All that is proposed in this legislation is backed up by our $468.7 million investment, which includes $45.5 million to establish the NDIS Evidence Advisory Committee, $20 million to start preliminary consultation and design work to help people with a disability navigate the services, $5.3 million to undertake preliminary work to reform NDIS pricing arrangements and over $213 million of recently announced funding to fight fraud and to co-design NDIS reforms with people with a disability. To fight any sort of fraud that potentially has occurred, it's vitally important to have that massive amount of funds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will say in my concluding remarks that this bill, the National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Getting the NDIS Back on Track No. 1) Bill 2024, represents a real testament to the resilience and resolve of all of those that it supports. I want to recognise all those who have participated and make sure that their input is heard. We are always listening to the lived experiences of people in all areas. In particular, with redesigning the NDIS, this is vitally important. All of us are so committed to improving the experiences for all Australians with disability who interact with the NDIS, as well as their families and carers. Of course, what drove us with that is the past 10 years, when we did see underfunding of the NDIS and a lack of commitment from the previous government. We saw and heard the problems firsthand, and some of the issues and problems that people had were devastating. We absolutely made that commitment, and I'm really proud to be here as part of the government that's delivering upon these reforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After that decade of neglect under the Liberal and National governments, we can now pave the way for a more equitable, accessible and empowering NDIS, one that truly embodies the principles of dignity, choice and autonomy, because that is at the heart of it. People with disability and their families know that they can trust this Labor government to continue to protect the scheme and absolutely get it back on track. Our government is committed to improving outcomes for participants and ensuring that every dollar of funding goes to those who need it most. That's absolutely imperative. With this bill and our investments in the budget, our government reaffirms its commitment to leaving no-one behind and to building a future where every individual can thrive and flourish.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, I am extremely proud to have been part of a Labor government that delivered the NDIS here in this chamber over a decade ago and, now, to be part of another Labor government that is committed to continuing to improve the scheme for the betterment of the Australian people. That is an absolute commitment. It is always Labor governments who are on the side of the Australian people, and we'll continue to deliver life-changing reform and provide all those supports wherever they are required. In this case it has been a long time coming, and we are very proud to be in government and be delivering these absolute changes to the NDIS that are long overdue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the bill to the House. It's vitally important that we get the NDIS back on track, and it's the Albanese Labor government that's doing that.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="176304" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:10</span>):  I commence by putting on record my strong support, as all of us in the coalition have, for the principles of the NDIS. The NDIS is a very important support for some of the most vulnerable people in our society. John Howard always used to talk about how some of the great heroes in our society were the carers and people who looked after our most vulnerable. Before the NDIS, the way people with complex disabilities got support from their governments was a very patchy framework across the country. Invariably, state governments in particular that had carriage and responsibility for this area had too much of a one-size-fits-all mentality or approach, and the principle of the NDIS—giving people individualised and tailored support for their specific needs—is one we strongly support here in the coalition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is interesting to have the National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Getting the NDIS Back on Track No. 1) Bill 2024 before the House, because the now Minister for the NDIS, when he was the shadow minister for the NDIS, didn't think there was anything wrong with the scheme whatsoever and didn't think there was a need for change. In fact, he made the comment as the shadow minister: 'You can't move around the corridors of parliament in Canberra without tripping over a coalition minister whispering the scheme is unsustainable. I'm here to tell you today that is a lie.' Now we have the same former shadow minister, now the Minister for the NDIS, bringing before us a bill which, if I read the screen correctly, is, as quoted in its title, the 'getting the NDIS back on track No. 1 bill'. So something has changed from the perspective of the minister, the member for Maribyrnong, between commenting that it was a lie to suggest there were any issues with the sustainability of the scheme and bringing a bill before the parliament entitled the 'getting the NDIS back on track bill'. Nonetheless, we in the opposition are prepared to consider supporting this bill, to let it go before a Senate inquiry and make sure we look at all the potential implications of what's being proposed here. We are indeed open-minded to anything that is genuinely about improving the NDIS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As our shadow minister, the member for Deakin, has very sensibly put in our second reading amendment, we think there's no reason whatsoever why the government isn't prepared to release the modelling it's undertaken that underpins the NDIS Financial Sustainability Framework within the bill, and to talk about the cost savings that are going to eventuate from the passage of this legislation and be honest with people about the impact of potential or inevitable cuts that participants might expect as a result of these changes. Those points articulated in the second reading amendment from the member for Deakin are very important points to make and ones that I expect the House will support when we have the chance to vote on this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to the minister's summing-up speech, because we've learned today that he's got an excellent speechwriter. I'm sure we're going to get something between a Gettysburg Address and a Martin Luther King style summation to this bill, if the cost of a speech from the minister is anything to go by—$620,000 for a speechwriter that the minister is employing, beyond all the resources of his department and office, for two years work. I looked at the minister's website; I think he's got 28 speeches on his ministerial website, so 620 grand is about $22,000 a speech—pretty good work! I made a big mistake in choosing to be a humble member of the House of Representatives when I could have been writing speeches for the Minister for the NDIS—$22,000 a speech! Some of those speeches were really just reading speeches for other ministers and one of those 28 speeches was reading the minister's message at a citizenship ceremony, which we as members of parliament all do. I didn't know the person who had copied and pasted that or printed that off for him would make $22,000 for the taxing task of doing so, but I congratulate the person that has managed to leverage that kind of spectacular financial gain from the minister. But, nonetheless, we do wait with bated breath for his summing up speech on this bill, given what we are led to believe will be the $22,000 standard of closing remarks that the minister will give to us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that we look at opportunities to genuinely reform the system because there are concerning examples that have been given to us or that we have heard about the way in which the NDIS operates. Every genuine dollar that is spent through the NDIS for people that genuinely need its support is something that we in the coalition support, and every wasted dollar is obviously a dollar that can't be given to someone that genuinely needs it. There are some bizarre things that we have had reports of the NDIS funding being spent on. Surely the most ridiculous is this claim that NDIS funding was provided for the cremation of an NDIS participant's pet emotional support rat? I had never heard of the concept of a pet emotional support rat. I suppose that's discriminatory. You tend to think of dogs and other animals. I have never known a rat to be an emotional support animal, but maybe that is my ignorance. Certainly funding the cremation of that emotional support rat I would query or question whether or not that's what the proud day of legislating the NDIS envisaged the funds being invested in. Let's be serious now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Administrative Appeals Tribunal has had cases disputed for what had been claimed to be reasonable and necessary, including an infra-red sauna and botox treatments. Someone tried to claim a Thermomix through the NDIS. There was tai chi and singing lessons. The most concerning, really, is the expenditure of NDIS funding on sex therapy and sex workers. Let's be honest: that's patently ridiculous. Commonwealth funds through the NDIS are there for genuine investment in helping people with a disability. I won't ever be convinced that paying for—not a legal activity, I might add—sex workers and sexual therapy through the NDIS is what the scheme was ever envisaged to be funding. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we welcome genuine reform that closes those loopholes, things I don't think anyone ever envisaged was what NDIS funding would be directed towards. We would invite and welcome Minister Shorten, in his $22,000 closing remarks to this bill, to talk about how this bill addresses those serious and significant issues within the system, because none of us, I am sure, want the fund to be investing in those sorts of faux supports that are taking dollars away from genuine supports that people no doubt are entitled to through the scheme. This is taxpayers' money. This is taxpayers' funds. Every dollar that is spent inappropriately in any part of government, whether it's the NDIS or anywhere else, is a dollar out of the pockets of hardworking Australian taxpayers. We don't want to see those sorts of things being funded through the NDIS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would invite and encourage the minister to talk about those sorts of issues and advise us whether or not this bill is going to address them. As the member for Deakin has indicated in his second reading amendment, there is modelling and other impacts of this legislation that the minister could reveal, publish and explain to give us a better understanding of how this bill is going to lead to genuine reform of the NDIS. We stand ready to support anything that is going to lead to genuine reform of the NDIS. It's abundantly clear that there are changes needed despite the current minister's view when he was in opposition that there was no need for any of these reforms. He claimed coalition ministers were whispering that the scheme was unsustainable. I'm here today to tell you that is a lie. He's obviously changed his opinion on that. We welcome his conversion on that and his newfound recognition of the fact that we need genuine reform to the NDIS. We merely ask the minister to outline, in his response to the second reading amendment from the member for Deakin, exactly what the impact of these changes is going to be, exactly what that modelling is and exactly what reductions in services are going to be. Hopefully, those reductions are no longer paying for the cremation of pet rats, infrared saunas or sex workers. Will he properly outline to people what the effect of those changes will be to service deliver in this scheme?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With those remarks, I commend the member for Deakin's second reading amendment to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr FREELANDER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:21</span>):  As a paediatrician, I've sat in my office many times with families who had children—sometimes young adults—with severe disabilities: things like cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, many other syndromes, many different iterations of disability. I looked after those families and their kids for a long time, and the one thing that all those parents cried out for was some certainty about the future for their children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can think of them. Some of the kids I got very fond of. Troy, a little boy that I saw with Down syndrome when he was born, developed something called Eisenmenger's complex, which is a heart condition that's inoperable. I watched him grow and develop. His father died. His mother was left to bring Troy up and care for him in his 20s, 30s and now in his late 30s and early 40s. She spoke to me many times—they were a working-class family—about what was going to happen to him when she was no longer around to look after him.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember Justin, with cerebral palsy, who was not mobile. He couldn't speak adequately, but, with the use of a computer and voice activator, he was able to communicate. He was actually very bright, but he clearly needed care all his life. His mum really wondered what would happen to him when she passed on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I actually spoke to Julia Gillard about this many years ago, when she was first elected to the parliament and she came to a fundraiser for Chris Hayes, then the member for Fowler. She said that what she really believed in was providing a support mechanism where all of us—the Australian population—carried some of that burden for those families, that we shared in that. That was the beginning of her idea for a national disability insurance scheme working much along the lines of Medicare. That came to fruition thanks to the Gillard government. People on all sides of parliament did support it, but it was her vision, and forever I am grateful for that and to her, as are the families that I cared for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS has provided so much for those families: the certainty about the future, the certainty that their children, as adults with disability, would be able to get the care that they deserve to maximise their potential for a fulfilling life. That's why it has been so important. Unfortunately, it is after years of neglect by the coalition. I had many meetings with the coalition minister responsible for this, Stuart Robert, about the lack of transparency, the delays in approvals, the lack of understanding of the importance of certainty for these families and the lack of interventions that could have provided enormous help to people with severe disabilities, yet nothing happened. The scheme was manipulated to the point where it became all things to all people. State governments walked away from their responsibilities to care for these kids, and the NDIS was left as the only man standing to provide supports. This has to stop. It cannot possibly be all things to all people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've heard terrible stories in my office about people with severe disabilities being denied support when other people with the same disability were getting amazing support. There was no transparency as to why. I've seen providers come and go and exploit people with disabilities to the point where the providers became the reason for the scheme, not the people with disabilities. That is shameful. Many things happened with no transparency and no oversight, so that the scheme was growing out of control. The people I cared for, the people with severe disabilities, were not able to access the supports they needed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I fully support the National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Getting the NDIS Back on Track No. 1) Bill 2024. A huge amount of taxpayer money has been allocated to unproven supports. It was allocated without any real understanding of the purpose or the need, and it was allocated to people with relatively minor issues. It is terrible that the amount of support you get depends on who advocates for you. It's terrible that providers have grown rich by exploiting the NDIS at the expense of their clients. I've seen that happen in my own electorate. There are thousands of people who deserve support but are not getting it, because of the lack of transparency and the lack of oversight of the NDIS. I fully support this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No-one knows the importance of the NDIS better than the Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme, Bill Shorten, who early in the process advocated the importance of the NDIS and support for people with severe disability. The NDIS has been extraordinarily important in the lives of the people I've looked after for the last 45 years, and it is wonderful to see how people with severe disability can now rely on all of us to provide supports for them. We help carry the load. We also rejoice in the better quality of life and the improvements in functioning for many people on the NDIS. I thank the minister for the amazing amount of work he has done in providing for people with disabilities—whom we all care for; I know there is bipartisan support for this bill. Importantly, this bill aims to provide transparency and oversight of the functioning of the NDIS and how it supports those with the most severe disabilities. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flynn</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:29</span>):  On 21 May I was able to reflect on and mark two years since I was elected as the federal member for Flynn. Two years have consisted of countless meetings, countless kilometres and very good results for our region. It has been an absolute privilege to serve our community. My electorate office team, consisting of Nicole, Kellie, Leanne, Melanie, Cody, Natalie, Lane, Taylor, Margie and James, have been able to help thousands of constituents, whether through assistance with general inquiries or through helping residents who have fallen through the cracks of bureaucracy. We've had some wins and we've had some disappointments, but our commitment to serve the people of Flynn has not wavered.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've held more than 100 mobile offices for residents in their communities to see me or my friendly team face to face. It has become very clear that Australian families and households and small businesses in particular are really doing it tough, and the people of Flynn are no exception. My team and I have called more than 20,000 people to check on them and see how they're coping with the cost-of-living crisis, and many of these stories have been heartbreaking. Over the last two years I've been able to ask constituents in the Flynn electorate: 'Are you better off today than you were two years ago? Do you feel safer and more secure than you did two years ago?' The Labor government has now had three budgets, but the decisions they have made have made it harder for those families and for communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians can't afford another three years of the Albanese Labor government. Peter Dutton, the opposition leader, has recently delivered the coalition's budget in reply. He has outlined part of his vision for Australia—to get our country back on track and to keep our nation safe and secure. He has outlined the following measures: to increase workforce participation by recommitting to doubling the work bonus for around 80,000 pensioners and veterans. The coalition will double the existing work bonus from $300 per fortnight to $600. Pensioners will continue to accrue unused pension work bonus amounts up to a maximum of $11,800, which can exempt future earnings from the pension income test. We will support small businesses by extending the value of assets eligible for instant asset write-off. This will mean the coalition will extend the value of assets eligible for the instant asset write-off to $30,000, and make this ongoing for small business. This will simplify depreciation for millions of small businesses by cutting red tape, boosting investment in productive assets and lowering business costs and prices.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will deliver more affordable and reliable energy by ramping up domestic gas production. This includes defunding the Environmental Defenders Office, which is halting vital projects through lawfare. We will ensure that gas is delivered to where it's needed by reinstating the national gas infrastructure plan and will commit to an annual release of offshore acreage for exploration and development in the Northern Territory and Western Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will incentivise junior doctors training in general practice, working with the Royal Australia College of General Practitioners in the Australian Medical Association. A coalition government will ensure that $400 million goes to provide junior doctors who train in general practice with incentive payments, assistance with leave entitlements and support for pre-vocational training.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will boost defence by reprioritising wasteful spending. The Labor government has announced an additional 36,000 public servants in its budget, costing Australian taxpayers $24 billion over four years. The coalition sees areas like defence as much more of a priority than office staff in Canberra, given the precarious times in which we live and the threats to our region. The coalition will prioritise Canberra-centric funding and make an additional investment in defence to rapidly enhance the capability of our men and women in uniform.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition believes that rebalancing the migration program and taking decisive action on the housing crisis would free up almost 40,000 additional homes in the first year and well over 100,000 homes in the next five years. Changes would include the implementation of a two-year ban on foreign investments and on temporary residents purchasing existing homes in Australia. We would reduce the permanent migration program by 25 per cent from 185,000 to 140,000. The program would then increase to 150,000 in year 3 and 160,000 in year 4.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to back Peter Dutton to be our next prime minister and get our country back on track at the next election.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265979" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr FREELANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:34</span>):  I'd like to talk a little about the shortage of primary care providers in all our communities. It goes around Australia, but it's worse in some areas. Certainly in rural and regional areas it's quite difficult. But it's also very difficult to access an affordable general practitioner in the outer metropolitan areas of our major cities. This difficulty in accessing primary care through our general practitioners has been decades in the making. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Traditionally in Australia, for many, many years, we have imported doctors from overseas. Every year, almost half of the newly practising doctors in Australia are doctors who've been trained overseas. That has equity issues because some of those doctors come from very disadvantaged nations with low national incomes. They spend a lot of their national income on training their doctors, yet we've encouraged them to come here. So there are certainly equity issues about training general practitioners. In the last couple of decades in Australia, our new medical schools have more than doubled, and it has been difficult for our own students to train in our medical schools because of the difficulties in admissions. Some would say that we've made it too hard for people to train as doctors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have an ageing population with more need for doctors. In that ageing population, we have the development of chronic illnesses, like cardiovascular disease, diabetes and dementia, as we're living to older ages, requiring more medical input. So there has been this societal evolution of a greater need for medical services. We need to train more doctors, but we also need to get more doctors moving from areas of advantage in the inner cities to areas of need. This has proven to be extremely difficult.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of the problem is that the incomes of general practitioners have not been as high as those of many of the specialties. For example, when Medicare was first introduced, the rebate for an initial consultation with a specialist physician like me was about $85. In comparison, the rebate for an initial consultation with a GP was only around $22. So there was a discrepancy in the incomes of GPs compared to specialists. Also, people in disadvantaged areas often have multisystem disease and require a lot of support. Yet the Medicare rebates for those patients were the same as the rebates for those healthier patients who generally live in more advantaged areas. So there has been this pressure on people working in disadvantaged areas and in general practice to try to maintain practice viability, especially compared to those living in wealthier areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have had a strange situation where, when we train our doctors in the general practice streams, if they leave a position as a hospital registrar to be a GP registrar, they lose all their entitlements available through the public hospital system. This includes things like sick leave, sabbatical, study leave, maternity leave and all the other add-ons that they can get working in the public hospital system, with overtime for extra hours et cetera. So there was a disincentive for many of our medical students to go into a general practice training scheme, knowing that they would actually be paid significantly less—about 40 per cent less—working as a GP registrar compared to a hospital registrar working in cardiology, neurology et cetera.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I am actually calling for a rethink of the entire GP training scheme and how we fund our GPs. We have worked beyond crisis point. This is something that has evolved over decades. Our government is doing what it can to improve people's access to primary care and take pressure off our hospitals by introducing things like urgent care centres and by increasing bulk-billing incentives, but this is only partly changing the problem and will take years to work. We need an entire rethink, and I'm calling for this tonight. We need a rethink of general practice and how we recruit and train our general practitioners, and we need it on an urgent basis.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BUCHHOLZ</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wright</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:39</span>):  This month marks the beginning of the Scenic Rim's world-famous Eat Local Month. Distinguished Queenslanders, local residents and tourists from near and far will gather at more than 120 events with local producers across the beautiful Scenic Rim region for a month of celebrations. Some may ask: what is Eat Local Month? These 120 different events are an opportunity to showcase local products, whether it be beef, pork, cheese, honey, vegetables or fruit. Restaurants—from Brisbane and the south-east corner as well as from the Gold Coast and the North Coast—who procure products from our region take over a farm in the Scenic Rim where they buy product and showcase the product in conjunction with the people who grow and make the product and local residents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Eat Local Month is now a cornerstone of our region's cultural calendar, and it's a testament to the resilience, creativity and passion of our local producers and the vibrant regional communities that support them. The Scenic Rim is a stunning landscape of rich, fertile valleys. It's a region blessed with a bounty of nature's gifts. Our local farmers, artisans and producers have long known the value of working in harmony with the land, cultivating produce and products that are second to none.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Eat Local Month is an opportunity to showcase this exceptional produce, to celebrate the hard work and dedication that goes into every harvest and to bring the community together in appreciation of our local food heritage. There are local farm tours, cooking classes, food tasting and farmers' markets. There are countless opportunities to connect with the people who produce our food.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the events, which pulls in between 5,000 and 7,000 people, is when local carrot farmers open up their farms. Families bring their children, with their spades and their shovels, as if prepared to go to the beach, and they pick their own carrots and pull their own beans from the vines and then return to their homes having a better understanding of where their food comes from.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we choose to eat local, we are making a conscious decision to support our farmers and to ensure that the Scenic Rim continues to thrive for generations to come. This year I was particularly excited about the diverse array of events planned. It was a pleasure to attend the official launch a month ago with our local farmers and producers to showcase such a magnificent event, which rivals popular tourist destinations for food like Margaret River, Salamanca Markets in Hobart and the Hunter Valley.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From the vibrant Winter Harvest Festival, which is moving to Kalbar this year, to intimate farm-gate experiences, there's something for everyone to enjoy. This Saturday I will be attending the Kalbar-BQ Gourmet Country Long Lunch, hosted by the Kalbar Progress Association, something on the calendar that we try not to miss out on. It's a great opportunity to engage with not only celebrity chefs but local producers and people who travel to the region from Brisbane. And it's always a great afternoon to catch up with local residents from across the district.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These events not only provide a platform for our producers to showcase their goods but also educate and inspire all of us to incorporate more local produce into our everyday lives. As the federal member for Wright, I am committed to supporting initiatives that bolster our economy and promote sustainable practices. I'm very proud of the fact that, when the Eat Local Month campaign started off, we were able to support the regional council with a couple of hundred thousand dollars to launch the project over a number of years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Eat Local Month is a shining example of what we can achieve when we come together as a community. It's a celebration of our region's unique offerings and a reminder of the importance of supporting local businesses and our local agricultural sector. I'd like to take this opportunity to extend my heartfelt gratitude to all of the organisers, volunteers and participants who make this program as popular as it is. Your dedicated hard work is truly commendable, and it's because of your efforts that Eat Local Month continues to grow and thrive each year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I encourage each and every one of you to take full advantage of the events and activities that are on offer this month. Try something new, meet the faces behind the food and, most importantly, savour the incredible flavours of the Scenic Rim. To make your booking, visit eatlocalmonth.com.au. Together, let us celebrate eating local and the incredible community spirit that defines our beautiful region. You never know who you're going to sit next to at an Eat Local Month dinner.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  Community organisations are the heart and soul of our community in Holt. Across the suburbs of Cranbourne, Clyde, Botanic Ridge, Hampton Park, Lynbrook, Lyndhurst, Narre Warren South, Pearcedale, Tooradin and Warneet, these organisations embody the principles of compassion, service and unity, which are crucial for a thriving community. In Holt we are fortunate to have such organisations that not only provide essential support and services but also foster a sense of belonging and togetherness. Their work ensures that no-one is left behind and that every individual has the opportunity to contribute and thrive.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise today with immense pride and gratitude to share the remarkable success of the Holt community spirit and leadership awards night, an event that celebrated the extraordinary contributions of 70 exceptional individuals within our community. These leaders have shown unmatched dedication in areas such as multiculturalism, sports, the environment, community services and many other fields, making Holt a beacon of community spirit. The 70 community leaders honoured at the event have demonstrated outstanding commitment to their respective fields, and their stories are truly inspiring.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We celebrated those who have enriched Holt's multicultural fabric. Our community is a vibrant mix of different cultures, languages and traditions, and our multicultural leaders have played a crucial role in promoting understanding, respect and harmony. Forty-five per cent of people in my electorate do not speak English at home, and Holt contains residents from nearly every country on earth. Leaders in Holt have recognised cultural festivals, provided language classes and offered support services to new migrants, ensuring that everyone feels welcomed.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the night we highlighted the significant role of community broadcasting in Holt, exemplified by MAA TV and Casey Radio. These platforms, run by volunteers out of passion, provide vital communication channels that connect our community, offering a voice to diverse cultural groups, local artists and community initiatives. MAA TV delivers culturally relevant content that resonates with our large Afghan Australian population, promoting understanding and inclusion. Meanwhile, Casey Radio serves as a cornerstone of local news, sports and entertainment. Through their dedicated efforts, these broadcasters ensure that the stories, achievements and concerns of our community are heard and celebrated, strengthening the social fabric of Holt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was proud to thank the work of volunteers at the Warneet-Blind Bight CFA and recognise the amazing contributions from CFAs across Holt, including at Hampton Park, Narre Warren, Clyde, Devon Meadows and Tooradin. The CFA volunteers put their lives on the line to protect our community from the devastating impacts of fires and other emergencies. Whether responding to bushfires or educating the community about fire safety, their contributions are invaluable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, we recognise our sporting leaders for their contributions to building community connections across cultures. These leaders have inspired countless individuals, particularly the youth, to lead active and healthy lifestyles. Through their dedication, they have nurtured talent and instilled important life skills such as teamwork, discipline and perseverance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the leaders promoting environmental stewardship in our community. Their efforts, from planting new trees to rescuing animals in need, are essential to preserving the natural beauty and biodiversity in Holt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These leaders have a profound impact on our community and have guided me personally through my journey as a federal MP. I wouldn't be here without the support of each and every one of them. Let us take inspiration from these remarkable people and pledge to support and celebrate the community spirit that makes our nation so strong and so great. To all those community leaders, once again, from the bottom of my heart, I want to say thank you, because without you I cannot do this job.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="IPZ" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHESTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gippsland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  In his 2023 budget address, the Treasurer described our nation's fiscal good fortune, the improvement to our bottom line, as a result of 'high prices for the things we sell overseas'. He wouldn't dare mention those things. He couldn't mention coal, iron ore, gas or agricultural products—those things we sell overseas. That was an insult to Australian farmers, blue-collar workers and people in hi-vis jackets who go out there and work in the mines. Labor has declared war on all these industries with policies which actually make it harder for regional Australians to live and work in the communities they love. The wealth of our nation, the strength of the budget, is on the back of hardworking regional Australians on our farms, in our mines and in fishing and timber, and this government shows no respect whatsoever to any of those industries. It is their work which pays the nation's bills, and we need a government that is actually committed to a stronger, safer and fairer country, not a government that is dividing our nation, like this Prime Minister and his ministers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The city-country divide is getting worse under this Prime Minister, and the worst example of this needless division was the ill-conceived Voice referendum. This was a self-indulgent vanity project. That was one of the problems. Wasting $450 million of taxpayer money was another problem. But constantly lecturing regional Australians about how they should think about and treat their Aboriginal friends and neighbours was the most galling aspect of this referendum. Now Labor is out there defunding the practical projects in regional areas because the people involved didn't toe the party line on the Voice. I am sorry—it gives me no satisfaction to say this—but I don't recognise the modern Labor Party. It has lurched so far to the extreme left and abandoned blue-collar workers for Green votes in our cities. This government have had two years in office, and all they've done is cut regional grants programs, whinged about the previous government, turned their backs on the hardworking families in rural and regional Australia and then paraded around regional Australia taking credit for projects they had nothing to do with. Regional Australians are worse off under this Prime Minister. Regional Australians know their families are worse off, the communities they live in are not as safe as they used to be and Australia is heading in the wrong direction under an extreme left-wing government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most important skills of political leadership is identifying things that aren't broken and don't need to be changed so you can focus on fixing the real problems in our community. Instead of making things better for regional families, we've seen Labor decisions at state and federal level to place additional costs on our farmers. We've seen Labor decisions to abolish the native hardwood timber industry in Victoria and to increase the cost of our favourite vehicles, and the biggest agricultural funding announcement in this year's budget, the biggest announcement affecting the agriculture department in the whole budget, was to destroy the live export industry in WA. That was the biggest announcement in agriculture: to destroy an industry in Western Australia. This Prime Minister and his cabinet are the most urban focused executive I've seen in my time in this place. There's hardly anyone in that cabinet room with even a partial understanding of life in rural and regional Australia, and they continually take the city focused advice of their bureaucrats. This Canberra-knows-best mentality is destroying confidence in our rural communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I want to give the Labor Party and the cabinet a bit of a tip: if the Greens are cheering your decision, it's probably a pretty bad decision. If the light green teals are also cheering you on, then think again. Seriously, the teals are just Greens with trust funds. It's obscene to watch members from some of the most privileged communities in this nation demanding, for example, that timberworkers in my community lose their jobs. Not only that, having succeeded in abolishing the timber industry in Victoria, now they want to see the ban go nationwide. The teals and the Greens sit back in their high-income-earning suburban seats, enjoying all the spoils of life created from the hard work of regional Australians, but that doesn't stop them coming in here and campaigning to take their jobs away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are very fortunate. We all live in the greatest country in the world. There is nothing wrong with Australia that a good government can't fix. I'm proud to come in here and represent the people of Gippsland in this place, and I will never stop fighting for a fair go for them and all regional Australian families.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="299962" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms DOYLE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Aston</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:55</span>):  It has been a busy few weeks in the electorate of Aston. My electorate has had a flurry of ministerial visits which I would like to highlight to the House. We were delighted to have the Minister for Education, the Hon. Jason Clare, come out to meet with some of our wonderful and dedicated public school principals when we held a principals' roundtable at Wantirna South Primary School. This gave our primary and secondary school principals the opportunity to discuss some important issues with and ask questions of the federal education minister, which they really appreciated. I say thank you to all the principals who attended on the day. It was so great to have them involved in such a topical discussion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ensuring everyone has access to quality health care is a top priority for the Albanese Labor government and for me as well as the member for Aston, which is why the Minister for Health and Aged Care, the Hon. Mark Butler, and I visited Knox General Practice and Family Medicine in Bayswater. This is a practice where Aston locals can access bulk-billing, experienced doctors and same-day appointments. The health minister and I spoke with them about how this government has tripled the bulk-billing incentive, which is the largest investment in bulk-billing in Medicare's 40-year history, and how that's helping them and their patients. This policy is all about making it easier for people, including those in Aston, to visit a bulk-billing GP and it's to assist them with cost-of-living relief.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was great to have the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Andrew Giles, come out for a visit and see our wonderful multicultural community in Aston. Together we visited Atul, Dikesh and other families and members from the Hindu temple Shree Swaminarayan in Boronia, who do incredible work in our community and provide a welcoming spiritual environment for many local Hindus as well as many Knox locals. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we were off to the fantastic Chinese Association of Victoria, CAV, in Wantirna, where the minister and I had a game of table tennis with the CAV president, BC, and their secretary, Dominic. We also had a tour of the CAV Chinese School, where students of all backgrounds attend and learn Chinese as a second language. This school has had some recent federal funding as part of the community language schools grants program. They were very happy to receive this funding. It was an honour to visit CAV with Minister Giles and discuss all of the incredible work that CAV does in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also had the Attorney-General, the Hon. Mark Dreyfus, come and visit Aston. We spent over an hour with the brilliant legal team at Eastern Community Legal Centre in Boronia talking about the work that they do for people in need in our community. Then, following that, the Attorney-General and I visited the Knox School in Wantirna South, sitting down with legal studies students as well as several year 12 student leaders. They spent an hour with the Attorney-General, asked some excellent questions and gained a greater insight into the world of civics, law and lawmaking. It was such an exciting afternoon for the students and their teachers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also honoured to host a women's working group with the Minister for Finance, Minister for Women and Minister for the Public Service, Senator Katy Gallagher, alongside the mayor of Knox, Councillor Jude Dwight. Local councillors and representatives from some of our local community organisations who assist women across the Knox community were in attendance as well at Swinburne's Wantirna South campus. From discussing what's in the federal budget for women to the work we are doing to prevent violence against women and children, there was a great deal of important discussion throughout the evening. I am glad I was able to facilitate the working group.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, the Hon. Catherine King, came to visit us in Boronia and announced that a new funding agreement has been signed for the $5 million Tormore Reserve upgrade and its new pavilion. Our government understands that local sporting clubs are at the heart of so many communities, investing in local communities like Boronia and delivering more modern, accessible infrastructure for the future. This investment will help deliver a new pavilion to ensure that the Boronia Hawks Football Netball Club, both seniors and juniors, as well as the Boronia Cricket Club will have the facilities they deserve, including the recreation reserve and sportsgrounds, delivering better playing surfaces, new scoreboards, lighting upgrades and new change room facilities. Along with $1.2 million from the Victorian state government, this combined $6.2 million project is fully funded and ready to be delivered by Knox City Council. I look forward to turning the sod when this project officially starts.</span>

Sui's the reigning world champion in dressage for riders with an intellectual disability, and, if it all goes well in July, she will be looking to compete at the Paralympics. Ever since she attended the 2000 Paralympics in Sydney, Sui has had her sights set on competing for herself and representing her country. Sui's parents have nurtured her dream with the purchase of a dressage pony and recruitment of a coach, Nell Marshman, from Upper Lansdowne. This July, in France, Sui will ride on borrowed horses, which is an extremely challenging task, especially when she is only allowed to have two rides on the horses before the championship. Whatever the outcome, Sui, you are a champion regardless, and I personally wish you the very best of luck.</span>

The grand final was a nerve-racking watch, but Ryan Edmondson's goal in the 91st minute, which saved the match and took it to extra time, had everyone out of their seats. This season's grand final victory was even sweeter because it was in front of a home crowd at a sold-out Gosford stadium. I was excited to join thousands of locals cheering on the Mariners with my nephew Finn. The team showed true Central Coast spirit and grit, never giving up. They knuckled down and fought to the very end. The Mariners are role models in our community, and I congratulate and thank them for the work they do with local schools and junior clubs. Particular congratulations go to coach Mark Jackson, chairman Richard Peil and captain Danny Vukovic, who has recently announced his retirement. It's amazing to go out on top, Danny, and I wish you the best for the future.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, alongside the Prime Minister and the Minister for Sport, I was delighted to meet netball superstar Liz Ellis AO when she visited parliament. I congratulate Liz on her recent election as chair of Netball Australia. It was also good to meet with newly appointed Netball Australia CEO Stacey West, as we prepare for Australia to host the next Netball World Cup.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My love for netball started when I was in year 5, playing at Baker Park in Wyong and coached by local legend Trish. In 2016, I was a proud volunteer director, bringing together Wyong, Gosford and Woy Woy district netball associations to kickstart the Central Coast Heart and make the long-held dream of a Central Coast premier league team a reality. We're currently at the halfway point in the New South Wales premier league season. The Central Coast Heart opens captain, Maddy Wild, who played her junior netball at Wyong, said, 'The opens team has been working hard and is looking to be a force in the premier league competition.' Opens coach Kristie Fuller said, 'The team has been able to put out solid defensive performances and is now focusing on improving their attack in the back half of the season.' On 15 and 29 June, Central Coast Heart will host premier league rounds 12 and 14 opens and under 23s matches at Niagara Park Stadium against the Panthers and GWS. I encourage all coasties to support Central Coast Heart netball throughout their season, especially their home games on the coast. I acknowledge the work they do in fostering a love for netball in the community and in building a pathway for athletes, coaches, umpires and administrators from the coast to super netball.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="299623" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr SCAMPS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:36</span>):  I rise to speak about the Northern Beaches Hospital, the major level 5 hospital in my electorate of Mackellar, serving over 350,000 people. Let me say at the outset: the professional staff at the hospital are incredibly hardworking and highly skilled. They must be absolutely commended for their commitment. But I hear repeatedly that they are stretched to the limit and burning out as they grapple with what appears to be a regime of cost cutting on top of the usual problems faced by busy public hospitals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Northern Beaches Hospital is unique in New South Wales as it is the only major hospital run as a public-private partnership. The former Liberal government of New South Wales, which signed up to this arrangement with Healthscope, promised the people of the northern beaches a world-class hospital. But I fear we have been provided with a hospital where the administration is driven too much by profit considerations. So, I'm very pleased that, following my advocacy, the New South Wales government has agreed to a performance audit of the hospital, the first audit since the hospital was opened in 2018. I would also like to thank the New South Wales Auditor-General for inviting my input into the scope of that audit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many reasons to be concerned. Reports in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span> say that Healthscope, now controlled by a Canadian private equity firm based in the Cayman Islands, is burdened with $1.6 billion of debt. Healthscope's auditor has expressed doubt as to whether the holding company for the Northern Beaches Hospital is a going concern.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the ground, I've been hearing about cuts to services and staff. Patient transport and security have been cut and nursing staff in the mental health wards and maternity reduced. I have been told repeatedly that there is a dire shortage of junior doctors, which delays admissions, ward rounds and discharge processes. Critically, Healthscope has not yet agreed to implement the mandatory safe nurse-to-patient ratios that are being rolled out in every other public hospital in the state of New South Wales this year. The seven-day-a-week GP clinic designed to take pressure off the emergency department has been closed 18 per cent of the time this year due to a lack of staff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Data from the Bureau of Health Information shows that wait times in the emergency department are growing and are significantly longer than the state average. Deeply distressing for our community is the fact that the hospital administration refused to implement the desperately needed specialised adolescent mental health ward, despite being granted $7.5 million from the New South Wales government for exactly that. I will not stop advocating to ensure that the people of Mackellar and the northern beaches receive the high level of hospital care they deserve.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:39</span>):  Last year I was contacted by Phil Coe, an economics teacher from St Clare's College in Griffith. He wanted to bring his economics class up to parliament to watch the Treasurer deliver his budget speech. This year Phil asked me if the class could again come up to parliament to see the Treasurer deliver the speech and also if I could come and meet with the students in the lead-up to the budget. It was really inspiring to talk to these young women and take their questions about the budget and the way our government makes choices on what to spend money on, particularly at a time when we are seeing the rate of women studying economics falling further and further behind that of men. As I say, it was really inspiring to meet this group of young women. I want to congratulate Phil on the way that he has helped his students to engage with the parliament and with the budget, which is a particular, special opportunity for students in Canberra, with such good access to the parliament, when they take that up. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This experience gave me an idea. I wanted to allow more students in Canberra to come and be part of the budget and see the budget delivered, so I ran a speech competition for year 11 and year 12 students to give their vision—what they would deliver—if they were the Treasurer, in 90 seconds. I was pleased to receive many excellent entries to that competition. Victor Ni, a year 11 student at Canberra Grammar School, won the competition, and I will share the speech in a moment. Angela Xie from Canberra Grammar School, and Lachlan Li, from Telopea Park high were runners up in the competition. All three students came up to parliament on budget night and were able to watch the Treasurer deliver his speech. I'm pleased to share with you the excellent speech by Victor:</span>

A week ago, I had the pleasure of hosting the Forde Volunteer Appreciation Awards. Our committed volunteers, as we all know, usually like to steer clear of the limelight, but I felt it was time that they were recognised and I wanted to take this opportunity to highlight the incredible work of these local individuals and community groups. I thought what better way to give them some credit than through some appreciation awards. A trophy or a certificate are just a small token of thanks from me and the community of Forde for all the time, work and effort these volunteers have put into our electorate. As I've said, I'm sure that many of us recognise the wonderful efforts of all of our volunteers across our communities. In 2023, it was noted that some 64 per cent of Queenslanders volunteered in some capacity. </span>

There were also some special awards handed out for years of service. I want to take this opportunity to commend Beryl Brown and Margaret George for over 20 years of service to the community through volunteering; Heather Christensen and Christine Johnstone for over 30 years of service; and Peter Davidson and Rodney Hammel for over 40 years of outstanding service through volunteering for our community.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Each person or group was nominated for the award by someone in our community. We then had a community selection panel whittle down the nominations to select our winners and the highly commended. Volunteer of the Year was awarded to Jan Bloem, Senior Volunteer of the year went to Felicity Torr, Young Volunteer of the Year was Khloie Cregan and Community Organisation of the Year was jointly awarded to Coomera Valley Rural Fire Brigade and the Kids4Kids Foundation. Highly commended awards went to Jenna Shanks in the Young Volunteer of the Year category, William Boobermien, Natasha Ross and Emma Garratt in the Volunteer of the Year award category. Sue Hutchinson, Kay Wilson and Heather Christensen in the Senior Volunteer of the Year category, and for the Community Organisation of the Year award, highly commended went to Nightlight Outreach and Loganlea Community Centre.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:45</span>):  My electorate of Boothby is very concerned about climate change and seeing meaningful climate action. We should have started action on climate change over a decade ago, and in fact we did, but the Greens political party combined with the Liberals and Nationals to scuttle the most effective and economic form of climate action—the carbon price—and plunged us into a decade of inaction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no quick fix here, but what has the Albanese Labor government done on climate action? We've lifted our 2030 emission reduction targets to 43 per cent, enshrined in law together with net zero. We've legislated to establish the Climate Change Authority and properly resourced it. We've put net zero in the objects of the CEFC and ARENA acts. We've legislated our $20 billion Rewiring the Nation fund and struck deals for vital new energy infrastructure. We are implementing a four-point plan for better community engagement on transition, and we've finalised the law allowing offshore wind development in Australia. The Capacity Investment Scheme will unleash at least six gigawatts of dispatchable renewable power and $10 billion of investment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've put emissions reduction into the National Energy Objectives so regulators and operators have it as one of their guiding principles. We're developing the national energy transformation partnership to help guide public and private investment. The safeguard mechanism now has teeth, requiring net emissions reductions from our 215 biggest emitters. The electric vehicle discount has increased EV sales to around nine per cent. The Driving the Nation charging program will see a charger every 150 kilometres on our highways. We've released the National Electric Vehicle Strategy, and we're implementing new vehicle efficiency standards. Around 75 per cent of Commonwealth purchases of cars will be low-emission vehicles by 2025.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're implementing all of the recommendations of the Chubb review into the carbon credit market to ensure that it's delivering real emissions reductions. The $1.7 billion to the energy savings program provides financial support to households, businesses and local governments to invest in renewable energy and energy efficiency, including for social housing tenants, and we're rolling out 400 community batteries around Australia. We're delivering support for renters and apartment dwellers to make transition to renewables through our solar banks program. The Net Zero Economy Agency will focus on the economic opportunities for the regions at the centre of energy transformation, and we've budgeted $2 billion to the vital Hydrogen Headstart program so that Australia stays ahead in the green hydrogen game.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Energy transformation and climate action are vital for the future of Australia, and we're ensuring that we stay ahead of it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="260805" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HASTIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:48</span>):  Australia has an abundance of natural resources. We're global leaders in coal, gas, uranium, iron ore, critical minerals and rare earths. These resources are the foundation of our prosperity and have powered the economic growth of our regional neighbours, and our world-leading standard of living owes much to traditional energy sources. That's why Labor's agenda to drag us backwards, cripple our productivity, lower our living standards and undermine our national competitiveness is so dangerous. It compromises us all. Labor are targeting coal and gas, aiming to phase them out despite Australia accounting for just over one per cent of global carbon emissions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In typical Labor fashion, they can't go past the new tax. Last month Labor drove straight over the top of the democratic process and rammed the new fuel efficiency standard through parliament. Put simply, this is a big new tax on new four-wheel drives and utes—vehicles like Ford Rangers, Toyota HiLuxes and Prados, Mitsubishi Outlanders and Isuzu D-MAXes and MU-Xes, to name just a few. These vehicles are critical to my community, and they're not just wheels. They're the muscle behind hauling boats and caravans. They're essential for tradies and farmers, and Labor's tax will slap thousands onto the sticker price of new utes and family SUVs. So I ask regular Australians today: why should Anthony Albanese choose your car? Why should he force you onto an electric vehicle? This policy is bad news for all Aussies who depend on these vehicles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But that's not all Labor is planning today. Labor is also planning to install massive ugly wind farms along WA's beautiful south-west coastline. Last month I made a submission against the Mandurah offshore wind farm, and I stressed that the wind farm would damage my community's local environment as well as tourism and recreational activities. But it's not just about the visual impact or what it does to our ocean floors, marine life or birds. Wind farms cost a massive amount of money, while delivering unreliable and unaffordable power compared to proven coal and gas. There are enormous sunk costs to this wind farm. The transmission and distribution costs will be paid for by Australian families and businesses, because many clean energy companies are unprofitable, requiring government subsidies. There is nothing clean, by the way, about the emissions-intensive manufacturing of solar panels and wind farms, which are often made with coal-fired power energy in less environmentally regulated jurisdictions like China.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As usual, Labor has its priorities all wrong. While communities like mine grapple with cost-of-living pressures, the Prime Minister and the energy minister are obsessed with pursuing their green dreams. It's unfair for Labor to expect Australians to carry the burden of their radical energy policies. Even worse, this proposal will increase our dependence on a foreign power, as most wind turbines are made in China. We'll be importing weakness into our grid while exporting our natural advantage in coal and gas. It makes no sense.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McEwen</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:52</span>):  Today I proudly rise to talk about some of the amazing volunteers and organisations that service our communities in McEwen. Last week was National Volunteer Week, and this year the theme was 'Something for everyone'. To recognise the diverse opportunities of volunteering in the electorate, I was able to pay tribute to some outstanding individuals. This included visiting the Gisborne Unit of the SES, where I recently met with Neil Cheney, Toriana Collins and Unit Controller Ross Evans and thanked them for their dedication and their compassionate service which they provide to the community, especially in times of crisis. Across the other side of McEwen, there's the Rotary Club of Diamond Creek. In organising the annual town fair, providing food relief for those struggling and managing community, members such as Steve Crosling and President Warwick Leeson OAM epitomise what volunteering is all about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two profoundly impactful Mitchell shire organisations are the Mitchell Suicide Prevention Network and the Mitchell Multicultural Community Association. The Mitchell Suicide Prevention Network provides vital support and resources for those in need. The Mitchell Multicultural Community Association is a vibrant testament to the power of diversity and inclusion. It's an honour to acknowledge Nikki Simos and Roslyn Stewart of the suicide prevention network for the work that they've done for so many years in helping many people through very tough times. It's at times when things are in a bit of a crisis that you usually find out that your friends are the ones that come and are there by your side. The suicide prevention network has done that constantly. When we talk about Dushyanthy Govender of the Mitchell Shire Multicultural Association, her commitment to the health and wellbeing of our community is second to none in the work that she does in bringing together people of all faiths and all ethnicities to not only share food and games but, importantly, share time. Learn who your neighbours are and build a stronger community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge the enthusiastic and energetic volunteer team at the Northern Pride Netball Association. They are the backbone of netball in the area and a space not only for the young participants to learn and develop their talents and a love for the game but also for a community that is very cohesive. Thanks especially to President Michelle Kneale and Secretary Sallyanne Bruton.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Romsey and Lancefield neighbourhood houses—well, what can you say  about them. The team of volunteers there in those amazing hubs are dedicated to promoting everything that is about community. An exemplary volunteer I want to thank, too, on an individual basis is Karen McKenzie of Whittlesea. Karen has taken this year's theme and is literally running with it. From volunteering at the Whittlesea Salvation Army op shop to her dedication at the TAC L2P driver education program, she has applied her talents to assist others, and she has made over 106 blood donations. So thank you, Karen, for the service and beyond that you do. Most importantly, I thank every volunteer, because without them our communities would not function.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAWKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mitchell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:55</span>):  I rise to record my concern about the New South Wales state government's increases to housing targets, but not in the way people might imagine. In my electorate of Mitchell, we will more than double the existing housing requirements, which I'm happy to say on the record is a good thing and a good decision from the New South Wales state government. My concern relates to the intersection of federal and state government policy, including on immigration, where Sydney accounts for 99 per cent of the population growth—170,000 people in Sydney last year—but we only built 46,000 new homes. This is a major concern for Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the federal government not doing anything about the GST mix in relation to New South Wales, my concern is not the growth in housing. I think that is substantial and needed. My electorate will bear the brunt of that, which I think most people accept, given the $10 billion to $12 billion rail line infrastructure that was built by the previous Liberal government. My concern relates to the funding of infrastructure and necessary services. For example, I've spoken in the House before about the chronic lack of public school infrastructure. We are opening the Gables Public School—it's being built and will open soon. It's already full. In the member for Greenway's electorate, the Riverstone Public School was already oversubscribed when it was built and it is now chronically oversubscribed. All the public schools around my electorate are feeling the pressure of this growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the state government that without proper plans for immediate investment in new public schools where new houses are growing at 2½ times the current rate—and have already been doing so for a while—this is a critical issue. I'm going to be advocating in a much more forceful way for the necessary infrastructure for police, and the Rouse Hill hospital needs to get underway. That construction really needs to be going asap in every single budget of the state government. If you are not planning ahead for public schools in these critical growth corridors where you are doubling or tripling the rates of housing growth—we welcome that, but we don't welcome the lack of investment in critical services to go with it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again, north-west Sydney will have to fight this fight. I call on the member for Greenway and others to join me in this fight. I call on the New South Wales state government to join in on saying that the planning, funding and work needs to be done now. You can't put houses in suburbs at three times the current rate without the critical infrastructure when those suburbs and services are already massively overloaded. The time is now to have this conversation. We will be putting pressure on the state government, and the federal government needs to come forward and rearrange the GST mix in a way that rewards New South Wales for that tripling of growth. It's thanks to the New South Wales Labor state government, but there is no funding attached to reward that growth in housing. I don't know what they're talking about at these federal and state housing ministers meetings, but surely there must be incentives, and there must be concurrent funding from the New South Wales GST mix to deal with the infrastructure requirements of those new communities.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:58</span>):  Deputy Speaker Scrymgour, I believe this is the first time I've appeared before you in your new role. Congratulations on your elevation to the Speaker's panel!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, I was delighted to host the Minister for Government Services, the Hon. Bill Shorten MP, in my electorate of Lyons. Together, we turned the first sod for the new Services Australia service centre in Sorell. At the 2022 election, I committed to a new service centre in Sorell, and it was a very proud moment for me, as the member for Lyons, to stand with the minister and start to fulfil another of the promises made at the election. Now that the all-important sod has been turned—I've got to say I'm not sure having two politicians with a spade is the most efficient way to get earthworks moving; I was very pleased to see Hitachi earth-moving equipment behind us—the construction of the new Sorell service centre can begin in earnest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The team at Tasmanian company The Young Group will be cracking on with construction, supporting 27 jobs in the process. Once it's complete, the service centre will have six full-time staff. It is expected to be up and running by the end of this year. The new centre will provide face-to-face access to Centrelink and Medicare as well as to Service Tasmania, a similar group at the state level. This centre will pioneer a co-location approach to government services in Tasmania. This is a huge win for my constituents, giving them a one-stop shop for dealing with different levels of government, whether they need to renew a licence or make a Medicare claim.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, it also means residents from Sorell, from the Tasman Peninsula and from the east coast will no longer have to travel to Rosny or Hobart to access face-to-face services. Whether travelling up from Port Arthur or from Taranna or down the coast from Orford or Triabunna, this will save at least an hour in travel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm looking forward to seeing more progress on Sorell's new Services Australia centre in the coming months and, indeed, on all the commitments that the Albanese Labor government is delivering across Lyons. For example, our $5 million investment into sporting facilities in New Norfolk is progressing well. Derwent Valley Council just last week approved plans for the construction of a pavilion and change rooms at Boyer Oval and new clubrooms and change rooms at Tynwald Park. We've already delivered on our $200,000 commitment to the Kentish Regional Clinic in Sheffield, supporting the service delivery of CORES, the committee network of suicide prevention training and awareness across Tasmania. I've just recently had an update that we are progressing well in our plans in Brighton and the $2.3 million commitment for upgrades there. We have other commitments that we are delivering on across Lyons. I am pleased to report as the local member that every single commitment we made at the 2022 election is being delivered by this government.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STEGGALL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:01</span>):  I strongly support this motion moved by the member for Curtin calling on the government to commit to an urgent, comprehensive and well-funded plan to increase our international competitiveness in decarbonised industries in the race to net zero and supercharge and incentivise investment in R&amp;D and local manufacturing. The demand for Australia's current export mix will inevitably decline, and we must prepare to transition to green exports as the demand for them grows as the world decarbonises.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government in its recent budget committed some $22.7 billion to the Future Made in Australia plan, and I welcomed that. It includes the minerals value-adding production tax credit, additional funding for ARENA, a hydrogen production tax incentive and further funding for the soon-to-be-established Net Zero Economy Authority. But I am critical of the remit of that authority and will seek to expand it, as it assists only some 10 per cent of the workers it should be assisting. It also included funding for the Solar Sunshot initiative and quantum computing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have made a start with that commitment on making Australia a renewable energy superpower, and I've met with small and big businesses across the solar battery and green metal supply chain. They've made it clear that projects and companies are at risk of going over to the US and other jurisdictions because they would get more support there. There are companies in my own electorate of Warringah, such as Empower Energy, who are designing solar battery products. We know that enhancements to our storage capacity are urgently needed. Fifteen gigawatts of storage is needed by 2030, and that can be achieved if around 30 per cent of households take up solar and batteries. So what we really need to see is a program to assist and incentivise the take-up of batteries by households that have rooftop solar.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In becoming a renewable energy superpower, we must ensure a just transition for our fossil fuel communities, allowing our regions to thrive and households to save money, and, of course, consultation and benefits sharing with First Nations communities. There is so much opportunity in this transition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst we're making a belated start, there's still more to do to ensure we maintain our competitive edge in the global green race. The development of the production tax credit model for critical minerals and green hydrogen to incentivise onshore value-adding is a good start, but it could be widened to other industries. Most importantly, as this motion calls for, we need a comprehensive plan to ensure that any measure is both efficient and effective. It's critical that we invest not only in the large resources and manufacturing companies where it's necessary but also in the smaller companies, the SMEs, that have already proved their viability as well as their innovation. We need to ensure that they are also able to scale up and grasp those opportunities with the support of government. We need to make sure that all these new opportunities come through and are also available to SMEs—and, I should say, businesses led by women. We can do this whilst also delivering savings for households and driving demand for the products from those industries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that in the US the Inflation Reduction Act has provided some $8.8 billion in rebates for home energy efficiency and electrification projects, which is expected to save American households up to $1 billion annually. So it is disappointing that, for the moment, the government has not focused on this. The Future Made in Australia plan remains silent on household electrification and did nothing to bolster already announced initiatives. The already announced household energy upgrade fund, for example, is, as of last week, only beginning to roll out its very first loans for household energy upgrades—more than a year after it was first announced. So I would say to the Albanese government: be careful not to become like the Morrison government—big on announcements, small and slow on rollout.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to see quick execution of these programs so that households on the ground can take advantage of them. We know that, other than for quantum computing, the budget didn't really deliver on a clear plan for greater investment in research and development, and that is an area we must address if we are going to stay competitive. Already, compared with the OECD average, we are dropping. We now are sitting at about 1.68 per cent of GDP. So Australia is not investing in being that smart economy that we could be. We need to make sure that the government focuses on this transition. The race to net zero is on. It is a race that is well advanced in most economies. Australia is playing catch-up, but we need to make sure we do it in a smart way.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="299150" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LAWRENCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:06</span>):  I thank the member for Curtin for bringing this motion on this most important issue, on decarbonised industries. The climate crisis and the actions we can take to help abate the effects of climate change should never be far from our minds in this place. Sometimes members in this parliament, particularly conservative members, seek to minimise the role that Australia, with our moderate population, can play in this field. I believe not only that we can play a leadership role globally but that we must.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the US passed the Inflation Reduction Act in August 2022 it was a welcome challenge to the world, indicating that the US was now serious about taking climate action and that other countries now needed to step up. This 47th Parliament had only just sat for the first time. In that same month we passed the Climate Change Act legislating our net zero target. But the member for Curtin says that Australia is lagging. And we have lagged, but we are now catching up, thanks to the changes, initiatives and investments the Albanese Labor government is making.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The main reason we lag in this area of policy, though, is the coalition and their failure to accept climate science and to base policy on evidence. They voted against the Climate Change Bill, and no serious voter should ever vote for the coalition until they get their heads straight on this. The Greens can take some of the blame, too, for playing their silly politics years ago. Greens voters should think about that. And every one of us, representatives and voters alike, need to take our share. In 1987 science minister Barry Jones stood in this place, down the hill, and stated clearly that planning and taking action on climate change then would avoid danger into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member says, we have an abundance of natural resources. The work Geoscience Australia has been doing needs to be mentioned in this regard. Last week Minister Madeleine King and Geoscience launched the world-leading Digital Atlas of Australia, which provides access to datasets on Australia's geography, people, economy and the environment. This follows the work by Geoscience and Monash University which won the Eureka Prize for Sustainability Research in 2023. And I agree with the member for Curtin that the approvals process needs to be examined and streamlined. The environment minister's approach is to strengthen our protection of the environment while providing certainty and speedier processes for industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fortunately, generally mining companies now do engage with Indigenous owners at the outset of exploration and development, which assists in approval processes. Two excellent examples are the MOU signed between Rio Tinto and the Yindjibarndi Energy Corporation for collaboration on renewable energy projects in the Pilbara and an agreement between InterContinental Energy and the Mirning people, with Mirning Green Energy a 10 per cent stakeholder in the Western Green Energy Hub proposal. The key here will be cooperation between federal, state and local authorities, which the Future Made in Australia policy outlines.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I agree too with the member for Curtin that investor confidence for renewable projects could be better. Confidence only comes after there is clear leadership, so it is no surprise that this has had to be built up largely from scratch over the last two years. The most helpful thing in this space would be for the coalition to embrace our net zero targets and get behind our Future Made in Australia policies. Perhaps the next leader of the coalition will manage that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nevertheless, industry has already started to pivot its operations, and government leadership has made a difference to this. Centurion, one of the country's biggest transport companies, based in my electorate of Hasluck, is delivering a $29 million project to integrate 30 battery electric trucks to its existing fleet, powered by solar generation and off-grid battery energy storage. Supported by ARENA's investment of $15.8 million, Centurion will install charging equipment, integrated energy generation and storage infrastructure at their Hazelmere depot in Perth, a great example which I'm sure others will follow. Woodside, who I used to work for, has come a long way since I worked there. Woodside has 70 projects afoot to help decarbonise its operations. It has proposed a hydrogen and ammonia plant at Kwinana and is progressing a 50-megawatt solar project near Karratha with battery storage, which will have the capacity to expand to 500 megawatts in the future to meet demand to electrify its gas plant. Rio Tinto and BHP too are moving ahead with battery electric haul truck trials.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the measures delivered in this budget create a positive investment environment and include the establishment of a new front door for investors and streamlining approvals. It brings together our work in both the climate change and industry portfolios, and I hope all support it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282335" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HAINES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:11</span>):  I thank the member for Curtin for this motion. Like her, I too want to see Australia be an abundant source of renewable energy. Making the transition away from fossil fuels towards renewable energy is a non-negotiable for Australia to play its part in reducing the impact of climate change, and I support the shift. But, if Australia wants to increase international competitiveness in decarbonised industries, we must not leave regional communities behind. It is, after all, regional communities, communities in renewable energy zones, who will be home to the batteries, solar, wind and hydro. But, right now, many of these regional communities are feeling like their needs and aspirations are being ignored by international companies seeking to make a profit off Australian resources.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Take the communities of the Strathbogie shire in my electorate, for example. These communities have long-term energy security issues. In fact, many communities in Strathbogie shire experienced up to 11 power outages between November 2023 and February 2024. They're on the edge of the grid, and their energy security is, frankly, appalling. These same communities are at the forefront of a renewable energy project proposal of wind turbines and transmission lines that are being touted as a part of the solution to keeping the nation's lights on—a proposal led by an internationally owned company. But this project, if it goes ahead, won't keep the lights on in Strathbogie. It won't offer any change to the energy security in the towns in which it would exist. So you can understand why communities would have little regard for a proposal which would impact on their beautiful landscape with no change to their energy situation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The shift to renewable energy presents a moment for us—a moment that is as consequential for our nation as the building of the original Snowy Hydro scheme. But right now we're failing to realise this potential for regional Australia. There are communities like Strathbogie right across the nation. Where overseas companies are proposing significant infrastructure changes that would create private profits, these communities are experiencing record housing and childcare shortages, potholed roads and hardly any public transport. Therefore, governments, investors and industry must start joining the dots. If we want to achieve a clean economy, we must show the communities who will get us there what it could look like—what it could look like for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A decarbonised economy can be the next gold rush for regional and rural Australia, but only if we get it right. There are already some good examples of what could happen in regional communities. Golden Plains Wind Farm in Victoria, for example, offsets electricity costs for households that live within three kilometres of a turbine. The Sapphire Wind Farm in New England powers 115,000 homes, has generated 150 jobs and was built with a $7.5 million co-investment raised by local people. These locals are now receiving dividends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These examples should be the norm, not the outliers, so I want to work with government to translate these community aspirations into legislative change. The government have set up the Net Zero Economy Authority as a key step towards ensuring Australia's industries and regions decarbonise and support communities through these changes. But right now that legislation is really only supporting communities transitioning out of fossil fuel industries, not those transitioning into renewable energy generation and storage for the first time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's why I'm seeking to amend the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill, to give communities pathways to negotiate tangible, touchable long-term benefit—things like community benefit plans. Renewable energy companies must listen to and work with communities to identify what they want to see and then put some of their profits back into those regional communities. It could be skilled jobs, childcare services, affordable housing, health services, roads, bridges, telecommunications services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My amendments also allow the authority to set up local energy hubs, trusted shopfronts which facilitate community understanding of what these developers are proposing and why. These trusted, neutral advisers could communicate locally informed expectations to industry about how the community would like to be engaged and how they will see benefit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments offer practical ways to connect the industries who will build the wind turbines, solar panels, hydro facilities and transmission lines for a decarbonised economy and the communities that will inevitably host all of that infrastructure. It is well past time that governments start listening to and supporting all regional communities at the centre of this massive transmission transformation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249710" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:16</span>):  I'm really proud to stand here in this place to talk about decarbonising industries. It's an opportunity for me to share with the Chamber all of the great things that our manufacturers are doing in Bendigo.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bendigo is a region that has a proud manufacturing history. As such, with that proud manufacturing history, our Bendigo Regional Manufacturing Group formed over 30 years ago to talk about energy and energy security. I do acknowledge that that conversation has moulded and shifted in more recent times to talk about how they can be cleaner and greener, so this is an issue that has long been on the radar of my manufacturers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk about decarbonising industries, it's important to talk about where our manufacturers are at. We have a real mix of manufacturing in the Bendigo electorate. We have food manufacturers and we have heavy metal manufacturers. We also have a number of manufacturers in building supplies. But I'll talk briefly about our heavy metal manufacturers and engineering. I acknowledge that Bendigo tends to be known for manufacturing Bushmasters. While we're proud to manufacture the Bushmaster, which saves lives, we are home to a number of other heavy metal manufactures, including Keech Castings and Hoffman Engineering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hoffman Engineering are on track to hit their net zero targets. They are traditionally a manufacturing company that produces the big gears in the big machinery that is required. They are transitioning from being a supplier of this equipment to mining industries to more clean and green industries. And I did want to make this note: if we're going to have a renewable energy industry, which we absolutely need to have, we also need to have the capacity and capability to maintain that renewable energy industry. That is one thing that Hoffman can do. They can refurb, renew, the big gears, the big turbines, that we have popping up all over the country. It is part of that supply chain opportunity that we have. Unfortunately, they still do rely upon gas, because we don't quite yet have the hydrogen technology at the level that it needs to be to transition into manufacturing. But I know that they will welcome it when it does come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth about gas in Victoria is that it sits at about two per cent of our energy make-up. At the moment, it is a little bit of a necessary evil; we have no other choice. If we want Hoffman Engineering to be able to refurb our wind turbines, they need to have gas to keep their temperatures at a certain level to be able to do that, to do the welding that's required and to get the metal to the level of heat that's required. That is why our government's plan to fast-track the development of hydrogen energy is so critical, to give our manufacturers another energy alternative to gas. Just to remind people, that is about two per cent of our overall energy mix.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another manufacturer doing amazing things when it comes to renewable energy is Australian Turntables. They are actively involved in securing and decarbonising and are on their path to net zero. One of the previous speakers talked about mining, and I want to give a shout-out to Fosterville Gold Mine. They've bought electric vehicles. In fact, the Minister for Climate Change and Energy, Chris Bowen, was there on the very first day that one of the diggers was going underground. However, again, this comes back to how we are transitioning the grid. Unfortunately, we don't have the energy requirement yet for the mine to go entirely electric vehicle, which is something that they're working closely with Powercor to do and with localised landholders to do in building the solar farms to generate the energy so that they can be one of our first mines in this country, a gold mine, to go net zero. They're on track to meet their target and beat their target by 2050.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our food manufacturing sector, too, is adapting to renewable energy and going towards that decarbonised focus. Solar panels are a big part of their solution. I can remember, and this goes back to when Julia Gillard was Prime Minister, the clean energy grants. One of our particular manufacturers had the biggest solar system in the state of Victoria. Not today. But we have been early adopters of this kind of technology. We must have industries that decarbonise, and I know that they're up for it. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is fortunate to have a largely universal healthcare system that seeks to improve the health and wellbeing of all Australians. Only Labor understands that. After 10 years of coalition government, we saw: our hospitals under incredible stress; people unable to get in to see a GP; people unable to afford to see a GP; and the costs of seeing specialists becoming unaffordable for many people. Unfortunately, I've seen it all before.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I started my private practice in 1984, it was the beginning of Medicare. But people had forgotten that Medibank, introduced by Gough Whitlam, was the initial iteration of our universal healthcare scheme that was destroyed by the Fraser government. We then saw the introduction of Medicare, but, with the election of the Abbott government, look what happened! We had Peter Dutton, the present Leader of the Opposition, as health minister, trying to introduce Medicare co-payments, trying to make people pay to be seen in the public hospital system, making health care more and more unaffordable for average Australians. This was terrible and this was one of the reasons that spurred me to run in 2016. I was sick and tired of writing to ministers and departments regarding issues affecting my patients. We saw people who had kids with asthma not being able to afford their preventer medications, causing them to end up in hospital. We saw people with heart failure not being able to afford their medications, medications becoming more and more unaffordable. I think that there's something wrong with the timer, Deputy Speaker.</span>

                  </a>  Well, I need a lot of time to talk about the deficiencies of the coalition government in health care. I was very fortunate to be elected in 2016. I sought meetings with many ministers—including the present Deputy Leader of the Opposition, when she was health minister, and later the member for Flinders, when he was health minister—trying to get them to understand that people could not afford to get primary care and the difficulties people were facing as to getting in to see GPs. Unfortunately, they both sat on their hands and did nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thankfully, change has been occurring following the 2022 federal election. I'm very proud to be able to work with the Prime Minister, the Minister for Health and Aged Care and the health team, including the member for Dobell and Ged Kearney, the Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care, on women's health, on getting reform—on getting change to happen. And, at long last, people are now able to access health care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're seeing the opening of our urgent care centres. It was great to be at the opening of the urgent care centre in Campbelltown, which is really enabling people to bypass the hospital emergency department and get great care; that's taking a lot of pressure off our hospital system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of our first items of business in 2022 was to make medicines cheaper. That has delivered the largest price reduction in the 75-year history of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme—another Labor scheme. Under our government, people will pay no more than $31.60 for medicines on the PBS, and they'll be much cheaper if someone is on a healthcare card. Sixty-day prescribing has made a huge difference, and that is another way that people can get cheaper and more affordable health care. I'm proud of our government for fighting hard for this reform—and fighting the vested interests that tried to oppose it—which means cheaper medicines for all Australians. We've been working hard to strengthen Medicare, through our historic investment in the Strengthening Medicare program; the bulk-billing incentives, which have tripled the rebates for people who are bulk-billed and will benefit almost 11 million people; and improving bulk-billing rates around the country, making GP practice more viable and allowing people to access GPs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's still a lot of work to be done, but, after 10 years of neglect by the coalition government, we're rapidly catching up with health care. We're making significant investments in medical and health research, with $1.4 billion to be invested over 13 years through the Medical Research Future Fund, including an additional $411 million for low-survival cancers and also to reduce health inequities. We're investing $18.8 million to make Australia a destination for clinical trials. This is really important in the medical research fund. We're doing our best to strengthen Medicare— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, we're clearly in desperate need of improvements, given the way that flu, RSV and COVID are currently sweeping across the nation and overwhelming the public health system. Elective surgeries have been cancelled under South Australia's emergency 'code yellow', with plans to transfer some patients from overwhelmed Adelaide metropolitan hospitals to regional centres—in large part because frontline workers are sick. But how can that be, if they're all vaccinated? Clearly I do not understand how vaccinations work.</span>

Chris is so desperate that he's given me permission to use his full name. Chris was diagnosed with a COVID vaccine injury called chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, which resulted from his first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine.

Working with a lawyer, because the system is so difficult to navigate, Chris compiled a thousand-page submission, which he submitted to Services Australia on 2 March 2023. That's 459 days ago. In those 459 days, his application passed the initial review stage and then also passed the external medical review done by the TGA on the first try. After passing the external medical review, he was asked three times for additional information, and his application then went through another external legal panel review and an internal legal review. The most recent external legal review was completed on 23 May, and the advice was passed to Services Australia on that day. Last Thursday, day 455, Services Australia advised that they cannot offer any further update—nothing—no indication of what the advice from the external legal panel was, no indication of the next step and no indication of when they will be able to provide any further update. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The scheme was supposed to be an easy-to-access safety net, with quick administrative processes. These were the words of Greg Hunt, then health minister, when he announced the scheme. The government knew there would be vaccine injuries, but this cautionary initiative was drowned out by the fear propaganda machine and the 'safe and effective' mantra. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Chris is an innocent victim of a bureaucratic nightmare. In Chris's words:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">the vaccine injuries scheme is administered <span style="font-weight:bold;">with cruelty and callous disregard</span> for the human beings who have been injured by these vaccines that were taken in good faith when asked by our government to do so </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Chris told me he speaks with other people facing the same challenges with the scheme and its administration. Are we seeing another robodebt? Will it take a suicide to draw attention to this horrendous situation? Dare I say that the vaccine compensation scheme looks to have similar hallmarks to the robodebt scheme, which was referred to as a 'crude and cruel' mechanism. Haven't we learned anything as a parliament of people? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Chris hasn't been able to work since September 2021 and has not had any income since April 2022. While he did receive a modest TPD payment from his superannuation, it's money that diminishes with every passing day. Chris called me last Friday at his wit's end. He is a strong, capable and professional man who has been pushed to the brink, and he's not the only one. He said he's at the edge of his ability to cope with the additional harm that this claim scheme is inflicting upon him every day. Chris's situation is a shameful blight on our nation—one that has not reached its zenith.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:32</span>):  I congratulate the member for Macarthur for moving this very important motion. As we all know, the member for Macarthur is a medical practitioner and paediatrician, and what he said in his speech is absolutely correct. It is evident that only a government led by Labor can be relied upon to prioritise and reinforce Medicare and ensure the safety of Medicare for the public. Only under a Labor administration will the pricing of essential medications remain stable. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our commitment extends beyond mere rhetoric. We genuinely care about the health and accessibility of our healthcare system for all Australians—an Australia where your Medicare card counts and not your credit card. Our health minister wouldn't even consider taxing visits to the doctor, as we saw done by the previous health minister in the previous government, but that's exactly what the opposition leader was pushing for when he was minister. The proposal to slash $50 billion from Australian hospitals as advocated by the opposition leader defies common sense. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this Albanese Labor government, we've rolled out 87 Medicare urgent care clinics, including five in South Australia at Elizabeth, Marion, Morphett Vale, the western region of Royal Park, near my electorate, and Mount Gambier. Of course, many people are accessing these urgent care clinics, including those from my electorate at the one in the western region of Royal Park. The difference they've made is absolutely remarkable. It's evident that Australia benefits immensely from having more urgent Medicare clinics available, and expanding access to these urgent care centres improves our healthcare system for everyone. Of course, we'll continue to advocate for the possibility of extending this benefit to communities in the Adelaide electorate as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned earlier, this government places a high priority on ensuring that people have access to the help and support that they need, including essential healthcare services and products. That's why we've also taken steps to expand the availability of free mental health services. We understand that mental health is a significant issue that can have a profound impact on individual lives. Our goal is to improve people's wellbeing and provide them with the support that they need to overcome mental health challenges, rather than limiting their options for treatment and recovery. We're ensuring that Australians can afford the medication and treatment that they require and are making sure it is a key priority for us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's concerning to think that anyone in Adelaide or elsewhere might feel unable to book a doctor's appointment or follow their prescribed medication regimen due to financial constraints. That's why we're working very hard to address these concerns. Our Minister for Health and Aged Care is actively working to ensure that more Australians don't have to face these tough choices, and I congratulate the member for Hindmarsh, the minister, for the absolutely brilliant work that he's done in this area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're increasing the availability of healthcare services in areas where there is a shortage and making medicines more affordable by reducing patient costs and improving access to them, as we've seen. One way we're doing this is by listing new medicines on the PBS. This initiative will help to ease the financial burden on Australians and ensure that they can access the medications that they need to stay healthy. All of these efforts are driven by our genuine concern for the wellbeing of every Australian. We care deeply about ensuring that everyone has access to the health care that they need, regardless of their financial circumstances and regardless of their credit card. The only card that should count is the Medicare card that all Australians have access to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is unlike the previous government. When they came into government in 2013, the health minister came in and chopped and changed the entire system. They took billions out of the healthcare service. That's why we need to restore that money and restore the services that we've always taken pride in as a nation: our Medicare system. It is so important that everyone has access to a doctor when they need one, and they will have access under this government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300147" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VIOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:37</span>):  Whilst speaking on health, it's very important that I raise the situation of one of my local constituents, Michael, who's 35 and from Lilydale. Michael was a self-employed electrician who, in the height of Victoria's pandemic lockdowns, was required to get vaccinated due to his job requirements to enter people's homes. After consultation with his doctor, it was decided that it was safe for Michael to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine. Tragically, this resulted in permanent life-altering myocarditis and pericarditis, which have been diagnosed by Michael's specialist. This has taken Michael's ability to work, causing significant financial difficulties, instability and great anxiety about what the future holds. Why is it the case that those who received the AstraZeneca vaccine continue to be barred from accessing compensation under the COVID-19 Vaccine Claims Scheme? I've met with Michael, and I've made representations to the minister about his case. When you see how this situation has had a devastating impact on Michael and his family, you know there is more that we need to do. It's time that the government look to support those with vaccine injuries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we look at motions by those opposite, the wording is always very careful and you've got to look at the detail. They talk a big game on Medicare and on health, but, when you look at this motion, there's something that's very important to our health system that's not referenced: bulk-billing. Bulk-billing is not referenced at all in this motion. The reason is that bulk-billing is down 11 per cent since this government came to power, four per cent in the last 12 months. They talk about health, but the numbers show that they're not delivering when it comes to the health system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They're talking also about the Medicare urgent care clinics which appear to be making a difference. I know that, in my community of Casey, which covers 2½ thousand square kilometres, we don't have a hospital and we don't have an emergency department. We've only got seven bulk-billing clinics in our community, and we need a Medicare urgent care clinic so that my community can have access to the health care that they deserve. It's why we've been running a campaign with a petition calling on the government to not play politics, but to deliver for communities. Twenty-nine new clinics were announced in the last budget, but the government haven't announced the locations. I do note they've announced a few locations and, miraculously, all those locations seem to be in Labor held seats. So I'll be watching with interest to see the rest of those 29 Medicare urgent care clinics delivered. It will be a test of whether this government is genuine about the health care of everyone in the community or just those in Labor-held seats.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also interesting that, in this motion, those opposite talk about expanding free mental health services. They didn't do that in my community. This government closed down and pulled the funding for the Lilydale Youth Hub—an investment from the former coalition government to help young people with a drop-in centre and by giving them the mental health services and supports they needed. Despite it delivering significant results and benefits for our community and despite a community campaign, the Albanese Labor government ripped that funding and ripped that youth hub from our community. So it's pretty galling when they talk about expanding mental health services. It's not just Casey that has been abandoned when it comes to mental health services. This government cut the number of free Medicare mental health services from 20 sessions to 10 sessions—they cut the number half. The member for Macnamara had the courage to come out and criticise the government for that decision, and I commend him for that. They cut the number in half despite the Better Health Initiative report finding that it should stay at 20. The sessions were expanded from 10 to 20 under the coalition during COVID. This government made the heartless decision to cut the number in half. If you need help and if you need mental health support, you get 10 sessions; you don't get the 20 sessions that you need, unless you've got the money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They talk a big game on health and mental health, but the reality and the facts show that they are abandoning the people of Casey and the nation when it comes to health.</span>

                  <a href="299174" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAXALE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:43</span>):  I'd like to thank the member for Macarthur for the opportunity to talk about how Labor was elected to strengthen Medicare and how the most recent budget continues on with our election commitments. We know that only Labor can strengthen Medicare. Labor created Medicare. We'll protect Medicare, and we'll strengthen it. With the 2024 budget, we are taking further steps to reverse the cuts and neglect of the Liberals by enhancing the accessibility, affordability and quality of healthcare services nationwide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very happy to be able to say that the government will significantly strengthen Medicare in Bennelong. From 1 July, Bennelong will get its first federally funded Medicare urgent care clinic at Top Ryde shopping centre. It will be open for seven days a week for longer hours, be fully bulk-billed and accept walk-in patients. No matter who you are, what you do or what you earn, you'll have access to the Top Ryde Medicare urgent care clinic, and that access will be fully bulk-billed with no out-of-pocket costs because Labor believes that, to get urgent care, all you should need is your Medicare card, not your credit card. Funded in the budget, the Top Ryde Medicare urgent care clinic is an upgrade on the NSW Health run clinic. From 1 July, it will operate as a federally funded clinic, and it will help significantly alleviate the pressure on the Ryde Hospital Emergency Department.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last financial year, almost half of all the presentations at Ryde Hospital were for conditions that could have been managed in a less acute setting. By shifting these cases to the Top Ryde Medicare urgent care clinic, patients will be seen more quickly and emergency departments will be reserved for the most critical of cases. The $227 million expansion of the Medicare urgent care clinic program announced in the budget will establish another 29 clinics across the country, bringing the total number of Medicare urgent care clinics to 87, and the impact of these clinics in communities is already evident.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the first sites opened in June 2023, the 58 existing Medicare urgent care clinics across Australia have handled over 400,000 presentations. In New South Wales alone, the 14 existing clinics have seen more than 65,000 visits, and Bennelong will get its own federally funded urgent care clinic in a few weeks time. It doesn't end there. From 1 July 2025, Bennelong will get its first public MRI licence as part of a $70 million program to increase the number of public MRI machines. Currently, local residents don't have local access to fully funded, Medicare billed MRIs. Our closest public machines are at Royal North Shore or Westmead. Locals had a choice of either being hundreds of dollars out of pocket or travelling out of the area to get important MRI images.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This expansion from 1 July 2025 will profoundly impact the accessibility of MRI services for everyone in Bennelong. It will mean that the current MRI machine at Macquarie University Hospital will shift from a private licence to a public one. It will help patients access affordable and world-class health care right at our doorstep. And, with more public machines available, patients will experience shorter wait times and quicker, cheaper access to essential imaging services. These machines are crucial for early detection and treatment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since we were elected, we have remained committed to strengthening the healthcare system and providing tangible relief from cost-of-living pressures. Tripling the bulk-billing rate, making medicines cheaper and funding urgent care clinics and MRIs, we are a government that are undoing the cuts and chaos of the Liberals and Nationals. Contrast our record with that of the former government. We know that, when Mr Dutton was health minister, the Liberals' Leader of the Opposition froze the Medicare rebate, a freeze that remained in place for six long years. He froze it; we tripled it. The Liberals' Leader of the Opposition also cut $200 million from the system aimed specifically at reducing demand on state-run emergency departments. He put pressure on these departments; we're opening urgent care clinics to take pressure off. Under the Liberals, the Leader of the Opposition tried to jack up the price of medicine by adding $5 to every script. He wanted to push up the cost of medicines, and we have cut them, saving locals in Bennelong almost $2.5 million in two years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The difference couldn't be more stark. The Liberals opposed, froze and sought to attack Medicare. Under Labor, we'll continue to strengthen it.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:47</span>):  Indeed, the difference could not be more stark. Under the previous government, we achieved more than 94 million telehealth consultations through Medicare to 16 million patients. There have been 857 new medicines listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme since 2019 alone. More than 128,000 Australians were supported by headspace each year, and there were 1,400 additional nurse placements for the regions. The regions are where I want to very much concentrate on with my contribution because it's the regions which have been left behind by this Albanese Labor government when it comes to health care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bulk-billing has collapsed since Labor came into government. The government is overseeing the worst bulk-billing rate in a decade after it was at an all-time high of 88.8 per cent under the Liberals and Nationals. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners health of the nation report showed that the number of GPs who bulk-billed all their patients halved in just 12 months, while the cost of seeing a GP increased by $11 on average. We have a city-centric health minister who, when questioned about bulk-billing, said, 'Well, if you don't get a doctor who wants to bulk-bill, put the phone down and ring another doctor.' Well that might all be well and good in the leafy suburbs of Adelaide, where the health minister comes from, but, when you're in Parkes or Forbes or Junee or Cowra or Gundagai or many of those other vibrant regional towns, it is difficult to find a doctor let alone another doctor who might bulk-bill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, I am very disappointed that the federal Labor government changed the distribution priority areas for GPs to include some of the outer suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne, as well as Newcastle, Wollongong, the Gold Coast and other major centres. What that did is it told a budding new GP or somebody who had already been operating in a regional centre that they could go and hang their shingle in one of those, some might say, more desirable areas, and that left, and is leaving, country centres high and dry. Indeed, many of them are overworked because of the work that they have to do, which they do lovingly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why I was so pleased, when I was the Deputy Prime Minister, that I was able to get the Murray-Darling Medical Schools Network up and running and funded. Its footprint extends into Wagga Wagga, Dubbo, Orange—I see the member for Calare sitting behind me; they've certainly benefited in his electorate—Bendigo, Mildura and Albury-Wodonga. All of those centres are now training young doctors from start to finish. They're doing their entire medical degree in a regional centre. The Orange medical school was opened on 4 March 2022. What it means for that one and the one at Wagga Wagga is that hopefully the young budding doctors will not only fall in love with the region but might even fall in love with somebody in the region and stay in the region. It's proof positive that, if people do a regional course and get a diploma from a regional university, generally speaking, three-quarters of those people stay in the regions, live in the regions, operate in the regions and make the regions their homes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you've got a health minister who then says, 'If you don't get what you like when you pick the phone up, hang it up and ring the next doctor,' it goes to show how out of touch he is with the dilemma that is in regional Australia at the moment. The Mayor of Parkes, Neil Westcott, told me recently there hasn't been a baby born at Parkes hospital for five years. The health minister, if you asked him, would say, 'They can go down the road 40 kilometres to Forbes and have their baby there,' but it's not the same thing. Why shouldn't a community of 12,000 people have its own obstetrics services—its own maternity services—at its own hospital?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's just not right, and it's not right because we've got this distribution priority areas change. It's not right because we've got a city-centric health minister and a city-centric government not looking after the health needs, the Medicare needs and the bulk-billing needs of people who choose to live in the regions. The regions are the best place in the world in which to live, but this government has to do a lot more to improve the health services therein.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to express my support for the right to self-determination of the Armenian people in Nagorno-Karabakh and the Republic of Artsakh. I condemn the unconscionable attack by Azerbaijan in September 2023, which has caused untold misery and has driven almost all Armenians who formerly lived in Nagorno-Karabakh from their homes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Azerbaijan's military actions in September 2023 were devastating for the residents of Nagorno-Karabakh, who had already endured a 10-month blockade of the Lachin corridor. Civilians living in Nagorno-Karabakh were forced to endure violence as well as desperate shortages of food, power and medical supplies. The toll on Australians of Armenian heritage, including many in my electorate of Bradfield, and on those concerned for family members and other loved ones in Nagorno-Karabakh was enormous and remains ongoing to this day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <span class="HPS-Small">… impeded the transfer of persons of Armenian national or ethnic origin hospitalized in Nagorno-Karabakh to medical facilities in Armenia for urgent medical care. There have also been hindrances to the importation into Nagorno-Karabakh of essential goods, causing shortages of food, medicine and other life-saving medical supplies.</span>
              </p>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has consistently called for Azerbaijan to reopen the corridor, for the International Court of Justice orders to be honoured, and for the disputes to be resolved peacefully and in ways that protect the civilians in Nagorno-Karabakh. Despite this, the Albanese Labor government disappointingly, very disappointingly, failed to join with allies in publicly stating Australia's opposition to the blockade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Azerbaijan's attack of September 2023 drove more than 100,000 of the 120,000 Armenian inhabitants of Nagorno-Karabakh out of their homes and communities. At the time of the attack, the coalition called for Azerbaijan to cease hostilities as well as to protect the rights and culture of residents of Armenian heritage. We called for Azerbaijan to allow an independent international observer mission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition welcomed the Australian government's commitment of $500,000 to the United Nations's refugee agency, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, to alleviate the suffering of Armenians who fled Nagorno-Karabakh. Coalition parliamentarians, or their officers, spoke directly with representatives of the Australian Armenian community who were on the ground assisting refugees from Nagorno-Karabakh who were arriving in Armenia, seeking food, shelter and medical supplies. These Australians, members of the Armenian National Committee of Australia and other volunteers, reinforced to us the urgent need for humanitarian support for the civilians who had been displaced from Nagorno-Karabakh and the role the International Committee of the Red Cross played as one of the very few international aid agencies on the ground in Armenia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Based on that direct feedback, the coalition called on the Albanese Labor government to make an urgent financial commitment from Australia to the International Committee of the Red Cross in Armenia to support the wellbeing of those fleeing from Nagorno-Karabakh. We also offered our bipartisan support for the Australian government to publicly state its support for the proposed international observer mission and to provide such expertise as Australia is able to offer based upon our nation's experience in supporting responses to international humanitarian emergencies. We welcome the fact that Australia joined the joint statement on the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh at the United Nations Human Rights Council in October last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition supports the ongoing efforts by the international community to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the territorial disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Australia's major parties are bipartisan in our support for Armenia and Azerbaijan reaching agreement that guarantees the rights and security of the peoples in Nagorno-Karabakh and in recognising the sovereignty and territorial integrity of both Armenia and Azerbaijan. I therefore very much commend this motion to the House. I call upon the Australian government to take a clear and firm stance to call for the removal of Azerbaijani troops from the sovereign borders of Armenia, for the right of return of Armenians to Artsakh and for the release of all Armenian prisoners, and for Azerbaijan to cease its erasure of the Armenian presence in the region.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:58</span>):  I second the motion. On 19 September 2023, Azerbaijani forces conducted an unprovoked military assault on Artsakh. This attack precipitated a crisis and the forcible displacement of an estimated 100,000 indigenous Armenians from their ancestral homeland. Prior to this September assault, Azerbaijani forces blocked the highway connecting the republic of Artsakh and Armenia. This deliberate action left 120,000 people trapped without secure access to essential supplies, including food, energy and medical resources. The tactics employed by Azerbaijani authorities in implementing and maintaining this blockade created untenable living circumstances for months. This blockade was deliberate, and then it created a crisis—a crisis that lasted for 281 days leading to Azerbaijan's two-day offensive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite a clear violation of the 2020 ceasefire agreement between both countries, Azerbaijan launched a large-scale offensive against Artsakh. Azerbaijan claimed its operations were not targeting civilian positions, but witnesses painted a different picture. Strikes were reported close to large cities and densely populated areas, raising significant concerns about the safety and wellbeing of the civilian population. By the end of those two fateful days, Artsakh reported that 27 people had lost their lives and more than 200 individuals were injured. This conflict led to further turmoil, as authorities evacuated over 7,000 people from settlements. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When fighting ended, Azerbaijan opened the border for the first time in months, and, in fear of retribution at the hands of aggressors, an estimated 100,000 indigenous Armenians fled. They had no option but to leave and were forced to flee their homes for fear of death. As thousands fled Artsakh to escape the threats, a catastrophic explosion at a fuel storage facility resulted in the loss of at least 170 lives, with more than 290 people injured. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Armenian people have endured so much. The blockade followed by the assault have deeply concerned human rights organisations and experts in genocide prevention. Alarming alerts have been issued, indicating that the ethnic Armenian population in Artsakh is at significant risk of genocide. These risks cannot be ignored by the world, because Armenia has been through this before. For many Armenians, witnessing the unrest in the Artsakh region has brought home horrendous memories, reopening deep wounds and igniting a sense of collective trauma that has persisted since the Armenian genocide of April 1915. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are around 50,000 Australian Armenians, most of whom live in my electorate of Bennelong. Our Armenian Australian community makes Bennelong a better place to live. I'm proud to have a strong history of standing beside them in their ongoing fight for recognition and justice. In my former role as councillor and mayor of the City of Ryde and now as a chair of the parliamentary friends of Armenia group, I've actively worked alongside the Armenian National Committee and local Australian Armenians to ensure that their plight is recognised and addressed. I have called for government recognition of the genocide in the past and will continue to do so. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the wake of the recent crisis, I've been one of many from all sides of politics to have raised the blockade and the two-day assault with government. In response, the government have condemned the brutal assault on Artsakh by Azerbaijan and, in recognising the severe humanitarian crisis resulting from this aggression, have taken concrete steps to provide immediate assistance and support to those affected. Bipartisan calls for allocating humanitarian aid were heard, and in response the government allocated half a million dollars in humanitarian aid to the UNHCR. This funding has supported emergency relief efforts by providing essential supplies to the displaced Armenian population. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a lot going on in the world right now. As the representative of the largest Armenian Australian community in Australia, it's important that their voices remain heard and that these issues remain well known to the government. I see that as my most important role, and I'll continue to raise the ongoing situation in Artsakh and Nagorno-Karabakh within government for as long as is needed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The actions of Azerbaijan are ongoing, senseless and unprovoked. They have caused and continue to cause immense suffering and displacement. They need to know that the world is watching. Political prisoners need to be released, internationally recognised borders must be respected and ancient cultural sites must be preserved. These are not unreasonable asks. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:03</span>):  On 27 March last year, I rose in this place to discuss the situation in the Artsakh region of Armenia. I rise today on the same topic in support of the member for Bradfield's motion and to thank him for bringing this issue to the parliament again. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Artsakh was an unrecognised self-governed Armenian region after holding a democratic referendum following the breakdown of the Soviet Union. In that referendum, 99.81 per cent of the population voted for independence from Azerbaijan. There has been ongoing conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia ever since.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In September 2020, Azerbaijan re-established control over much of Artsakh's territory during a 44-day military assault. The Armenian controlled territory in Artsakh shrank to the local capital area and only some parts of the region surrounding it. Its population consisted of an estimated 120,000 ethnic Armenians, who were promised access to Armenia via a single route, the so-called Lachin corridor. On 12 December 2022, Azerbaijan blockaded the Lachin corridor, the road that connects the republic of Artsakh to the Republic of Armenia. Essential supplies of food, water and medicine were blocked. In February 2023, the International Court of Justice ordered provisional measures to ensure that Azerbaijan end the blockade of the Lachin corridor. The order, which has a binding effect, states:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Republic of Azerbaijan shall … take all measures at its disposal to ensure unimpeded movement of persons, vehicles and cargo along the Lachin Corridor in both directions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tragically, not only has that order not been followed by Azerbaijan but, in September 2023, Azerbaijan launched a large-scale military offensive against the self-declared breakaway state of Artsakh. This offensive resulted in nearly the entire population of Artsakh fleeing their homeland for neighbouring countries. Human rights organisations and experts in genocide prevention warned that the region's Armenian population was at risk of being subjected to ethnic cleansing and genocide, as well as war crimes and crimes against humanity. The inaugural prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has labelled the ethnic cleansing of the Artsakh Armenians as the second Armenian genocide, encouraged by the inaction of the international community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a wonderful and vibrant Armenian community in my electorate of Mackellar, where the bilingual Armenian-English AGBU Alexander Primary School is also located. I have had representations from many in their community, including from students from this school. On their behalf, I have in turn made representations to the foreign minister's office about the ongoing crisis and met with foreign affairs department specialists to discuss the matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At this time of increasing geopolitical uncertainty, it is important we keep a close eye on the situation in the republic of Artsakh, listen to the international observer groups and provide the Mackellar Armenian community and the rest of the Armenian community inside Australia with as much support and information as possible. There is so much brutality in the world right now. Between Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the military action in Gaza, there is much to distract us from the pain and loss being suffered by the people of Armenia and Artsakh. But we cannot and must not look away.</span>

Known by Armenians as Artsakh, or Black Garden, the enclave Armenian population within Azerbaijani territory was subjected to a devastating months-long blockade that prevented food and medical supplies reaching its 120,000 residents, followed by an unprovoked 24-hour military assault by Azerbaijani forces. Azerbaijani authorities have internationally recognised sovereignty over these territories and exercise control over the territory from which the blockade was being carried out. However, they wilfully ignored their obligation to ensure that the population in Nagorno-Karabakh was not denied access to food and other essential goods and medications. With social media bringing the footage of these brutal engagements to the phone screens of Armenians across the world, community members in Australia were more exposed to the conflict than ever before, and the despair and grief in their committees has been heard by this parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to note that for the second time now an Australian government has recognised Azerbaijan's belligerent actions—firstly, in November 2022, acknowledging Azerbaijan as the responsible party for a specific series of crimes against Armenian prisoners of war and the desecration of Armenian cultural and religious sites; and, secondly, acknowledging Azerbaijan as the instigator of legal blockade in violation of international law. The Australian government provided half a million dollars to the United Nations refugee agency to alleviate the suffering of Armenians who fled the region following Azerbaijan's military escalation. During the blockade, the Australian government was concerned by the humanitarian situation and the welfare of more than 100,000 people from Nagorno-Karabakh now in Armenia. Australia's contribution helped provide shelter and supplies to refugees and host communities. In August last year, we joined with the United States of America, Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Parliament and many other nations and prominent non-governmental organisations in supporting the provisional measures of the International Court of Justice when the court ordered Azerbaijan to take all measures at its disposal to ensure unimpeded movement of persons, vehicles and cargo along the Lachin corridor in both directions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 11 October 2023, Australia joined the Joint Statement on the Situation in Nagorno-Karabakh at the 54th session of the Human Rights Council, supporting the rights and security of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians. Finally, in November last year, at the UN during the Universal Periodic Review of Azerbaijan, the Australian government recommended that Azerbaijan (1) immediately investigate allegations of illegal killings and torture by Azerbaijani soldiers during the 2020 war with Armenia and during fighting in September 2022, (2) cease arbitrary arrests of those critical of the government and release those held on politically motivated charges, and (3) investigate allegations of ill-treatment within the Azerbaijani criminal justice system and hold perpetrators to account.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has been clear that we expect Azerbaijan should guarantee the rights and security of the inhabitants of Nagorno-Karabakh and release all illegally detained Armenian political prisoners, particularly civilians. Australia calls on Azerbaijan to take steps to ensure the protection of ancient cultural and historical sites. We support mediation efforts to secure a just and lasting peace. A peace agreement should recognise the sovereignty and territorial integrity of both Armenia and Azerbaijan and uphold the rights and security of Armenians who have remained in Nagorno-Karabakh, as well as those who may wish to return in the future. Australia welcomed the 7 December 2023 statement from the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan, reaffirming their intention to negotiate a peace treaty. We are encouraged by recent progress, including Armenia and Azerbaijan agreeing to use the 1991 Alma-Ata declaration as the basis for border delimitation. Australia believes a future peace agreement should recognise the sovereignty and territorial integrity of both countries and uphold the rights and security of Armenians who have remained in Nagorno-Karabakh, as well as those who may wish to return in the future.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2022, the Minister for Education, Jason Clare, embarked on a generational review of the higher education sector. The Australian Universities Accord consulted with students, industry, universities and staff in the sector to create a plan for the future. Currently only 14.7 per cent of higher education enrolments in Victoria are from low-SES postcodes, out of 24.9 per cent of the total population. This reveals that the low-SES students in Victoria have nearly half the enrolment rate of their wealthy peers. For an electorate like Holt, higher education is meant to be a pathway—a ladder to a better life—but the current system means that so many students miss out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The accord has set an ambitious target to have 80 per cent of the workforce achieve a tertiary qualification by 2050. To achieve this, the accord made 47 recommendations to make higher education better and fairer for students and to expand access to those from disadvantaged backgrounds and those from the outer suburbs. If the goals of the accord can be achieved, $240 billion will be added to the economy over the next 25 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2024-25 federal budget, the government responded to 29 of the Australian Universities Accord's recommendations. Firstly, the government is changing the way indexation is calculated, wiping around $3 billion in student debt for more than three million Australians. We recognise that the recent debt rises threaten to discourage young Australians from studying. That is why Labor is changing the indexation of loans so that student loans will never increase faster than their wages. We are introducing the Commonwealth prac payment for teaching, nursing, midwifery and social work students who are undertaking mandatory placements. From July 2025, these students will be paid $319.50 per week while undertaking their placements so that students do not need to live in poverty while training to be our essential workers. To expand access and provide alternative pathways for disadvantaged students in communities like Holt, we are investing $350 million in FEE-FREE Uni Ready courses. Initiatives like these are crucial for bridging the gap in education and ensuring equal opportunities for all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the common themes from students and academics in the Universities Accord was the issue of accountability. To quote from the National Union of Students submission:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Students are the largest stakeholder in the higher education sector and their voice is essential for a well-run system. At the moment students do not feel like their voice is being heard and universities have a reputation of being billion-dollar unaccountable institutions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Universities Accord proposed new mechanisms for accountability, including the establishment of an independent national student ombudsman. The ombudsman will allow all students to escalate complaints about the actions of their higher education provider, including complaints about sexual harassment, assaults and violence. It will have the power to make recommendations to providers about actions that should be taken to resolve a complaint and work with regulators to respond to systemic issues. These issues are well known because of the advocacy of the students, led by the work of the National Union of Students and campus based student unions. That is why the government is mandating that higher education providers allocate at least 40 per cent of the student services and amenities fees to student led organisations. This will strengthen student led organisations and their ability to act for the best interests of the students they are elected to serve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are not done with our work to improve access to higher education. Whether a kid is from Toorak or Croydon, Carlton or Cranbourne, all Australians deserve the same opportunities. The Albanese Labor government is committed to ensuring that all Australians can aspire to study at university. I commend this motion to the House.</span>

                  <a href="008CH" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms DANIEL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:18</span>):  I thank the member for Holt for this motion on the Australian Universities Accord. Young people are under pressure in ways that most of us were not at that age. They're living with instability, insecurity and uncertainty that, if not unprecedented, has certainly not been seen in the years since HECS was introduced more than three decades ago. Employment is much less secure than it was then, and there's no certainty that a university degree will reward a graduate with higher income than someone without tertiary qualifications.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of all that, young people are living amid a once-in-a-generation cost-of-living crisis. Rents have reached a record high, with the median weekly rent in Australia now at $627, which is 8.5 per cent higher than at this time last year. The days when it was relatively easy to find an affordable share house are over, as are the days when students could be sure their pay in part-time jobs would keep pace with inflation. In real terms, although wages have recently finally grown slightly, the average wage is now the same as in 2011. Meanwhile, the escalation in tuition fees means that graduates have much higher HECS debts in real terms than even a decade ago and much more than when the system was introduced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Taxation Office data compiled by the Australia Institute shows that Australians in their 20s with a HECS-HELP debt in 2005-06 had an average debt of around $12,500. From then until June 2023, total inflation was 57 per cent. Had the average size of debt increased in line with inflation, the average 2022-23 HECS-HELP debt held by people in their 20s should have been around $19,500. Instead, according to the Australia Institute, the average debt had risen by 145 per cent and was $30,763. That doesn't consider the Morrison government's ineffective and punitive Job-ready Graduates Package, which saw the cost of a communications degree, for example, rise from around $20,400 to $43,500.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was early in 2023, before that year's federal budget, that I called on the Minister for Education to recognise the difficulties high inflation was creating for students and recent graduates by reforming the indexation formula for HECS-HELP debts. I suggested then that the formula should be determined based on whatever was lower: the consumer price index or the wage price index. Although it took a year, the minister added it to the work program for the Universities Accord review, which accepted and recommended the change in this year's budget, helped along by a massive petition launched by the member of Kooyong. The government announcement—by backdating the change to last year, when HECS indexation was pledged to an inflation figure of 7.1 per cent—is wiping out around $3 billion in student debt for more than three million Australians. Those with an average debt will see their liability cut by $1,200.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is more that the government should be doing. It should be altering the timing of indexation until after compulsory repayments made over the year have been calculated, rather than before, a step that would save debtors hundreds of dollars annually. One option would be to move the indexation date from late in the tax year until after the tax return due date of 31 October. I do welcome the fact that the minister has approached banks to encourage them not to consider HECS-HELP debt when calculating eligibility for a home loan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spent much of this speech talking about HECS because we need to resolve these issues to enable young people to reach their full potential. If 80 per cent of the workforce will need a tertiary qualification by 2050, we must remove the roadblocks to study. Sorting out HECS and HELP is a critical piece of this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, I also raised the issue of sexual assault on campus with the minister, pointing out the horrendous statistic that one in 20 students had been sexually assaulted since starting uni. I and other members of the crossbench introduced the minister to students from Fair Agenda who have been advocating for years for an ombudsman to tackle gender based violence at universities. This is also being delivered, and I'm very pleased that the minister has done so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is much more that I could say about the Universities Accord, but, given the available time, I will conclude by saying this: it is encouraging to see a report that provides an ambitious vision for tertiary education to underpin the future of our nation. Properly intersected university and vocational education is key to this, because education is power for individuals and for societies, including Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="132880" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr MULINO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:23</span>):  Education policy is central to any federal government—education at all levels: high school, vocational education and training and TAFE, and higher education. Today we focus on higher education. It is only one part of education, but it is a central part of education policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, while higher education policy is a story of individuals and their dreams and aspirations to fulfil their career opportunities, it's also a story about the macroeconomy and about society as a whole. In that sense, higher education policy is both a story of equity and access and a policy that relates to participation and our investment in human capital. These are interrelated because if we wish to achieve higher rates of participation and higher rates of investment in education then we, as a society, need to do better in giving those from more disadvantaged backgrounds a realistic chance of fulfilling their dreams. So we need to achieve both equity and access and, at the same time, higher rates of participation and higher rates of investment in human capital.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget and the government's ongoing work in relation to higher education starts with our broader goals—our long-term goals. I want to say that the goal of achieving 80 per cent attainment in higher education by 2050 is a very important long-term vision around which all of our policies are framed. I want to look at that in the broader sweep of what's gone on in the last 20, 30 and 40 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Hawke-Keating government in the 1980s came to power when we saw year 12 attainment rates in the mid-30 per cent range and higher education participation rates in the high teens. By the time we got to the mid-1990s, we saw year 12 completion rates in the high 70s and tertiary completion rates in the high 30s. They had essentially doubled. That saw so many more people having the opportunity to finish year 12 and so many more people, in parallel, having the opportunity to finish their tertiary education. So many of the senior ministers from that time in a government which achieved so much policy reform—across the economy, across microeconomic reform and across health—point to these higher rates of year 12 and tertiary attainment as some of the greatest achievements, if not the greatest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why it's so important that this government has set the goal of lifting tertiary attainment rates further from the rates that we saw back then. It's no coincidence that the productivity growth rates we saw in the two decades following the Hawke-Keating government were so high because tertiary achievement rates flow through to the skills level across the economy. They flow through to the research and development across the economy. They flow through to innovation. They're really important, of course, for individuals and what they have in terms of lifetime opportunities to fulfil their career dreams. They flow through to individuals in terms of their lifetime earnings, but there's also that macro story which is so critical.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Business as usual is not going to get us to 80 per cent or anywhere near it. It's absolutely critical that we see those key recommendations out of the University Accord acted upon. A key element of that is to reduce barriers to participation. There is HECS and HELP. HECS was a key reform of the 1980s which saw us increase funding to higher education but in a way that didn't create barriers for those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and other groups that are disadvantaged.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the reforms coming through in the budget, we are removing disincentives to participate in higher education from the indexation of HELP. So we are seeing that HELP will be indexed in a way now which is the lower of the wage price index or the CPI in such a way that is fairer and more sustainable and doesn't create inordinate debt for those who are participating. We also see that prac payments of $319.50 a week are going to reduce barriers for those wanting to participate in areas such as teaching, nursing, midwifery and social work. It is a really significant payment for those who otherwise would have found this kind of training a significant barrier to their participation. We're also going to see fee-free uni-ready courses right across the country significantly increased. So this is about individuals and their opportunities. It's also about the investment in skills and human capital across the economy and the long-term productivity boost that's going to give.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="IPZ" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHESTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gippsland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:28</span>):  This motion, I must say, is fairly typical of this government's approach over the last two years. There is a lot of talk and a lot of patting itself on the back. It's almost an orgy of self-congratulation, but there's very little delivery. It's a demonstration, once again, that this government is completely out of touch, particularly when it comes to policies impacting rural and regional Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the next election, Australians will be asking themselves some pretty simple questions. Australians will be asking themselves: Do I feel better or worse off? Is my family better or worse off? Do I feel safe in my family home? Do I feel safe in my community? Do I feel safe at my university campus? Is our country heading in the right direction?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I must say that young Australians have never had it worse off than under the Albanese-Bandt government. Cost-of-living pressures are pushing many young people to breaking point. We've seen skyrocketing increases in housing, in power, in groceries and in fuel. We have a housing crisis that makes it almost impossible to find an affordable place to live, particularly in the large cities but also in our regional centres, and it's all been driven by Labor's high inflation and economic mismanagement. So this attempt today by the government—it is quite a premature attempt, I must say—to pat itself on the back for a job well done when Australians are suffering like never before shows just how out of touch this government is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From a regional perspective, Deputy Speaker McKenzie—I know you understand this well, coming from the Mornington Peninsula—students are experiencing massive cost increases in the housing affordability crisis and simply can't find properties when they're forced to move to Melbourne to continue their studies and when rental costs are out of control.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The latest monthly consumer price index data shows that Labor's cost-of-living crisis is hurting hardworking Australians. Core inflation, which is the Reserve Bank's preferred measure, rose to 4.1 per cent, well above the RBA's target. Australians continue to face one of the highest and most persistent rates of inflation of any advanced economy because this government—the Albanese-Bandt government!—has failed to tackle the source of the problem. With Labor's big-spending, big-government third budget, Australian households and businesses face higher prices, higher interest rates and higher taxes for longer. Labor has confused economic priorities, and they're hurting our households and small-business owners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under Labor's two years of homegrown inflation, the costs of everyday goods keep rising. We've seen food up by 11 per cent, housing up by 14 per cent, rents up by 13 per cent, electricity up by 20 per cent, gas up by 25 per cent, health up by 11 per cent and finance and insurance up by 15 per cent, and students are obviously not immune to this crisis. Students with low or fixed incomes are finding it very hard to excel at their studies and also undertake some part-time work to fund their own cost-of-living pressures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I do say to those opposite: Where is the legislation? Where is the legislation that the minister announced would be brought to this House? There are three million Australians with a student debt. HELP loans have escalated by almost 16 per cent since the Albanese government was elected. For someone with an average loan of $26,494, it will cost them an extra $4,000 under this term of government. Under the former coalition government, the average indexation rate was just 1.7 per cent. Labor said it would—and I quote—'cut the student debt of more than three million Australians in this month's budget', referring to May, obviously. However, why has the minister failed to bring forward the legislation in time to enact these changes to help indexation? When will we see the promised reductions in student debt, and when will they be delivered?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's education budget also had some bad news for regional Australians more broadly, with the axing of the $224 million Destination Australia program, which was designed to support university students to study in our regional areas. We know that by just studying in a regional area younger people are more likely to pursue their careers in those regions and help alleviate some of the skilled workforce problems we face in our regional areas. Labor's budget cut $224 million from the Destination Australia program. The axing also of the coalition's Regional Research Collaboration program, which provided a range of supports for regional research was in the order of a $56 million loss to the regions. Again, Labor is big on talk but undermines the future of our regional communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is in stark contrast to the way the coalition government backed students in rural and regional Australia. We increased the tertiary access payment. We also provided regional university centres, and now Labor is placing those regional university centres in suburban areas.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300129" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:33</span>):  There is a challenge that Australia faces with regard to its transforming workforce. That challenge is especially prevalent in Spence. It is noted in the Universities Accord that over the next five years 50 per cent of all new jobs created will require a bachelor-level degree or higher and another 40 per cent of those jobs will require at least some form of post-secondary qualification as well. In Spence, where over 50 per cent of our electorate did not have any post-school qualifications in 2021, this means that nearly 60,000 people will be unable to work in 90 per cent of all new jobs created in the next five years. This trend will only continue to accelerate as we move toward 2050, with 55 per cent of all jobs in Australia by that point requiring tertiary levels of education. It's also pressing that only one in 10 residents in Spence are currently enrolled in a higher education program, which sits well below the national average of 15 per cent. Fortunately, this government is tackling these challenges head-on through the considerable reforms already undertaken in response to the accord, helping to ease access for people in Spence and across the country to higher education. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reforms in this budget are exactly what our community has been calling for, with a survey done by my office reflecting this. The north wants to see access to university significantly improved. My constituents are calling for an expansion of university institutions to the north. We were also told that visibility is an issue, with many in Spence forgoing the opportunities provided by tertiary institutions because of a lack of presence in our electorate. Our potential students are finding it difficult, when weighing up their future, coming out of high school or training, to consider the possibility of university when it can't be seen from where they have lived and grown up all their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also noted from our survey that there is a fundamental distance between universities and our community, not just in a geographical sense, as these institutions largely exist within the city of Adelaide, but also in a mental way: there seems to be a generational distance away from considering university education. That is why these reforms, in their capacity to bring quality higher education providers into outer metropolitan areas, are so important in ensuring that those in our community, often from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, can take full advantage of our world-class tertiary providers. This is coming in the form of suburban university study hubs, or SUSHs, offering 14 new hubs across the country, to be hosted in outer metro areas. It is bringing opportunity for the individual out to where it needs to be, for the future good of the nation as a whole. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also a focus on tertiary harmonisation, in that the government has outlined a pathway for universities, vocational training providers and TAFE to link more closely as a priority measure. It means that students already in training can upskill further and consider a wider variety of meaningful options as they move into the workforce. This will also make it easier for local industries across a range of sectors, such as manufacturing, defence and engineering, to access skilled staff already based closer to where they operate. Better still, it will enable those potential employees to link to employers with much greater ease and with a chance to work much closer to where they reside. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Building on all of this are our other budget commitments around affordability, including a $427.4 million investment over four years for a new Commonwealth prac payment. Those on placements—the future nurses, teachers and social workers of the north—can now gain meaningful experience without compromising their livelihoods. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also addressing the HECS system by limiting its indexation to the CPI or the WPI, whichever is the lower, to ensure that our students can enter the workforce and pay off debts in a sustainable manner. This will wipe around $3 billion of student debt for more than three million students. We are also investing $350 million to deliver fee-free uni-ready courses, adding to existing foundational study programs on offer at universities and providing a free, accessible means for students to enter tertiary education regardless of background or means.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are holistic measures with holistic benefits, not just at the individual level through greater access to higher quality education but for the wider community for generations to come. The foundations are being built for skilled workers, trained and educated by institutions in our patch, to be crafted right on our doorstep.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The great Australian dream of homeownership is not going away. It hasn't left the recent generation. It's such an important part of our national story, our national fabric. I think back to when I was a kid and our family history of how important the home was. My grandfather returned from the Second World War II too late to access a soldier settlement scheme. He'd been injured when a home-made still of his blew up in Papua New Guinea—a story that still raises a smile. When he came back, he missed that scheme, but, with his own hands, he built a jig to make bricks and started building a home, brick by brick, out in the scrub on the hill that looks over Warialda. He worked on it every week. It took him years to do it, but he was so proud because he finished that home the week before my mother was born. She was born in a home that he'd made, and he kept that home. They lived there for their whole lives. I was lucky enough, as a concreter in Ipswich—in Darra particularly—to watch Vietnamese Australians coming here and having their first homes built. We were building their driveways and their paths. People were proud to come to this great country and have a home of their own, something that was theirs and that was important. It was their statement to the world saying, 'Here I am.' That is not going away, as tough as times are. That is not an aspect that will die.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want it to keep going. We want people to have a place of their own where not just the economy but the nation and our stories are continued. All the things that make us great happen in the home. They're passed down through families. We want this, but it's important we point out at this time, as have many in the media, that the government, via its fiscal policy and via the budget it has just released, is making it harder and harder for that next generation of Australians to realise that great dream of Australian homeownership. It's not just me. We can look at economists across the spectrum who have pointed out the failings of this last budget. The CBA economics team said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">We had flagged that fiscal policy was one of the risks that could delay our base case that monetary policy easing would start in November this year.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The risk is now more real that the first interest rate cut could be delayed and that the neutral cash rate is higher than we currently estimate due to the expansionary fiscal setting and the high level of investment in the economy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's because of this budget. KPMG has a similar line, having pointed out, 'In the lead-up to the budget, there was a growing disconnect between monetary policy and fiscal policy, with one pressing on the brakes and the other pushing down on the accelerator.' KPMG chief economist Brendan Rynne says, 'The government has chosen to push its foot down even harder.' He says:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A neutral, even slightly contractionary, budget would have been in order to help tackle inflation. But this is not a budget designed to consolidate the nation's fiscal position and commence the task of gradually returning the budget to a sustainable position.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just these opinions; it's outcomes. The cost of health has risen nine per cent since this government came to power. The cost of food has risen 10 per cent. The cost of education has risen 11 per cent across the board. The cost of housing has risen 12 per cent. The cost of public transport has risen 13 per cent. The costs are rising. The narrow path the RBA sets for us now stretches out even further into the distance.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there are things we can do to address this. There was a pathway that this government could have taken to reduce inflation. That would have been to pull back on its spending. When we raise these questions, we're asked: 'What would you cut? What terrible cuts would you make?' I'll start with the billion dollars for a quantum computer owned by an overseas company. I'll start with billions of dollars of more subsidies into the renewable energy sector. Those are some simple cuts that we can make right off the top, but the point is—</span>

If you're a young kid out there looking to buy your own home, trying to save, trying to get on that property ladder and turning up to an open home and you're thinking, 'Wow; these lines are getting longer and longer,' they are. It's a direct policy of this government to paper over the cracks in its fiscal policy. They won't do the hard work of reducing spending, but they will deploy the bandaid of higher immigration to keep them out of a recession.

                  <a href="299150" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LAWRENCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:44</span>):  This is an interesting motion from the brave member for Groom. Here the member wishes to raise housing policy, where our government has already been much more active in the last two years than the previous coalition government was for over nine. He wishes to raise inflation, which we have reduced over the last 18 months after the Morrison government left Australia with rising inflation. Two years ago, when we came to office, the inflation rate was 6.1 per cent and rising. The member will desperately want to say it was rising for something we did, but he knows the truth. The inflation rate sits at 3.6 per cent today. The member for Groom should be congratulating the government if he is truly concerned about inflation. There are many people in Hasluck paying a mortgage, well over 50 per cent of households. All I can say is I am glad they have a federal Albanese Labor government willing to act on housing, willing to act on inflation and willing to act on cost-of-living challenges, because if the coalition were in power right now we would all be in much worse position on every measure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A housing crisis doesn't appear suddenly. We were elected with a host of policies on housing. If there is a housing crisis now, and there is, then it is either because the previous housing minister didn't know there was a problem, which would be an indictment, or he knew but didn't do enough to deal with it, which would also be an indictment. It wasn't, in fact, until the second Morrison ministry that the coalition bothered to even have a minister named for housing and they didn't sit the member for Deakin in the cabinet. Before that we'd have to go back to the second Rudd ministry, where we find the Minister for Housing and Homelessness, the Honourable Julie Collins, in the cabinet, where she sits now. That by itself shows the real difference between the coalition's attitude to housing policy, which is mainly about scoring political points, and the Albanese government's real commitment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the other thing that it shows is the difference in our commitment to funding. We have $6.2 billion in this year's budget, part of $32 billion of new housing initiatives and extensions by this government. The $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund, the HAFF, will support the construction of more social and affordable homes into the future. The coalition voted against the HAFF. The Greens delayed it by six months in order to grandstand, but the coalition voted against it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Groom and his colleagues have had a bad record in opposing legacy programs. They opposed Medicare, they opposed universal superannuation, they managed to oppose the $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund and now they have opposed the Housing Australia Future Fund. They had a chance to redeem themselves a little by supporting the Help to Buy legislation but it looks like they're opposing that too. They are opposing a lot of housing policy but they still have time to bring motions like this one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also provided for a $9.3 billion national agreement on social housing and homelessness, doubled Commonwealth homelessness funding, committed $1 billion for housing for women and children fleeing family violence, and we're investing in the construction industry with targeted fee-free TAFE places. There's more but I have only got the five minutes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll mention instead, as the motion mentions, the cost of living. We have taken a wide array of measures to assist with the family budget. Many of these would never have been enacted or even dreamt of by the coalition: investments in Medicare, bulk-billing, cheaper medicines, free urgent care clinics, fee-free TAFE, tertiary prac payments, energy bill relief, back-to-back rental assistance increases, cheaper child care, expanded parental leave, so many more things. We want people to earn more and keep more of what they earn so, yes, wages are rising for the first time in 10 years as a result of deliberate government policy and, yes, from July, every Australian taxpayer will get a tax cut. We have taken the hard decisions to combat inflation while providing cost-of-living relief.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where was the member for Groom when we capped gas prices? The opposition's unwillingness to take action would have seen inflation much higher than it is now. In the budget just delivered, the government's responsible targeted cost-of-living relief, including the energy bill payment and the increase to rent assistance, is estimated to reduce headline inflation by half a percentage point over the year and is not expected to add to pressure on inflation more broadly. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, the government's significant investments and national leadership in housing and its targeted and anti-inflationary cost-of-living assistance mean that Australians generally, particularly those that are doing it tough, are in a much better position than they would have been if there was a coalition government now. I am sure I am absolutely not alone when I say that I oppose this motion.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:49</span>):  I rise to support this motion on the importance of homeownership to Australians which has been brought by the member for Groom and I thank the member for bringing this motion to the House. Just by way of opening, I have been present for the honourable member for Hasluck's speech. It was interesting that she spent the first two minutes of her five-minute allotted time not discussing the importance of homeownership, but instead talking about all the things that the coalition, allegedly or apparently, did or didn't do when they were in. I might just remind the member that this government of which she is a part has now been in for two years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Homeownership is deeply embedded in the Australian psyche. It's called 'the great Australian dream'. The notion has been fundamental to the way our country has developed since Federation: a largely classless society built on egalitarian principles, built on the notion that most Australians are able to aspire to and achieve homeownership. Australia's founders clearly believed that this should be a property-owning democracy. They came to this view because they knew that the line upon which division is most etched in society, particularly having regard to former British society, is the ownership of property. Therefore, they decided that everyone needs to be given the chance to own the home in which they live, needs to be given the opportunity to purchase their first home, and this is one area where this government has really let Australians down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Homeownership has never been less affordable than under this government. Let's look first of all at the deposit that's required. From the 1960s right through even to the 1990s, it took on average months, or a small number of years, to save the deposit for the average Australian home on an average Australian wage or salary. Now it is 12 years. To service a loan in Sydney now takes an income of over $280,000 per year. This is making homeownership absolutely impossible for gen Z and absolutely impossible for millennials. We can just look at the numbers. In the 1970s the average age of first home buyers was 25 years. It's now 36 years. The seventh-largest lender in Australia to first home buyers is now the 'bank of mum and dad'. This means that for the first time in Australia we're approaching a position where whether or not you own a home will depend almost entirely upon the circumstances of your birth. That is not the attitude, not the culture that has been Australia—and it's untenable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What could the Albanese Labor government be doing? First of all, it could be taking some of the pressure off the demand side. That is, it could be reining in inflation, and bringing back a sensible and sustainable immigration policy that links immigration to the existing housing and infrastructure that we have here. At present, we have four immigrants coming in for every one dwelling being built in Australia. This is unplanned and unsustainable. We need immigrants in Australia. Contemporary Australia has been built on the back of immigration. But the policy that has been introduced by this government is unsustainable, and it is locking Australians out of the housing market.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Housing supply is something this government should be addressing. While largely the remit of state and local governments, federal government does have levers to assist with supply and could be further assisting first home buyers. It could be incentivising local and state governments to increase housing densities in line with existing infrastructure and transport hubs. There is plenty the government could be doing and should be doing to increase supply.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll turn briefly to mortgage stress, because the motion refers to mortgage stress. We now have a large number of Australians—over 1.6 million, or 31.4 per cent of mortgage holders—experiencing mortgage stress. This is linked directly to the 12 interest rate rises in a row that we have seen under the Albanese Labor government. Again, reining in inflation to control interest rates is something this government could and should be doing through its fiscal policy. The Albanese Labor government is letting Australians down on homeownership and is letting Australians down on mortgage stress. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:54</span>):  The member for Groom has raised a motion to talk about homeownership. Sadly, his party wasn't so keen on housing during the decade they were actually in charge, let alone on taking action on any of the issues they've raised. I note that the member for Hughes—who doesn't look anything like the former member for Hughes!—was raising that immigration issue in relation to housing: a dog whistle so loud that the canines are complaining about it! It is shameful. And now what have we seen the opposition do? The only action they—and the Greens—have taken on housing is to say no. The message they're sending to Australians is, 'We don't want to help you into a home.' The Leader of the Opposition in the budget reply speech—that eagerly anticipated document—did not announce one dollar of funding to take action on housing issues. The Greens, in their relentless pursuit of headlines, have come up with a housing proposal that experts have already called a 'very expensive and arbitrary lottery'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition is a one-trick pony when it comes to superannuation. They see superannuation solely as personal savings to be raided for a home deposit. It doesn't matter that the member for Groom and his colleagues would decimate hardworking Australians' retirement funds and, with it, their long-term financial security. Independent economist Saul Eslake described the idea of using superannuation for a housing deposit as 'one of the worst public policy decisions of the 21st century'. You'll always have that, coalition; you'll always have that. The Super Members Council agreed, indicating that this would increase property prices by nine per cent and could cost taxpayers a cumulative $1 trillion—private stimulus as lighter fluid into an already overheated market. Brilliant idea! I'm sure that the former Deputy Prime Minister will come up and try and distance the Nationals from that madness. It seems that even the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has realised that this isn't a sound economic plan. The deputy leader said, 'Young people need their super for retirement, not to try to take pressure off an urban housing bubble.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The challenges in the housing sector that we face today weren't created by Labor, but we fully take responsibility to deal with them. Labor understands that it's still the Australian dream to own your own home. Labor understands the importance of having a safe and stable place to call home, and Labor understands that Australians need to feel their homes are secure during a turbulent economic time, without sacrificing their long-term financial security. That's why Labor's Homes for Australia plan was a key part of our budget. Our goal is to build 1.2 million homes by the end of the decade. Yes, it's an ambitious goal, but it's supported by $6.2 billion in the budget and supported by directing $1 billion towards the infrastructure needed to build those new homes more quickly: the roads, the sewerage, the energy and water connections needed for new developments and more social housing. We're backing it up with more fee-free TAFE places in the construction industry so we can train the tradies we need to build our new homes, while the opposition are trying to stop tradies coming in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In partnership with the states and territories, the Help to Buy scheme is an innovative policy which will give 40,000 Australians on low and middle incomes the opportunity to purchase a home. The scheme will support the purchase and the construction of new and existing homes, including houses, house and land packages, townhouses and apartments. It will help participants to overcome the hurdle of saving for a deposit and the hurdle of servicing a mortgage. Labor's housing reforms are the most significant in a generation. They include the Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee—something that I'm sure all sensible Nats would be supportive of—and the expanded Home Guarantee Scheme, which has already helped more than 110,000 people into homeownership in the last two years. The Housing Australia Future Fund is the single biggest investment in social and affordable housing in more than a decade. The new $9.3 billion five-year national agreement on social housing and homelessness with the states and territories focuses on reducing homelessness, providing crisis support, and building and repairing social housing. As part of this, we've doubled the Commonwealth homelessness funding to $400 million every year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know tough times are here for a lot of Australians. Labor is working hard to reduce the inflation levels that we inherited, and we're making some good progress. There is more to be done, obviously, but to go from an inflation rate of six per cent to three per cent is a good start. Labor's ambitious housing reform agenda has already made significant progress in tackling the housing challenges that were left to us by those opposite. Labor is helping more Australians into their own homes, and we'll keep doing this vital and necessary work. I say to the member for Groom: step away from your coalition policy bin fire and put that lighter fluid down.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="219646" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:59</span>):  Let's put some facts on the table and some common sense into this debate, unlike the member for Moreton's contribution. Let's talk about what we did in our decade of government: 220,000 trade apprentices—a record high, Member for Moreton—and 1,213 major transport projects supporting 100,000 jobs. I say that because, when you build homes, look through state government planning laws and help out with councils, you need to have the supportive infrastructure, and that's what we did.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What did Labor do when they came to government? They put in a 90-day review—code for 'delay'—for all the infrastructure projects. It ended up being more than 200 days. That stymied so much of the development and activity in that space. There were 135,000 new home projects backed by HomeBuilder, and I compliment the member for Deakin in his role as the minister. Now, of course, he's the shadow minister in this portfolio space.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Moreton talked about dog whistling and the member for Hughes. I think that was crass, but let's look at the facts, shall we? Immigration hit an all-time high of 765,900 people last year. Total immigration numbers have hit another all-time high, with 100,000 new arrivals this February alone. If you feel that those are big numbers, consider this: in the Howard era Australia averaged 110,000 arrivals a year. So that's 110,000 a year compared to 100,000 just in February alone. What is that doing to the housing market? I'll tell you what it's doing. It's placing that much unnecessary pressure, mainly, on the housing market in metropolitan Australia and the housing market on the east coast of Australia, where most Australians live.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is not doing anything to address that, but what they are doing is being very worried by the prospect of the Greens looking at taking them down a path they don't want to go—that is, taking over the states' responsibility to provide social housing. I genuinely fear what might happen after the next election, whenever that might be—whether it's later this year and Labor start to panic and hit the double-dissolution trigger or whether it's in May next year, when it is due—and fear, potentially, the numbers falling the way they shouldn't and Labor forming a very, very dangerous alliance with the Greens. An Albanese-Bandt government would not be good for this nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen construction companies collapse in this nation. They continue 'to fall like dominoes'. Those are not my words; that's from the Property Investor on 17 January 2024. The trend only worsened in the second half of 2023, and 'around 100 more Victorian homeowners are in limbo as another builder folds', the report relayed. According to the Housing Industry Association, the construction market is facing one of the worst storms since the energy crisis in the mid-seventies. What we're seeing is construction companies going to the wall day after day, and, if they're not going to the wall, they are doing what Dennis Family Homes started to do in late 2022, and that is curtailing regional activities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A range of factors have created the perfect storm for the demise of builders in the country. Lawyer Jennifer Dizon works with the commercial litigation insolvency firm Hicks Oakley Chessell Williams. She said to ABC News:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">A large number of builders have faced economic distress due to significant increases in interest rates and cost of materials, labour shortages and supply-chain issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, she is so right. I know that, whether it's in the housing construction business or infrastructure construction business, it is just so hard. We've seen recently that Stevens Construction, based on the New South Wales Central Coast, has unfortunately been forced to stop work effective immediately. That was just last month. Australia continues to battle through its worst phase for the construction industry in 50 years, and it's on Labor's watch.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is Labor doing about it? Well, they're talking about everything but. They only realised there was a cost-of-living crisis last year after the Voice referendum was defeated. They come to this place and talk about everything that regional and Middle Australia don't want them to talk about. Get your heads in the game; the game is housing and making sure that we address the cost-of-living crisis.</span>

                  <a href="245392" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GOSLING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:04</span>):  Our government understand that too many Australians, after 10 years of absolutely disgraceful government, are facing serious housing challenges. We need to build more homes more quickly and in more parts of the country. That's why our government has an ambitious goal of building 1.2 million homes by the end of this decade—a decade that will be marked by the construction of homes, unlike the last decade of those opposite in power.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The latest budget, 2024-25, included $6.2 billion in new investment to build more homes to support Australians, bringing our government's new housing initiatives to $32 billion—that's with a 'b'. The budget commits $1 billion to get homes built immediately, and funding for states and territories also to build the roads, sewerage, energy, water and community infrastructure we need for new homes and for additional social housing—infrastructure that was let slide for so long under those opposite. Our policies were informed, carefully considered and guided by experts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the market response to deliver new housing supply has been impacted by COVID factors; however, that variety of factors means that the economics of new construction are a bit out of kilter, and we do acknowledge that, which is why we need to lean in. The Reserve Bank estimates that overall construction prices have risen almost 40 per cent since late 2019. In simple terms, supply has not kept up with demand, resulting in higher rents and house price rises. While the Albanese government is not promising an immediate fix to the solution, because that would be dishonest, we are activating our plan called Homes for Australia to build those 1.2 million new homes over the next five years. We are also helping Australians to build, rent and buy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Homes for Australia plan focuses on four key actions: training more tradies, finding more partnerships to grow the workforce, kick-starting construction by cutting red tape and getting those approvals moving, and providing incentives to state and territory governments to get homes built quickly, to meet and beat 1.2 million home target. In addition, there are funds for veteran and domestic violence housing, and we have seen that in my electorate of Solomon, as well as the recently announced $4 billion—with a 'b'—partnership between the federal and territory governments for remote housing. I think all honourable members understand how much of a priority that is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other elements include the requirement for universities to increase student accommodation stock to take pressure off the local rental market. I congratulate Charles Darwin University on today's announcement of a new student accommodation building expected to house around 350 students in the CBD of Darwin. Big increases to Commonwealth rent assistance will help more than 5,000 Territory households with the cost of living.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On housing and immigration in Darwin and Palmerston in the electorate I am so proud to serve, we know that, whether it is skilled migration or international students, many sectors of our economy depend on new Territorians. All businesses in the Territory know how tight the labour market is. My office deals daily with businesses who need workers with those essential skills to build a local economy, to provide care for Territorians and to help us fulfil the Territory's potential while we get our young people trained up and working.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This place based approach to international students and migrant workers is essential for the development of the north, and I know that our government understands that. An important component of Homes for Australia is the Help to Buy scheme, which will be life changing for many Australians, indeed, many Territorians, and those living in my electorate. A lot of people renting now could afford a mortgage but aren't able to save up to 20 per cent deposit. The Help to Buy scheme helps those people get over that hurdle of a deposit, bringing homeownership back into reach for thousands of Australians and Territorians, particularly those that are renting. Help to Buy is targeted at helping low- and middle-income Australians get into a home with just a two per cent deposit. The government will support eligible homebuyers with an equity contribution, which is up to 40 per cent for new homes and 30 per cent for existing homes. It can also help eligible new homeowners save hundreds every month on their mortgage repayments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will continue to work with the member for Lingiari, the minister for housing, the NT government and industry to build more Territory homes.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr WOLAHAN:</span>
                  </a>  The member for Hawke isn't sitting in the chair—I noticed that—and God help us when he does!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The census tells us a lot about ourselves. In the last census, we learned something we instinctively know, which is those born between 1981 and 1996, otherwise known as millennials, are our largest generation. I sit on the House economics committee with the member for Hawke and we see all of the data that most Australians see about the cost-of-living pressures in our country. When you see that data broken up by age, that cohort, millennials, are being hit the absolute hardest. Their incomes aren't very high to start with and the cost of utilities, of rent, of HECS are continually ballooning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you look at a median salary—and I would like to take you to a median-income scenario—that person in Australia would probably have a monthly income of about $3,800; $452 would go out in tax. With a net income of $3,300, there are Medicare levies, there are rates, there's HECS, there's rent—the median rent in my area is about $1,500—utilities of $300, groceries of $500, home insurance of $125, public transport costs of $72 and phone costs of about $100. And then, when you add basic insurance, someone in my electorate on a median income has, if they don't spend any money on anything else, about $465 left in their pocket. I haven't included going to the movies, going to concerts, going on a holiday—all the things that can bring people joy in life. That's what they've got left.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you take the median home cost in my electorate of just over $1 million—so half of them are more expensive, half of them are less—the time it would take that person to save a 20 per cent deposit of $256,000, including stamp duty, is 45 years. So it is no wonder that, throughout our country, there are dining table conversations between generations where we are hearing that people are giving up on the idea of homeownership because on that maths it doesn't add up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can stand here, in motions like this, and throw shade on the other side about what you did wrong or what we did great, but the truth is that all sides of politics have let this generation down. So let's start there. And when we start there, we can then begin to look at what are the levers we can pull that will make a difference. If we do that, we can actually start to look this generation in the eye and say that we are in this place to care for your interests and not ourselves, not our party, and so when you hear that shade being thrown from the other side, know that they are not putting your interests first.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a complex problem. There are federal levers; there are state levers; there are local council issues. But let's start from the position that we are in now is unacceptable. Even if somehow, magically, we reduce those 45 years for that median income for the median house, that person is probably not going to get a loan. They're not going to compete with the lack of supply that is pushing them out of being competitive in those auctions and those sales. I thought it was bad several years ago when my family bought a house, but it is monumentally harder now. You know that, and you expect us to do something about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no one lever that's going to fix it. Anyone who promises that is being dishonest. But we have to recognise that there is a capacity for government to build houses, build schools, build hospitals, build roads and preserve green space in a way that is proportionate. That is why migration is part of the mix. It's not anti-migrant; we're still going to have a very generous, if not one of the most generous, migration programs in the world—as we should. When you hear the other side talk about that, they know that too. They will say on some forums, 'We're bringing migration down,' and then on other forums they will accuse people of dog whistling. It can't be both. Both sides know that's a problem, but we must recognise this is a fundamental structural problem with our economy and our society, and we need to fix it.</span>

                  <a href="129164" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:14</span>):  Deputy Speaker McKenzie, I also congratulate you on your elevation to the Speaker's panel. Well done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the member for Menzies departs, I note that he raised the issue of the median price of $1 million for a house in his electorate and the high deposit involved in that. I say to the member for Menzies: get behind Help to Buy. It's currently stuck in the Senate with your Liberal colleagues and the Greens, who are holding it up. Under that scheme, an $850,000 house in Melbourne could be bought with a two per cent deposit under a shared-equity scheme that all the state governments, including former Liberal state governments, have got behind. So, Member for Menzies, we are looking at solutions. I urge you to urge your colleagues to get behind them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the member for Groom for moving this motion, but his frustrations, frankly, are misplaced and come two years too late. I join with the member in recognising just how important homeownership is to Australian families. He is right when he says Australian households are doing it tough. We know this. But the member could not be more wrong in claiming that this government has failed to take the cost-of-living crisis seriously. We inherited from the member's former government an economy of increasing interest rates and growing repayments which have impacted household budgets. When we came to office, inflation had a 6 in front of it. Now it's a 3.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know it's still so tough for a lot of Australians, and that is why attacking the cost of living is Labor's No. 1 priority. In a few short weeks, every Australian taxpayer will get a tax cut and keep more of what they earn when the Albanese Labor government's cost-of-living tax cuts come into effect from 1 July. I can't say it enough: nine in 10 taxpayers in my electorate of Lyons will get a bigger tax cut because of the changes this government made to stage 3. It is a terrific change—the right change made for the right reasons.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's just one of the ways that we are working to make life more affordable for people and families in my electorate and for all Australians. We are delivering tax cuts for every taxpayer and energy rebates for every household, working to boost real wages, fight inflation and drive fairer prices for consumers. The hallmark of our government is more jobs, higher wages, bigger tax cuts and a future made in Australia. That is what this government is delivering. Labor is wiping around $3 billion in student debt and making medicines cheaper. We're providing a better deal for every working parent by paying super on government paid parental leave. It is clear the Albanese government is committed to delivering real cost-of-living relief, helping to reduce inflation pressures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes specifically to housing, it's very simple: Labor wants more homes while the Liberals voted for less. We have already committed $32 billion over the next decade, including more than $6 billion in this year's budget. We have done more in two years than the former government did in 10. In his budget reply, the Leader of the Opposition did not announce one dollar in funding to address Australia's housing challenges. There was plenty of dog-whistling but no money, no detail and no policy. Labor's housing policies focus on more supply and more affordability for buyers and renters. The Albanese government's housing agenda is squarely aimed at boosting the supply of all housing—more social and affordable rental homes, more homes to rent and more homes to buy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After a decade of Liberal neglect, it's clear that Australia does not have enough homes. The Liberals left it to the private market, and there has clearly been massive market failure. Too many Australians face serious housing challenges as a result, and that's why we're stepping in. We know we need to build more homes more quickly in more parts of the country, particularly in the regions. It's why the Albanese government has an ambitious goal of building 1.2 million homes by the end of the decade through our Homes for Australia Plan. We are doing more in two years than those opposite did in 10.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll finish where I started: Help to Buy. It's currently stuck in the Senate because the Liberals and the Greens simply will not get behind this shared-equity scheme. We have similar schemes already operating at the state level. They work really well. We are trying to get it operating at the federal level. Get behind it. It will get more young people into homes more quickly. They can get on the first rung of the ownership ladder. Get behind Help to Buy. Get behind homeownership for young Australians.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BROADBENT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:19</span>):  Over the past year or so, I've been following Matt Barrie, an award-winning Australian technology entrepreneur who has his finger well and truly on Australia's housing pulse—a pulse that is weak, sluggish and in desperate need of immediate resuscitation. As Matt said recently:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The root of all evil in this country is the astronomical price of housing. Once you understand all the ramifications of that—it really is the problem that is the root of all problems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I couldn't agree more, Matt. Matt also delivered a sobering message. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… it is now mathematically impossible for a household on the median income to pay off a mortgage in Australia …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What happened to the lucky country? What happened to the clever country? Since when did the offer of a car park to sleep in for homeless women and children become a solution? The current situation is that, despite the Reserve Bank increasing interest rates to get a hold of inflation, property prices in capital cities in Australia continued to surge another 20 per cent last year. Matt Barrie said a home is considered astronomically unaffordable by economists if it costs more than five times the average salary. In Australia, the average capital city home is nine times the average salary of Australians and, in Sydney, it's an eye-watering 13 times. So who's to blame? This has been an issue on the horizon for decades now, so the blame has to be apportioned to all sides of politics, but Labor's immigration policy—bringing in 518,000 people in 2022-23—has served only to inflame this already hot issue to the point where now homeownership is unaffordable for the vast majority of the Australian population.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the solution? Economist Yanis Varoufakis has told the Equity Mates Investing podcast that another one million homes were needed in Australia within the next three years. He said that any measures to increase the affordability of housing, such as lowering interest rates or government grants, would only increase prices. Australia is in the middle of a dire housing crisis, and the impact on families with young children is particularly distressing. Not only is housing ridiculously expensive both to rent and to buy but the homes are simply not there. In response to this, the government claim they can build over a million houses in just five years. As it said in the great story, 'They're dreaming.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians need these homes desperately, but there are significant limitations that will prevent this ambitious target from being met. Firstly, new housing starts came in at the lowest level in more than a decade last year: 90,000 below an annual target of 240,000 homes. Secondly, Australian builders and construction firms are collapsing at an unprecedented rate. According to ASIC, between July 2022 and April 2023, 1,709 building and construction companies across Australia went into administration. These aren't just small companies. These are big names like Porter Davis, ProBuild, Pivotal Homes and many others who have been operating for decades. Thirdly, across New South Wales, migrant families are apparently taking up more than 35,000 social housing tenancies—over 22 per cent of all tenancies in the state. And, on top of this, there's a dire shortage of skilled building workers. Between collapsing construction companies, the scarcity of skilled workers and booming population, how on earth can we build enough houses for Australians and for the hundreds of thousands of migrants hoping Australia will give them a better life?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government of the day can make all the promises they like, and they can throw billions of taxpayers' funds to the states but, at the end of the day, the homes are simply not being built. We need to rebuild our collapsing construction industry, and we need to do that quickly before the housing crisis becomes a humanitarian crisis. The facts show there is stark inequality in my generation's ability to own a home compared to that of much younger generations. Wages are not going up at the rate that the cost of housing is going up. In fact, at the moment, wages have the greatest ever decline, in terms of purchasing power. For 20- to 24-year-olds, the real purchasing power of wages went back to 2008 levels in the last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that governments love to talk about how they're going to solve our problems, but actually doing it is a very different story. The truth is that, contrary to what we are told, Australia's housing crisis isn't a very complicated problem to fix. In fact, the solution is rather simple. Australia's priority should be to create an environment where the RBA is encouraged to reduce interest rates, which the recent federal budget certainly hasn't allowed. With lower interest rates, levels of investment in housing can return to what they used to be. Naturally this will encourage more houses to be built, thus increasing the supply of houses to build and to rent. There is also another underlying problem for our young people which no doubt also has its role to play in the housing crisis at hand. Young people—even those with high-level qualifications—are struggling to get into the jobs that they want. This may be due to things like the receding economy or the increased presence of international students, but the point is this: the barrier to homeownership and job choice, which are significant parts of growing up, is too high and is affecting our kids' attitude to life. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:24</span>):  Thank you, Deputy Speaker. I congratulate you on your elevation to the Speaker's panel. May you deliberate fairly and fearlessly in your important role.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very pleased to speak on this important motion about housing. I have been taking some notice of the opposition's remarks throughout this debate—not that much, as the member for Hawke has pointed out, but some. I think it's important to make a couple of observations. First of all, for those opposite to come into this place and lecture the government about action on housing takes a particular bit of gall, because they decided when they were in government that investment in social and affordable housing was a matter for the states. They didn't want to have anything to do with it. They washed their hands of any investment in social housing. They took themselves away from the table and didn't invest a penny in the construction of social housing. You'd think that, after spending a decade in government, their keystone policy—to ensure that more people can buy a home—wouldn't be released in the final hour before midnight before the election, after the former member for Goldstein announced some policy that they then decided they were going to adopt. That policy was, of course, raiding one's own superannuation in order to pay for a home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not sure if those opposite have ever had a conversation with a young person. The average superannuation for young Australians who are looking to get into their own home is not the hundreds of thousands of dollars that you may need in order to try and get a deposit; it's often $15,000 to $20,000. A lot of young people are casual workers or haven't been able to build up the sort of superannuation that you would need in order to get a deposit. Those who were the former government—they're the opposition right now—are only interested in basically saying to young people, who don't have much superannuation, 'You can just raid what little superannuation you've got to not be able to pay for a deposit in and of itself.' So the policy doesn't really make any sense. It's also unfair and won't do anything to improve supply of housing, which is so desperately needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just say for one second that you did want to help people get into the housing market. The Help to Buy schemes are working really well across the country. State governments are working through these schemes quite successfully, and the Albanese government has announced that we want to have a national Help to Buy scheme. That will allow people on lower and middle incomes to get into the housing market with something like a two per cent deposit. The government would help take equity and look to partner with people in order to bring down the total cost of a mortgage. It's a pretty straightforward financial model, and it's one that has worked in the past.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What did those opposite do—the so-called bastions of homeownership, as they like to pat themselves on the back for being? They teamed up with the Greens—the Greens!—to block Labor's Help to Buy scheme. If you were serious about trying to get people into the housing market, why would you make it harder for people who can't afford the five per cent or 10 per cent deposit to get a mortgage? Why would you try to prevent people who can afford only a two per cent deposit from getting into the housing market? That says that those opposite are more interested in coming into this place and playing politics than in actually helping people to get into the housing market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a different approach. We want to invest in the homes that Australians need. We've got a huge program of investment to finally bring the federal government back to the table, in terms of the investment in social housing, to ensure that there is investment to increase supply across the housing spectrum for home owners, renters and those in affordable or social housing. We don't want people being pushed from rental stress into the social housing system, which we know is a real and constant pressure that Australians are facing, with the cost-of-living pressures. So we want to make sure that there is enough supply. We also want to make sure that there is investment in domestic and family violence shelters so that people who do have a change of circumstance in their own home are able to get to somewhere else safely.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, those opposite didn't support the Housing Australia Future Fund, which was to invest in all of these things. We're going to keep investing in the homes that Australians need. We're going to keep investing in the housing market, and we're going to allow more Australians to own their own home—unlike those opposite, who just come in here and play politics.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  Nothing consumes Sydneysiders like real estate, but in the last few years the gloss has well and truly worn off. Soaring rents, mortgages and house prices have become a source of pain and distress for many, and the difficulty for first-home buyers to break into the housing market is driving intergenerational inequality.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my seat of Mackellar on the Northern Beaches of Sydney, the median house price is now $2.5 million, and for a two-bedroom apartment it is $1.3 million. The lack of affordable housing is causing social dislocation, as local children and grandchildren often must move far away from their families and networks in search of a home of their own. At the same time, I know the people of the Northern Beaches put a high value on our beautiful local environment and heritage, and many don't want to see this change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I'm holding the Mackellar People's Jury on Housing later this month. This exercise in deliberative democracy will bring together 30 people who have been randomly selected as representatives of our community. They will be asked to work with a range of experts for a day to come up with considered consensus solutions to the housing crisis that fit our community. This form of participatory democracy is crucial to building trust in our political system and in us as representatives of our community. It also provides legitimacy to the policies we advocate for on their behalf. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:01</span>):  Recently I was invited to the Buddha's Light International Association, the Sri Lanka Buddhist temple and the Australia Buddhist Bliss Culture Mission in my electorate of Tangney to celebrate Vesak day, which was on the full moon day of May. There are more than 600,000 in the Buddhist communities in Australia who celebrate Vesak day. Vesak day commemorates the birth, enlightenment and passing of the Buddha. It is a day of deep reflection, spiritual renewal and universal compassion. Humans are the most intelligent beings on earth. We should all use our wisdom and creativity to build a better, brighter world for all of us to live in, not to create dispute, division, conflict, unrest or war. The Buddha's teachings serve as a beacon of hope and a reminder of the timeless teaching of peace, tolerance and nonviolence. His teachings resonate across cultures, religions and generations, offering timeless wisdom that I often reflect on as a member of this House. May the Vesak day celebration inspire all of us to strive for a world where the light of wisdom and compassion illuminates every corner of Australia and every corner of the world, guiding us towards a future of peace, harmony and prosperity for all.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  One of my constituents, Ian Ross, contacts me almost weekly about the ads for online gambling he gets on the AFL app despite having ticked the 'under 18' box. We've notified the AFL, and they say the issue has been fixed, but he still gets the ads. This is a weekly reminder that we need to break the deep connection between online gambling and our sporting codes, media and politicians. Almost a year ago, a parliamentary committee unanimously recommended a ban on all ads for online gambling, as we did with tobacco decades ago. But gambling can be a hard habit to kick, whether you're a punter with an addiction who sees ads everywhere you look or a major sporting code that sees gambling revenue everywhere you look.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Problem gambling can lead to mental health issues, family breakdown and domestic violence. The AFL makes a lot of money from online gambling—a cut every time someone bets on a game, direct sponsorship, and an inflated broadcast deal because of the potential gambling ad revenue. The media companies don't want to kick the habit either. Gambling ad spend has tripled in the last decade because it works. Young people now see gambling as an integral part of watching sport, but it's not. Politicians are scared to upset the media companies and sporting codes, even though Australians are sick of gambling ads polluting every sporting experience. We have had enough. This government must ban online gambling ads now.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:04</span>):  Recently I visited a place in my electorate where the magic happens. By that I am referring to Magic: The Gathering, and that place is Table Top Warfare in Gawler. They also cater for a number of other games, ranging from Warhammer 40K to Dungeons and Dragons through to many card games like Star Wars: Unlimited, a game I took quite a liking to on the day. This place has been a fixture in Gawler for well over six years now. They've been recognised for the past three years as the best business in Gawler by the Gawler Business Development Group.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">For many, opening a small business successfully can be akin to rolling dice but, luckily for Wayne, Mark and the team at Table Top Warfare, many of their dice have 20 sides to them. They are not only a shopfront where one can purchase games and hobby supplies but also a place where a community spanning hundreds will regularly congregate. They will play a game or two, compete in a tournament, and share a laugh and socialise with friends in a safe and welcoming environment. Being there took me back in time to the days when I dabbled in Shadowrun, Magic: The Gathering and a bit of D&amp;D.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I give a big thank you to store owner Wayne Fischer for showing me how they run a small business that is not just successful but also provides a great deal of community good. Anyone who is looking for a game, get out to Gawler Table Top Warfare. They have a huge range. There is something for everyone in the family.</span>

I want to thank Tarkan Fahri, President of the Australian North Cyprus Friendship Association, for his kind invitation to meet with this soccer team and join the community in celebrating this great milestone. In attendance also were the Chamber of Australian Cypriot Turkish Professionals, the Northern Cyprus Turkish Association of New South Wales, the Turkish Cypriots of Australia—Social Media Platforms and, of course, our local residents who identify as Turkish Cypriots.</span>

It's this diversity that I want to preserve. At these events I proudly talk about the privilege that we have been given to rebuild our lives in Australia under the one Australian flag. Whatever conflict zones we have come from, I encourage and emphasise the importance of how as new Australians we must forge forward to ensure that those conflicts do not follow us to our new homeland.</span>

It's not something my generation was taught about at school. It marks the first recorded massacre of Aboriginal people by the military in Australian history.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Battle of Richmond Hill started with yam beds being removed around the rivers by settlers to plant corn. Aboriginal people who depended on the yam instead harvested the corn. In late May 1795, when the corn was ripening, Acting Governor Paterson sent more than 60 soldiers to the Hawkesbury with the purpose of killing as many Aboriginal people as they could and driving the rest away. The dead were to be strung up on wooden posts. We don't know how many people died, but a small group were taken prisoner, including a woman with a baby which died of gunshot wounds.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dharug elder Chris Tobin shared this story, and Melissa Stubbings told the history of the memorial, created in 2002 at St John of God in North Richmond, thanks to the support of the brothers and the organisation. Over two decades, people have been invited to come and learn the truth of colonial settlement: that, in the Hawkesbury, Dharug people fought for, killed for and died for the right to access the land that sustained them.</span>

The facility is used by 16 sporting and recreational clubs as a home ground, and 25 community groups use the building and the nearby Guy Daniel Clubroom.</span>

There have been four design options developed for presentation to the community for feedback, ranging from full to partial redevelopment. The cost estimates for a project of this scale range from $15 million to $20 million, requiring funding contributions from all three levels of government. To date, a commitment of $2½ million from the WA state government has been secured by the member for Joondalup, Emily Hamilton MLA, to anchor the project. Moving forward, I am fully committed to working closely with the City of Joondalup and the state government to secure the remainder of the funding necessary to deliver this much-needed landmark sporting and community facility.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:10</span>):  For many migrant communities, maintaining the cultural and linguistic connection with one's heritage while integrating into our modern Australian culture can be a challenge, particularly through each generation. This is a challenge that Father George Adamakis and his committee at the St Catherine Greek Orthodox Church in Malvern East have embraced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">St Catherine's has a growing constituency that comes from further afield. It is testament to its welcoming culture and strong community focus, with multigenerational gatherings at church services or in language classes, where teachers with decades of experience teaching youngsters serve to preserve culture and bonds between the generations. Thanks to Father George's efforts, St Catherine's is bridging the gap between the community's Greek-speaking migrants and their first- and second-generation Australian children, keeping them in the tent. It's about making Greek culture and heritage accessible for young people to keep that tethering secure—a foot in each camp but secure in both. Young people were everywhere at a recent Palm Sunday luncheon I attended, with food prepared by the army of ladies supported by the generosity of successful local businesses that are Greek in origin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the story of Australians of Greek heritage. Early generations forged businesses, overcoming barriers to their participation, and went on to create lanes for younger generations. That's social mobility in action, created by community for community.</span>

BASE Services is a community organisation that has had great support over the years from locals on the ground. It's no wonder why. They provide training for young people who've experienced homelessness, to get them into jobs in the community. They run the local soup kitchen in town, and I can assure you, as the cold winter nights start to set upon us, that there is unfortunately a very long line joining that soup kitchen. They run 2nd Shot, a coffee shop right in the middle of town. It's a great place to start your day.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They've kicked off their Homeless for a Week campaign this year with the ambitious target of raising $1 million. Sadly, as you walk through the streets of Toowoomba, you can see the need is there, in alleyways and out the front of shops. We've never seen that before. There are people experiencing homelessness, and Nat and Tiff at BASE Services are really doing a great job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's wonderful to see the community get behind them and support them. I want to name, specifically, the good councillor Gary Gardner, who's donated his entire salary across his term in government to support charities. This year it's going to BASE Services. That amount was met by an unknown contributor, and we thank them too. I just can't help but say to the Toowoomba community: please get behind this one. It's been wonderful. Last week LifeFlight raised over $1 million in a night. Get behind BASE Services. They do a great job and they need our help.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:13</span>):  The Albanese Labor government's supporting the Fair Work Commission decision to raise the minimum wage for millions of Australians by 3.75 per cent this year. The coalition does not support that. The Albanese Labor government's delivering energy rebates for every household, providing rebates for eligible small businesses. When the coalition last had an opportunity to vote on that, they voted against it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 1 July this year, in 28 days time, every taxpayer in my electorate of Blair—80,000 people—will get a tax cut as part of the Albanese Labor government's 2024-25 budget. The average tax cut for taxpayers in my electorate will be $1,380, or $26 a week. Under Labor's plan, 90 per cent will be better off. That is great news.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're delivering a bigger tax cut for people on low and middle incomes who are doing it tough. People earning less than $45,000 a year—that is, 2.9 million Australians—will now get the tax relief they deserve, which they would not have got under the Morrison government. Under our plan, more women will get a bigger tax, while local nurses, teachers and truck drivers in my community will be the big winners with more than 95 per cent of these taxpayers getting a bigger tax break. That is because we want people to keep more of their wages and salaries and to earn more, and those opposite will not support them earning more or keeping more of what they earn.</span>

They are not mugs, and she has been misleading them about the Pinjarra heavy haulage deviation. Over 700 heavy haulage trucks thunder through Pinjarra every single day. As industry grows in our region, that number will rise. The deviation is a bypass and it will send hundreds of trucks around town, making it safer and quieter.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I fought hard to secure funding with the coalition government, and we got $200 million to build the deviation. That was cut by the Albanese government last year. Last November, Robyn Clarke promised that the Cook government would fund the difference. She has been telling locals that a project would be delivered in this budget. But last month, when Labor released its state budget, the lie was revealed. Of the estimated $250 million it will take the build the deviation, only $40 million is in the forward spending. When I pointed this out on Facebook, Robyn Clarke said I couldn't read a budget paper and the money was there. But unfortunately for Robyn, I and others on Facebook can read a budget paper and the promised money simply isn't there.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The sad truth is that Robyn Clarke is misleading my community. Labor has delayed the project yet again, and there is no chance of this deviation being close to finished before 2030 under Labor. My region needs a deviation now and only our shire president, David Bolt, now the Liberal candidate for Murray Wellington, has a plan to deliver this project. He is your man to back in March next year.</span>

Now in its 53rd year, the date was an appropriate celebration of the club, its members and the support it provides to our community. The club supports local schools, 12 intraclubs and provides grants to groups like the Autism Advisory and Support Service, the Ingham institute and Youth off the Streets. These and many others are provided with much-needed money. In fact, the club makes more that $2 million a year available to groups like the Liverpool Women's Health Centre, Middleton Grange Rural Fire Brigade, junior cricket clubs, and scholarships for local schools.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The day also recognises HSC high achievers, dux of schools, trade and arts achievements. The support provided assists with tuition fees and with buying materials to make the transition to tertiary education easier for students. The club honoured Phil Coleman's retirement from the board after 42 years. Mr Coleman has actively supported our community all of that time, including seven years as president. Father Paul Monkerud, Episcopal Vicar for Western Region also celebrated a milestone birthday. I recognise all the club does to support our community. It's a wonderful treasure for all of our volunteers and the support they provide is fantastic.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mitchell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:18</span>):  Today I had the great honour of engaging with representatives from Youth with a Mission Medical Ships Service, including the esteemed new patron, Madame Michelle Marape, the wife of Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea and Mr Charles Abel, who was a former Deputy Prime Minister, who both serve as copatrons of this vital organisation. For 14 years, the collaborative medical ships initiative between Papua New Guinea and Australia has yielded remarkable health benefits for the people of PNG. The 14-year tenure of the program has been a cornerstone of primary health care in the region in PNG, reaching about 161,000 individuals and conducting 48,000 dental procedures and administering nearly 179,000 immunisations and educating 951,000 community members on health matters. The vessel is manned by a dedicated crew of volunteers from more than 21 nations, would you believe, 35 per cent being PNG nationals training on medical care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say, members of the coalition were very impressed. Their request from the Australian government is for $7.5 million only when you think about the volume of services, the primary healthcare outcomes, this couldn't be easier for Australia for us to continue to provide. I ask the Albanese Labor government to give it the proper considerations to sustain this vital humanitarian effort. It's not aid; it's supporting a vital service and a training service between the peoples of Australia, PNG and the world to deliver better primary health care in the region. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:19</span>):  More jobs, higher wages, bigger tax cuts—that's what the Albanese Labor government is delivering for Australia. It's a fact that more jobs have been created under the Albanese Labor government than under any other first-term government on record. ABS figures show that more than 820,000 jobs have been created in our government's first two years. Unemployment remains low at 4.1 per cent, compared to an average of 5.6 per cent under the former government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Higher wages—they are great for families and great for the economy. Our Labor government is proudly, unashamedly, absolutely supportive of higher wages for Australian workers. You will never hear a Labor MP boast that low wages are a deliberate feature of our economic architecture as the Liberals did. Since Labor came to government, the wages of minimum wage earners have increased by $7½ thousand a year—including today's 3.75 per cent increase, which we welcome. And real wages are growing again. Since the 2022 election, nominal wages have been growing at an annualised average of 3.9 per cent, compared to 2.2 per cent under the Liberals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to bigger tax cuts, the figures speak for themselves. On 1 July, our government delivers a tax cut for every Australian taxpayer and a bigger tax cut for most. We're proud of this: more jobs, higher wages, bigger tax cuts.</span>

Noel joined the brigade at 14 as a volunteer firefighter, along with his dad, when the first meeting was held in the local fruit-packing shed. Over the last 75 years, Noel has worked his way up and is in a senior role as a deputy group captain.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Early in his career, Noel was instrumental in securing a building for the station, which the brigade quickly outgrew. Noel then, in typical fashion, led the fundraising every Saturday for a new station, which is still in use today. Known as a trusted and respected crew leader, Noel has travelled to Canberra and Sydney as part of campaigns for the RFS. In his 75th year of service and at the age of 90, Noel is still on call, spends his time doing maintenance and repairs and mentoring other members, and still regularly responds to incidents.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Noel's most memorable achievements including being awarded the national medal with four clasps, the 70th-year RFS long-service medal with five clasps—and, obviously, he's now getting the 75th—and, more recently, the Medal of the Order of Australia. Noel's wife, Betty, along with children Julie and Karen and family celebrated his recent achievements. Noel, thank you on behalf of our community.</span>

This means over $33 more in workers' pockets every week, because we want you to earn more.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This increase means that the minimum wage has risen more under this government in two years than it did under the former government in an entire decade. It means around $140 every week in the pockets of 2.6 million Australian workers on the minimum wage, compared to before we were elected. But then we do recall former senator Mathias Cormann saying the quiet thing out loud and admitting that keeping the wages of Australians low was part of their economic model. So they clearly weren't on the side of wage-earning Australians.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to get wages moving again and, since we were elected, full-time retail workers have more than an extra $102 a week in their pocket; cleaners, $103 more a week; hairdressers, $106 more a week; and aged-care workers, $200 more a week in their pocket. But wait, there's more, because, as of 1 July, every Australian taxpayer will get a tax cut, and, unlike the proposed stage 3 tax cuts under those opposite, the Labor government's tax cuts don't leave behind those on low incomes and those on the minimum wage. Every taxpayer will get a tax cut. Eighty-five per cent of Boothby taxpayers will be better off. This government wants you to earn more and keep more of what you earn.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">War memorials in all forms—Cenotaphs, statues, honour rolls, plaques, armaments, fountains and swimming pools—are found it towns and cities right across Australia. They commemorate all men and women who served our nation in times of war. This includes nurses, national servicemen, peacekeepers and animals. The preservation of these war memorials is of utmost importance for many communities. Currently, not all war memorials are protected by heritage listing, which means they are at risk of removal or demolition.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to establish a Service Memorial Heritage List for all war memorials in Australia to be heritage listed. Memorials would be nominated by local councils to their State or Territory Government, with information including the type of memorial, location, action or service the memorial signifies. To ensure memorials are looked after and cared for into the future, we also ask the House to establish a Service Memorial Heritage Trust Fund. This fund would cover any refurbishments, repairs or upgrades to a memorial, after a time in which members of a theatre or war are no longer capable of tending to a memorial.</span>

The preservation of these war memorials is of the utmost importance for many communities.

Memorials would be nominated by local councils to their State or Territorial Governments, with information including the type of memorial, and action or service the memorial signifies. To ensure memorials are looked after and cared for into the future, we also ask the House to establish a Service Memorial Heritage Trust Fund.

As a Labor government, with our history of creating Australia's remarkable public health system founded on Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, we are working to make health care stronger, easier to access and easier to afford. When you strengthen the health system there's a massive benefit in terms of individual wellbeing, and there are also cost savings. That's why we're providing cheaper medicines, especially for older Australians. That's why we're tripling the bulk-billing incentive, and that's why we're creating a new set of Medicare urgent care clinics right around the country. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because we're always seeking to provide relief now, while making a positive change for the long term, this budget includes some new measures that go specifically to improving key areas of women's health: $49 million to fund longer consultations for complex gynaecological conditions like endometriosis, building on the work we've done to open 22 new endometriosis and pelvic pain clinics; $56 million for new measures to deliver high-quality, tailored maternity care, following recommendations from the participating midwives report; $7 million focused on support for women who have suffered miscarriage and pregnancy loss; and $6 million for outreach health care and crisis accommodation centres for women and children escaping domestic violence. These budget measures are all about improving health care, improving broad community wellbeing, and improving gender equality by making a difference right now and by creating permanent positive change.</span>

Rodney from Redcliffe raised that inflation had increased again in April, when the Prime Minister said it was going down. But it's gone up again, costing everyone more in their hip pocket. Rodney asked: 'Did the Prime Minister mislead the House, or was he careless on his forecasts?' Mala from Scarborough inquired about the current homelessness issue around the country that's been rampant in the last two years and has really gone through the roof since the Albanese Labor government was elected. John from Griffin said: 'My burning question is, what happens when we reach net zero, having spent millions of dollars? Will we get a return on investment?' We'll be speaking on a bill on that today. </span>

This guy had to gall to get up in parliament today and say that direction 99 had actually been good for Australians. The reality is that we've seen the Albanese Labor government let rapists and murderers into the community—and some of those people, after having served a sentence, have gone on to commit further crimes. </span>

The only thing that's down is manufacturing—they've lost 100,000 jobs.</span>

We celebrated 35 years of GTNT employing and supporting thousands of apprentices—in fact, tens of thousands of apprentices—and trainees across the Northern Territory. Congratulations to the category winners: Julian Coburn, Jessica Porter, Thomas Norris II, Steven Budd, Oliver King, Jamil Turpin, Thomas Marsh, Abbe Ayres, Kayla Glynatsis, Elisha Wright, Alec Blundell, Josiah Ross-Kelly, Chloe Quill, and Power and Water Corp, which got the Host Business of the Year award. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:30</span>):  Last week I spoke about housing in my first speech. In the paper today you'll see house prices are still going up, and it's completely a failure of government. Housing new builds have excessively lagged migration, especially my home state of New South Wales and my electorate of Cook. Migration has accounted for 99 per cent of the population growth since COVID, and our population is growing the fastest it has at any time since 1952.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In New South Wales there were 170,000 new immigrants last year for just 47,000 new homes built. This is a recipe for house prices to continue to skyrocket. Whatever way you look at, it as a complete failure of government and there are only two explanations for it: either the Albanese government had no idea this would happen, or they knew it was going to happen but they did it anyway. Either way, this is a damning indictment of this government and its ability to manage house prices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The way to fix it? Start funding states on housing completions. Let's get them competing. New South Wales has taken the lion's share of migration, yet it's had infrastructure funding cut. It also has not been getting its fair share of GST. It takes 37 per cent of the country's migration but only 27 per cent of the GST. It's time for the Albanese government to give Cook and New South Wales its fair share.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:31</span>):  The Filipino community is one of the fastest-growing communities in western Melbourne. There are almost 100,000 people with a Filipino background in Victoria, and that number has increased by 13,000 since the last census. The Filipino Community Council of Victoria Incorporated is based in my electorate and is very active in Fraser. The FCCVI is integral to building a strong Filipino Australian community in Victoria with a range of activities, from organising social events to helping students and workers adjust to Melbourne. It also helps in the delivery of aged-care services and emergency relief.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very pleased to host senior leaders from the FCCVI and other members of the Filipino community in Parliament House earlier this year, when President Marcos Jr delivered an address to a joint sitting. Roxanne Sarthou, the CEO of the FCCVI, is known to everyone in my electorate and her community, and within the Filipino community of course, for her tireless dedication to bringing people together and supporting those in need.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, in the Filippino community's TaxSmart Cafe's Best of the Best awards, in which there were six awards for social entrepreneurialism and leadership, Roxanne received the award for Business Mentor of the Year for her selfless support of others. She has long been building up others in her community to help her in providing critical services for that community. I look forward to the next FCCVI event, to celebrate the 126th Philippine Independence Day. Congratulations again to Roxanne.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Capricornia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:33</span>):  The Central Queensland community celebrated an enormous milestone last month, with the much needed Fitzroy Community Hospice being officially opened. This significant milestone embodies the unwavering dedication and tireless efforts of the Fitzroy Community Hospice board in their mission to fundraise and raise awareness about the critical need for end-of-life care throughout Capricornia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recognising the vital importance of providing compassionate and comprehensive palliative care, the former coalition government made a substantial investment of $8 million. With this investment Fitzroy Community Hospice is now poised to offer much needed community based palliative care to those in need. Situated in Rockhampton, the new 12-bed facility makes a historic development as the first hospice located north of South-East Queensland. The hospice will be staffed by a team of dedicated and highly trained nurses, support staff and volunteers who are committed to delivering holistic end-of-life care.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the direct care provided to patients, the Fitzroy Community Hospice will extend its support to families and caregivers, offering them the necessary resources and guidance to navigate this challenging time. The establishment of the Fitzroy Community Hospice represents significant advancement in the availability of palliative care services in Central Queensland. It stands as the beacon of hope and compassion, ensuring that every individual receives the care and dignity they deserve at the end of life. Congratulations and thank you, Fitzroy Community Hospice, for your services to our community.</span>

The Shine on Awards are an annual Australia-wide Rotary recognition program that acknowledges exceptional service to others by people living with disabilities. It was here that I met Peter Talbot, the president of the Lions Club of Eltham and recipient of the 2023-24 Shine on Award. Peter has committed his life to volunteering in his community despite coping with serious neurological and other health issues caused by birth trauma. Navigating many day-to-day challenges, Peter has held strong to his upbringing, which taught him to believe that community is just an extension of family and that you should always care for each other. Peter has a positive attitude and a belief that no-one should ever be afraid to fail, and that drives him to succeed. He doesn't give up, as shown in his commitment to learn to read and write, which he achieved in his 20s.</span>

We recently celebrated National Volunteer Week 2024, with this year's theme being 'Something for Everyone'. Peter epitomises that very theme. He proves that everyone has something to offer as a volunteer, no matter what your limitations may be, as long as you have the determination to focus on what you can do and not what you can't do.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:36</span>):  My electorate is known for having safe, clean, quiet suburbs. It's a great place to raise a family. In recent months I've been contacted by a number of constituents about the growth in graffiti, particularly along Pennant Hills Road, around the Normanhurst shops, and around Yarrara Road and The Esplanade in Pennant Hills and Thornleigh. Graffiti has become more and more of a concern because it is just sitting there for months at a time. If graffiti is on public land, the council will come and clean it up, as long as it is reported. But, on private land, that's less the case. That's why I'm establishing a graffiti taskforce, a voluntary group in our community to help us clean up our suburbs and keep it as the beautiful set of suburbs that people know it is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's an interesting fact about the reporting of graffiti. Despite these suburbs now being awash with graffiti, the police have said that in the last 12 months only five instances of graffiti have been reported. It's really important that citizens report the graffiti, because that's the best way that police can chase down the tags, upload them to their database and ensure that the people who are engaged in the graffitiing are brought to justice. When graffiti is ignored, it leads to more graffiti and further crime; that's a proven fact. We want to keep our streets safe and clean and we want to keep our suburbs as a great place to raise a family.</span>

But none of these awards would have been possible without the efforts of Dr John Gladstones AM, the widely respected agronomist who in 1965 originally recognised and identified Margaret River's suitability for growing wine grapes, with its conditions similar to those of Bordeaux in France. John worked closely with Vasse Felix's Tom Cullity, who planted the original vines in Margaret River, and the region is now world renowned for its quality vines and is home to around 200 wine producers in the regions. Gladstones also became one of the world's leading authorities on lupins as a crop plant and also bred subterranean clovers.</span>

John has left a remarkable, an enduring and a permanent legacy. Vale, John Gladstones. He was able to pioneer what we've seen in the wonderful Margaret River region and left an indelible mark, and we are intensely grateful for the effort that he put in originally to identify the Margaret River region as one suitable to grow the fabulous wine that is enjoyed around the world.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:40</span>):  I was delighted to recently continue the tradition of Australian MPs visiting Taiwan. I went before the presidential inauguration. Australia and Taiwan are Indo-Pacific democracies, and we continue to build deep and productive unofficial ties with Taiwan, in line with Australia's longstanding One China policy. We have a shared interest in a peaceful and stable region and continue to call for no unilateral change to the status quo across the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan is an important partner for Australia. Our economic and trade ties have only strengthened in recent years. Last financial year, Taiwan was Australia's seventh-largest goods trading partner, at around $40 billion. Taiwan was Australia's sixth-largest goods and services market, at around $30 billion. Two-way services trading increased by more than 80 per cent. Australia is Taiwan's largest energy supplier, providing two-thirds of Taiwan's coal, a third of its natural gas and three-quarters of its iron ore. We coordinate on Pacific development assistance.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, Australia continues to advocate for Taiwan's meaningful participation in international organisations. At the meetings of the World Health Assembly, Australia has called for Taiwan's participation in the World Health Organization. You don't have to be a state, and I encourage all nations to allow this in the interest of the 24 million human beings who live in Taiwan.</span>

The school holds a very special place in our family and many families across the Riverina and indeed the country. On the weekend, the sesquicentenary of the Presentation Sisters' arrival in Wagga Wagga was celebrated. Indeed, Australia owes a great debt of gratitude to those five valiant women who, in early 1874, left the country of their birth, Ireland, to make their way to live on the other side of the world. They were Presentation Sisters who not only made their way to what could almost be described as a frontier town but forged a pathway of education which is a stronghold of schooling to this day. The original sisters were the Reverend Mother Mary Byrne, her sister Mother Mary Xavier Byrne, Mother Mary Stanislaus Dunne, Sister Mary Paul Fay and Mother Mary Evangelist Kelly. What remarkable pioneers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">By the end of 1877, six novices, four from Ireland and two Australians, had joined the original five, and by 1890 the magnificent Mount Erin on the hill had been built. And the rest, as they say, is history. At 64 years young, Sister Bernadette Pattison is the youngest remaining Presentation Sister in the congregation. She said that the weekend celebrations reminded her exactly why she joined the sisterhood 44 years ago. She said:</span>

Indeed, one of the first acts of this government was to restore the much-loved GP Access After Hours service in Newcastle and the Hunter, reinstating the full operational hours of all clinics and reopening the service of the Calvary Mater hospital, which closed under the Morrison government's watch. Labor's investments have made it easier for Novocastrians to see a GP or a nurse after hours and is reducing pressure on local emergency departments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last November, we tripled the bulk-billing incentive for GPs, making trips to the doctor cheaper for those who need it most, and we've opened 58 Medicare urgent care clinics across the country, offering walk-in care seven days a week over extended hours completely bulk-billed. Now we're building on the success of the urgent care clinics with 29 additional clinics announced in the May budget. While no new sites for New South Wales have been announced yet, we know how dire the bulk-billing rates in Newcastle are.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor believes in a future made in Australia. It has become clear over the past few weeks that the Liberals and Nationals do not. A future made in Australia will boost productivity, create secure jobs and build our future prosperity amid global energy transition and industrial transformation. The Liberals' future of manufacturing puts all that at risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike the Liberals, Labor acknowledges and understands the crucial role of manufacturing technology and innovation in delivering this ambition. We don't just turn up to photo opportunities in high-vis like the Liberals do; we actually back industry and workers with good policy, funding and a vision. Our vision for manufacturing in Australia involves renewable energy, critical minerals, onshore processing and helping the world decarbonise. To that end, in the budget we have boosted the Australian Renewable Energy Agency with a $5.1 billion investment. This includes $1.7 billion for the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund, which aims to unlock private capital for new industries such as green metals and low-carbon liquid fuels. Additionally, $1.5 billion is dedicated to kickstarting domestic manufacturing in solar and battery industries, ensuring that Australia not only consumes but produces key renewable energy technologies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To do all this, we need to ensure that we have a skilled workforce. We're investing $91 million to turbocharge training and apprenticeships in the clean energy sector, because, without a local workforce, we will not meet our potential. Our investments in a future made in Australia aim to secure Australia's energy future and enhance our international competitiveness. By investing strategically in renewable energy technologies and infrastructure, we are positioning Australia as a global leader in the clean energy sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To decarbonise the world, we'll also need green hydrogen for energy intensive industries. To that end, we are building on the $2 billion Hydrogen Headstart program by establishing a new hydrogen production tax incentive. This manufacturing tax incentive will provide a $2-per-kilogram rebate for each kilogram of renewable hydrogen produced. These incentives will drive innovation and investment, making Australia a leader in green hydrogen production and export. Under Labor, in two years, thousands of new jobs have been created. We are seeing more renewable energy in our grid, and we are well on the way to becoming the renewable energy superpower that we have the potential to be. Our nation is rich in critical minerals such as lithium, cobalt and rare earth elements, which are essential for producing batteries, electric vehicles and other clean energy technologies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike those opposite, we don't just want to dig up things out of the ground and shift them offshore. We want to make things here. We want to make batteries here. We want to make solar panels here. While the Liberals and Nationals ridicule our ambition, we back our workers and our ingenuity to make it happen. Australia can supply the world with solar panels. We invented the technology, and we have all the minerals we need to make them. The same goes for batteries. Global demand for batteries is set to quadruple by 2030 as the world transitions to net zero. On batteries, we will focus on high-value battery products in Australia's area of competitive advantage, including manufacturing energy storage systems for renewable grids, providing battery-active materials to the world and supplying batteries to our transport manufacturing industry, including heavy vehicle manufacturing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our vision is clear: a reliable and renewable future made in Australia. We believe in our ingenuity and our workforce to seize these immense economic opportunities. Contrast Labor's vision for a future made in Australia—anchored in renewable energy, batteries, solar and green hydrogen—to the backwards, denialist position of the Liberals and Nationals. Let's never forget that they were a government that chased manufacturing offshore. They dared our auto industry to leave, and then they were shocked when it did. They are the parties that ridiculed rail workers in New South Wales and shipbuilders in South Australia. They talked them down and said that things couldn't be made here. With their record as it is, is it any surprise that they oppose a future made in Australia? They will line up here with every excuse under the sun to oppose our plan to build more things here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With a future made in Australia, the choice is very clear. Labor wants to harness our resources and expertise to build a sustainable and prosperous future for all Australians, and the Liberals will just oppose it. We back our workers to transform and grow our economy, and it's only a Labor government that can achieve it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:50</span>):  The motion put forward by the member for Bennelong is commendable, but he is very short-sighted in the approach he has taken in addressing the issues facing a future made in Australia. Let's go through them. It's a shame he's leaving the Chamber. If you're going to put one of these motions, you really should stay to listen to others and to proffer arguments to help the speakers who will follow you. Anyway, he will probably learn in relation to that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Labor were last in office, they promised $6.2 billion to keep car manufacturing in Australia, claiming it would leverage $16 billion in investment and secure jobs throughout the 2020s. But what did they deliver? The facts show that 20,500 jobs in motor vehicle and component manufacturing were lost under Labor. At major manufacturers, vehicle production fell by more than 36 per cent between 2007 and 2012—Labor years. Conveniently lost on Labor is that Mitsubishi and Ford announced they would leave the Australian market on Labor's watch. They conveniently forget or overlook that. Across Labor's last term in office, 6,800 manufacturing businesses closed their doors, and more than 37,300 manufacturing jobs were lost in their last year in office alone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We see now, under a Labor government, record numbers of small businesses going to the wall—going bankrupt. They can't keep the door open. This is such a shame, and there are a number of factors in that, not least of which is the higher power prices. They just can't seem to pay the bills, and why would they be able to pay the bills when Labor, having promised prior to the May 2022 election that they would cut power prices, have done the complete opposite when it comes to ensuring lower power prices for households, for small businesses and, indeed, for manufacturing?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, when we talk about 'made in Australia' on this WA Day, we look at Labor's record with Western Australia. Their failures on borders and migration mean that that it's harder to buy a house and less safe to walk the streets in WA. But worse than that in one sense is that they are shutting down our live sheep export industry. When introducing the Export Control Amendment (Ending Live Sheep Exports by Sea) Bill 2024, the member for Ballarat, a regional member, said this:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We all know Australians love their lamb, and now the rest of the world is catching on with demand for lamb and mutton products continuing to grow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If that's the case, why would you shut down an industry which is made right here in Australia, with sheep produced right here in Australia, and why would the Treasurer go to the dispatch box, in delivering his third budget, and pay $107 million to Australian farmers to stop farming? That's what he's doing: he's paying $107 million to stop sheep farmers in Western Australia from doing what they are good at—what they are the world's best at. Our Australian farmers—make no mistake—are the best in the world. But here we have a Labor government saying that it's going to protect Australian industries, preserve Australian jobs and grow industry and, at the same time, the budget puts in $107 million to shut down an industry which provides world's best practice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Bennelong talked about critical minerals. I'm not quite sure how many critical minerals there are in the seat of Bennelong, but I have plenty of critical minerals in my electorate of Riverina, particularly around Forbes. Northparkes mine does a great job, as does Lake Cowal mining operations. But we have seen a government which doesn't mind taking the benefits and talking about how they're getting the budget back into surplus when, at the same time, they are shutting down mining operations throughout regional Australia—shutting down the very industries which are helping to keep our balance of payments and export opportunities alive and well and helping make sure their budget stays in balance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is so incongruous when on one hand they're taking and, on the other hand, they are absolutely demonising the industries and therefore the workers in those industries, who are doing their very best and have done for many, many years to keep the nation's lights on. Shame on Labor for that. Shame on Labor for pretending to care about a future made in Australia, when exactly the opposite is the case.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KHALIL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:55</span>):  I say to the Chamber: we care. We care about a future made in Australia. I want to acknowledge the member for Bennelong for moving this motion for this very important topic. The Future Made in Australia plan is going to turbocharge our clean manufacturing, our industry and energy output and our capabilities. It's about time we did something like this, because we had 10 years of neglect on this matter and even before that: decisions like cutting support for auto manufacturing and then smoking cigars in celebration about it. How many of the industries that supported auto manufacturing have gone to the wall—all the small and medium sized engineering companies, all the innovation, all the skills outside of the factories themselves and the workers that worked in those factories? That's what the record of the previous coalition government was all about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For them to come in here and criticise the Future Made in Australia plan is pretty rich. By supporting Australian businesses and fostering innovation, we're going to build that robust economy that ensures a prosperous future filled with job opportunities, creating jobs made right here in Australia. This will boost our economy, create jobs and deliver for our environment. All of these objectives are what we are aiming at to transition Australia towards net zero.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we talk about renewables and the target of 82 per cent national renewable electricity generation by 2030, that's so critical. We're squarely focused on the path to clean-energy supply chains, where it's in our national interest to make things here and where we can be competitive. Supply chain resilience and security is absolutely critical in the current environment that we face, with geostrategic volatility and supply chain issues, which we saw during COVID. So this is also about economic security, national security and prosperity for Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen a 25 per cent increase in renewables in the national electricity market since we came to office. We know that global energy supply chains have been under enormous pressure in recent years. Global demand for batteries is set to quadruple by 2030 as we transition to net zero. The government knows that we can't rely on the status quo, which is why we have invested and continue to invest billions of dollars in solar, clean hydrogen and the National Battery Strategy and $1 billion to establish the Solar Sunshot to capture more of the global solar manufacturing supply chain with production credits and grants.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian research invented the modern solar panel, yet only one per cent of the panels on Australian roofs are made here. That's going to change. A Future Made in Australia is about creating jobs and increasing economic resilience and energy security in this space. On hydrogen, we're investing $6.7 billion over the decade for a new production tax incentive of $2 per kilogram starting from 2027-28 and $2 billion for a new round of the successful Hydrogen Headstart program. This investment's going to give industry the certainty and the confidence to advance projects here in Australia, accelerating the development of Australia's renewable hydrogen industry. It's going to give long-term certainty for the large-scale renewable hydrogen industry that's critical for future green iron and steel opportunities. We're expecting that it's going to create in regional and remote areas, which we heard the previous speaker going on about, 33,000 direct and indirect jobs and produce $28.9 billion per annum by 2040.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what Labor does. We provide jobs. We create jobs. We drive economic stability and innovation, and we work in partnership with scientists, with environmentalists, with engineers and with manufacturers. That's why Labor is the only party of government who can actually deliver, rather than grandstand, on this transition to net zero. We've got a National Battery Strategy, which is going to be set up and world leading, harnessing the world's leading expertise in battery technology, and we've got a STEM future. The Future Made in Australia plan is informed by our biggest, brightest minds in research. Unlike the coalition, Labor is going to nurture our research and development ecosystem, because STEM professionals are so important for the future.</span>

We are committed to harnessing these opportunities through innovation, investment and a steadfast commitment to our future. We're going to continue to drive the Future Made in Australia agenda. We're going to drive that agenda hard because it ensures that our economy, environment and communities can thrive in the decades to come. Labor will lead Australia into a new era of prosperity and build a future every Australian can be a part of.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:00</span>):  A future made in Australia—I admire the desire, but I think the policy won't achieve anything. In fact, it will exacerbate the problem which has caused Australian manufacturing to exit the country. Giving money away to approve more renewable energy projects of national significance is exactly what's happening already. The regulators in the state of Queensland have changed it so that any renewable project doesn't have to comply with any environmental law. Under state code 23, one just has to put in an application to the local council's CEO and—hey presto!—it doesn't even go to a council vote; it gets approved. New South Wales has an expedited process already. I'm not sure if the other states do, but, judging by the plans that have been approved that are out of <span style="font-style:italic;">Utopia</span>, I suspect they have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Renewable Energy Agency has been around since the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd times. The time for us to be investing in renewable energy was when there were nascent technologies at the University of New South Wales. That boat sailed decades ago. If you'd said, 'There's a clever scientist over at UNSW who's got this thing; they're going to make direct current out of panels, and you just put them under the sun,' anyone with any insight would have realised it was great and invested early—whereas the world is now awash with solar panels. The price of them has dropped 40 per cent because China is flooding the world with them. They've even undercut the Europeans. There are a few tokenistic small-scale producers left but—hey presto! It's a forlorn hope that we can get a new person or a new business with the aid of maybe a billion dollars of capital as a grant to compete in the marketplace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When push comes to shove, price matters, and people will buy the cheapest as long as the product is reasonably good. The Chinese have got the supply chains stitched up. Even though we mine more lithium than most other countries put together, it all goes to China. We want to keep a lot of our rare earth minerals here—sure. I think keeping and processing our raw minerals sounds like a really good idea. That's what we do well. But Tomago Aluminium, Portland Aluminium and Alcoa, which shut in the Hunter Valley years ago—why did they shut? Because the biggest input is not the bauxite and the alumina; it is electricity. That's why they shut up shop and left.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a story often quoted about all of the car making that left Australia. I was really sad when it left, but, if you look at the records, Chrysler Valiant left in the eighties, followed by Leyland and BMC. Ford announced their closure in May 2013 before the coalition was even elected.</span>

That was the only one. It was one company. All the others made their decisions years ago. As it turns out, Ford made their announcement in 2013, but we convinced them that they were competitive and to stay, and they decided to keep their design team. Many members would not know that the Ford design team based in Melbourne designs four-wheel drives for Ford around the world. Even the big monster trucks and Ford Rangers are designed in Australia, but they're built in Vietnam, Thailand or elsewhere.</span>

I have 1,200 people at Tomago who can see the writing on the wall: when their current energy contract ends, Tomago will close. It's pie in the sky to think that 24-hour electricity that is required to run that smelter will be produced regularly enough and at sufficient volumes if we keep closing our power stations. We have to keep it there. More renewables is not the solution. They will have a part in our grid, but, if we're going to get out of coal— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:05</span>):  'A future made in Australia'—this is more than a headline. This is something that is in the blood of this government, and we're working every day to achieve that. I commend the member for Bennelong for bringing this wonderful motion to the House. I strongly support this motion because I believe in a future made in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The global economy is changing, and we need to secure Australia's place in it. We need to act urgently so that Australia is not left behind. Labor has embraced the challenge, unlike the previous government—years of inaction, neglect and wasted opportunities. And let's face it: the pathway to net zero emissions goes right through WA. Under the Liberals, manufacturing ground to a halt. It's astonishing that Australia procures 68 per cent of what we use. This has put Australia in last place in the OECD. 'Self-sufficiency' was not in the vocabulary of the Liberal Party. In two years, Labor has made enormous progress to put measures in place to turn this around.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's focus is on securing a future for Australia. The Liberals had no focus. I expect the opposition will oppose this motion because that's all that they know how to do. There is a policy vacuum on that side of the House. They say no to anything; they say no to everything. They say no to creating a better future for Australia, and they say no to creating a future made in Australia, because they've got nothing else to offer. Instead Labor has supercharged investment in renewable hydrogen. There is $6.7 billion over a decade for new production tax incentives and $2 billion in the new round of the successful Hydrogen Headstart program. We're expanding funding for the Critical Minerals Facility to $6 billion, and we're establishing a $1.7 billion Future Made in Australia innovation fund. We've established Solar Sunshot to capture more of the global solar manufacturing supply chain, with more production credits worth about $1 billion. That is not just an example; this is something that the Labor government is doing to supercharge our clean energy future and increase the capacity of our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Bennelong includes in his motion a commendation for further actions this government is taking to secure Australia's future. There's one that I'm super thrilled about. I'm passionate about STEM: science, technology, engineering and maths. I'm passionate about STEM because investment in STEM will build a future made in Australia. I'm also passionate about more diversity in STEM. We need more women to make STEM more representative in this country. Diversity is a strength. This is something that we learn in ecology and biology, but it applies to the parliament and also to our workforces. Diversity will mean better outcomes for all Australians. New methods of research, new explanations, new ideas and new perspectives will help us find different pathways to solving complex problems. I think this is really exciting, and we need to see that the diversity that we've seen in the 47th Parliament happens in our workplaces where we have STEM professionals. I applaud the government for investing $38.2 million over eight years for diversity in STEM programs. This funding will mean existing STEM programs that focus on women and science engagement will receive additional funding. This is what we need to do to reach more diverse cohorts and encourage them into STEM careers and to stay in those careers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also interesting to see what we're doing in the renewable technology space. As we said, the global economy is changing and we can either be left behind or be a part of it. There is an advantage in making sure we are not the laggards, and we need to make sure we do this so we can actually make progress, make financial contributions and have financial success with our investment in renewable energy and our pathway to net zero emissions. It's something that will result in better investment in Australia, but it's something that Western Australia will particularly benefit from. I think we all agree that we need to see action on climate change, but we also need to see the sophistication of the Australian economy increase, and that's what the Future Made in Australia plan will do. I commend this motion to the House.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:11</span>):  It's wonderful to rise and speak on this motion, although I was a little bit perplexed when I read through it. I made sure I read the motion about the government's Future Made in Australia plan in great detail. I thought: 'Surely they would want to talk about the $466.4 million that they spent on their National Quantum Strategy. That's a big part of their Future Made in Australia plan, but it's not mentioned.' Those opposite don't want to talk about their Quantum Strategy as part of the Future Made in Australia plan. There are a few reasons why they don't want to talk about PsiQuantum and they don't want to talk about their Quantum Strategy under the Future Made in Australia banner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first reason they don't want to talk about it is that it's not made in Australia; it's a Silicon Valley company. This government is giving $466.4 million to a US tech company based in Silicon Valley under the Future Made in Australia banner. But it gets worse. There are serious question marks over the EOI process that was undertaken to come to this grant. In November last year I stood in this Chamber and raised concerns, which were raised with me by the quantum sector, about the process. They were concerned that the EOI process was reverse-engineered to support PsiQuantum. They were concerned because they'd seen an email from PsiQuantum to potential investors talking about their agreement with the Australian government in April and May 2023. I raised this concern in November 2023. Lo and behold, on 30 April 2024 the government announced their $466.4 million for this US based company. What a coincidence!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And let's look at the timeline. In December 2022, the federal Minister for Industry and Science, Ed Husic, met with PsiQuantum. On 25 January 2023, Minister Husic travelled to the US to visit PsiQuantum. Conveniently, on 26 April 2023, PsiQuantum miraculously registered in Australia—based in Brisbane. What a coincidence. On 3 May, Minister Husic released his National Quantum Strategy. From 1 to 31 August, a quantum computing EOI was issued by the federal government. This was all happening in May and August last year, when this email was floating around. I then raised it in this House in November last year, and, lo and behold, on 30 April 2024 the government miraculously announced this money for PsiQuantum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it gets better. Last year Brookline Advisory started working as a lobbyist for PsiQuantum. Who are two of the key lobbyists who work for Brookline Advisory? Would you believe, Member for Herbert, that they're former staffers for the Treasurer and the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia? They were appointed on 12 May last year. So it is no wonder that those opposite don't want to put any mention of this Quantum Strategy in this motion, because they know this process doesn't stack up. Senate estimates last week showed that the contracts have not been signed. It is still going through the department because it doesn't stack up. What this government did was choose to pick a winner. They put it all on black, put it all on one US based technology company. What they should have done is follow the UK model and undertake a testbed strategy. A testbed strategy in quantum allows you to invest in multiple technologies. Because let's be clear, there is no proven quantum technology; all of these are options they are working through. We don't know whether PsiQuantum will work or not. There are other quantum companies working on different technologies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;">
                  </span>The smart decision when you invest is to diversify. But no, this government and this minister in his wisdom chose one US company to spend $466.4 million of Australia taxpayer money on. He abandoned the quantum industry in Australia, left them with nothing. That is why governments should not be picking winners; it's because they conveniently support companies that their former staffers work for. This is just one example of why this Future Made in Australia strategy is going to continue to fail and cost taxpayer money. <span style="font-style:italic;">(</span><span style="font-style:italic;">T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ime expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's now a number of years in this place that we've been talking about our nation's strategic challenges. It's widely accepted that Australia is facing the most complex of strategic challenges since the end of the Second World War. It was a finding of the Defence Strategic Review and one which the coalition supports. That is why I brought this motion before parliament today. If we are really at risk of facing a conflict within the next decade, if the 10-year window of warning has really passed then the Albanese Labor government has a lot of work to do when it comes to growing our sovereign industrial base.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A robust sovereign defence industrial base in this country is absolutely critical to our national security. We need the guardrails in place to ensure that if the worst were to happen that we are not over reliant on our international partners. We know how difficult it can be when supply chains are affected by unexpected interruptions. We saw this during the pandemic with masks and vaccines and we are seeing it in the Red Sea right now. We know how difficult it can be if we don't have enough of a skilled workforce to deliver the labour we need across a range of industries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Defence is not immune to these factors; in fact, it can be argued that it is even more exposed. That has only become even more of a concern due to last two years of inaction by the weak leadership of the Albanese Labor government. Let's have a look at what the government has done thus far. Well, they commissioned a review and produced a report called the Defence Industry Development Strategy. This report has sought to provide a new definition for our sovereign industrial base, one which needs to move beyond the narrow lens of solar-using Australian owned businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know not everything can be produced by Australian owned companies but what is the new definition of Australian sovereign defence industrial base according to this report? It is businesses with an Australian based industrial capability with an Australian business number. That's basically it. If you have an ABN, you are sovereign. Deputy Speaker Georganas, do you know who has an ABN? Huawei, Hikvision, companies we have banned from providing certain products to the government because of security concerns. As Michael Shoebridge said, it means Northrop Grumman is as sovereign as Bega cheese and Vegemite. Northrop Grumman is an American company. How do we think this looks to a 100 per cent Australian owned sovereign company that exists to provide capability to the Department of Defence?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The former coalition government made it a priority to invest in companies which were taking this seriously with the sovereign industrial capability priority grants. This was for small-to-medium enterprises to assist them to invest in projects to build our sovereign capability. The program was axed by the Albanese Labor government, and we're still waiting on details of a replacement program. So that's a gap in time and an opportunity missed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, in the meantime, the government could be doing so much more to make it easier for SMEs to work with the Department of Defence. The motion before the Chamber mentions agile market intelligence research commissioned by Defence Connect, which doesn't paint a good picture. There's a lack of confidence and a lack of clarity when it comes to Australian businesses working for Defence. Only one in four defence businesses are confident their existing or upcoming contracts would continue as planned over the next 12 months. Sixty-four per cent of small businesses believe it is extremely difficult to operate in Australia's defence sector. Forty-eight per cent of medium enterprises also believe the sector is difficult or extremely difficult to operate in. I'm disappointed to say that it's something I've heard echoed in Townsville, Australia's largest garrison city. I've got a veteran owned and operated sovereign business that have supplied amazing capabilities to Defence that have pulled out. They're sick of roadblocks, they're sick of the red tape and they're sick of indecision. It sounds a lot like this Labor government's approach to defence in general.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">With a threat imminent, we must be doing better. We need to see Australian companies with their headquarters and operations here and a government that implements policy to build our industrial self-reliance, because what we're seeing now is that this is not occurring. We should have business confidence within our defence industry sector. We don't have it. We don't have a defence industry minister who speaks to the defence industry, and he doesn't show up to Land Forces—doesn't show up when he needs to be counted. I commend this motion to the House.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LAWRENCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:21</span>):  The complex set of security and strategic challenges that the member for Herbert refers to are well outlined in the Defence Strategic Review, which the Albanese government commissioned early in its term and which was released publicly in April last year. Conveniently, the same Minister for Defence who commissioned the review is also overseeing its implementation. The coalition, of course, had altogether too many ministers for defence and, for that reason and others, were unable to provide proper guidance to the defence department or to the defence industry for many years. Was Scott Morrison also the Minister for Defence? I can't actually remember, given there were 23 different members in the role.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We expected the coalition to be pretty hopeless across a wide range of portfolio areas. We're busy fixing immigration, the NDIS, aged care, education and others, but, really, we would prefer if they weren't hopeless on defence. One recommendation of the Defence Strategic Review—the member will find it on page 81—is that Australia should rapidly establish a domestic guided weapons and explosive ordnance manufacturing capability. 'Rapidly establish' are hard words, the coalition would know, given that they let 28 major defence contracts run, cumulatively, 97 years late. So 'rapidly' has meaning in this space.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 8 May 2023, Air Marshal Leon Phillips OAM was appointed as the inaugural Chief of Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance in order to initiate the GWEO Enterprise. To date, it has, among other actions, accelerated the acquisition of guided weapons, agreed with the US to deep cooperation on Australia's GWEO Enterprise by collaborating on a flexible guided weapons production capability in Australia by 2025 and invested $220 million into munitions factories at Mulwala and Benalla in Victoria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following on from the DSR, the Defence Industry Development Strategy sets out a plan for the future of our defence industry and the creation of a far more robust sovereign and economically significant defence industry in Australia. It describes the rationale for greater sovereign manufacturing and treats procurement reform and, importantly, workforce challenges and solutions. Commentators have noted that the DIDS also devotes a whole chapter to communication, and it's good to see this acknowledged as an issue within defence and an area where cultural change and improvement can occur.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In technology, the government has committed at least $3.6 billion over the coming decade for the Advanced Strategic Capabilities Accelerator to ensure that Australia has speedy access to proven defence related technologies and to keep us at the cutting edge. The DSR also stressed the importance of naval shipbuilding as a sovereign industrial capability. It recommended a commitment to continuous naval shipbuilding. The DIDS supported this, and in November we were very pleased to see Minister Conroy announce continuous naval shipbuilding at Henderson in Western Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Upon making that announcement, the minister stressed that continuous shipbuilding would allow companies to make investments and would underpin what is already a skilled workforce to stay in the industry and for that workforce to grow. The minister described it as a 'seismic' announcement, and I know it was appreciated by the WA Minister for Defence Industry, the Hon. Paul Papalia, and by my colleague the member for Fremantle, who has advocated on this for his community for many years. It will be appreciated even more by the workers and families involved and by the companies that can rely on a steady stream of work there to underpin that investment. Continuity allows for much more than just output and employment. It allows for planning and onshore maintenance and for the building of a skills base that can be relied upon in difficult times. Continuity is also essential for the developing business and investor confidence. This motion in fact speaks of confidence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Confidence is an interesting thing. It's hard to have confidence in a coalition that pops up a different face into defence portfolios whenever the wind changes. Let me tell you what I know about business and investor confidence: nothing shakes confidence so badly as a sudden, abrupt and unexpected change to a contract worth hundreds of billions of dollars. When Scott Morrison suddenly pulled the rug out from under the French, it meant that the companies in Australia that had been busily investing in their own capacity to get ready for that deal and the part that they could play in it faced huge, real losses. I've spoken to people in the defence industry about this in my electorate and outside of it. So, 'I don't think; I know.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Confidence is supported by clear goals which the Defence Strategic Review, the DIDS and the recent National Defence Strategy provide. This motion calls upon the government to urgently implement a policy framework and industry support to build our industrial self-reliance. Well, that's all happening, and it's good to have the member onboard.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249308" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PRICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Durack</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:27</span>):  One of the most important lessons learnt by Australia during COVID is that our nation must continue to strengthen our manufacturing capability. We must be able to make what our nation requires and not rely upon others in the event that our borders are closed. Although the Morrison government already knew this from a defence perspective, the consequences of COVID were a stark reminder that we must be able to build at home to defend our home. During my three years as the Minister for Defence Industry, this became my mantra. Throughout this period there was a much greater emphasis on what areas of sovereign industrial defence capability Australia should be focusing its efforts on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also determined that our men and women in uniform would have what they needed to do their job. Another of my priorities was to make sure that our Australian defence industry companies knew that we knew how important they were to the defence of our nation. I was determined to make culture change within the department so that when a new bit of the defence gear was required—and that happens often—a procurement manager didn't simply order it from an overseas supplier. In a relatively short space of time, together with industry partners and the Department of Defence, we achieved some remarkable feats. Not all these achievements got media attention—they didn't have their names up in lights—but they were important steps; indeed, they were important tools for securing a sovereign defence industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For example: we established the Australian Industry Content Division within CASG; we delivered a new mandated contracting model for Australian industry capability and content; we built a workforce through programs like the new and highly successful Defence Industry Pathways Program, which is currently running in Western Australia, and the expanded SADI program; we supported defence innovation, not just with words but with funding as well; and we created the Office of Defence Industry Support. We also created the AIC audit program, making sure we were holding the prime contractors to account. We made changes to the Commonwealth Procurement Rules, making it much easier for smaller defence industry companies to get their first foot on the defence ladder. And we established the Defence Industry Secondment Program. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what has happened since then under Prime Minister Albanese's watch? Ask yourself: does our Australian defence industry have faith and confidence in its current government? Agile Market Intelligence's <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia</span><span style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">defence </span><span style="font-style:italic;">industry report</span> for the 2024 financial year, commissioned by Defence Connect, paints a very concerning picture. Indeed, for myself, I think it's a very heartbreaking picture that has been painted. It found a whopping 47 per cent of defence businesses believe it is 'difficult' or 'extremely difficult' to operate in Australia's defence sector, including 64 per cent of small businesses and 48 per cent of medium enterprises. Forty-nine per cent of defence businesses believe it is 'difficult' or 'extremely difficult' to attract and retain staff in the current environment. Only one in four—some 25 per cent—of defence businesses are 'extremely confident' or 'very confident' that their existing or upcoming contracts will continue as planned over the next 12 months. I mean, honestly, how can you plan your business when you have such lack of confidence? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What did industry proponents have to say? They said: 'There is a lack of confidence in timing of contract awards, making it very difficult to attract and retain staff and key suppliers. The Defence Strategic Review is not funded, and there is no funding in the forward estimates. This reduces confidence and the ability for Defence to execute awards. The DSR has resulted in complete decision paralysis within the Department of Defence and CASG.' It's not a very good resume, is it? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under a Dutton led coalition government we will not be waiting around to invest in defence. We're all about restoring trust in our Australian defence industry. We have done it before and we are determined to do it again. We will beef up our industrial capabilities and we will help to rebuild our small and medium-sized businesses to make sure that we have what it takes to defend ourselves. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is imperative that our defence industry has confidence in its government in order to take risks on defence contracts. This is urgent. War in the next decade is possible. The risk of conflict is ever present. We are hearing tough talk from those opposite, but I tell you what: words will just not cut it. On Labor's current projections, we cannot expect any new defence capability over the decade. This is why I am passionate about there being clarity around our strategic circumstances—a clear strategy to deter those who will do us harm. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:32</span>):  This motion does get one thing right, and that is that we are indeed facing the most challenging strategic circumstances since the Second World War. That's one thing the member for Herbert got right in his motion. What it completely misses is that you don't defend our national interest or support our domestic defence industry with stunts and press releases, but that's exactly what those opposite did when they were in government for 10 years. You do not build a viable defence industry by announcing projects and then not funding them, by letting defence projects run off the rails or by treating the portfolio like a prize to reward your political mates, but that's exactly what those opposite did when in government. They racked up $42 billion worth of spending commitments without adding a single dollar to the defence budget. It beggars belief. They let 28 major defence projects run cumulatively more than 97 years late. They had 23 defence ministers and assistant ministers—even the member for Herbert will get a go—in the defence portfolio in nine years. That's a lot: 23 in nine years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What supports a viable local defence industry is hard work—working methodically to get our strategic settings right, matching it with viable defence capability plans, backing it up with real money and having a practical plan to give Australian defence industry and workers a go. That's exactly what our government has done, and the facts back it up. The ABS has said that in 2022-23, the first year of this government, Australian defence industry grew by over four per cent and provided $10.6 billion to the Australian economy. The number of people employed in defence industry also grew by six per cent, meaning that, in totality, defence industry now supports over 100,000 jobs. We have signed the single largest defence export in Australia's history, exporting over 100 Australian built Boxer vehicles, valued at $3.1 billion, and securing over 600 direct jobs in Queensland alone. That's an example of how we're creating a future made in Australia. Meanwhile those opposite tried to undermine this deal with a media release claiming it was dead—shame.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have brought forward the delivery of Army's landing craft medium by a number of years so they start arriving from 2026. That's an example of how we're showing that we understand the strategic circumstances required for bringing forward such projects. We've also brought forward delivery of Army's landing craft heavy from the mid-2030s to 2028. We've announced more investment in Australian industry to further develop Ghost Bat, the first military combat aircraft designed and manufactured in Australia in more than 50 years. That's another significant thing that we've done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also delivered a practical, clear and focused plan to support Australian defence industry and workers. On 29 February, the Minister for Defence Industry launched the Defence Industry Development Strategy. It's always good to have a strategy. This critical document outlines the strategic rationale for a sovereign defence industrial base and clearly outlines the actions the government will take to grow the industrial base that we need. The DIDS outlines a total investment of $183.8 million in funding for defence industry grants programs and provides clarity on the priority areas for defence to a level that is actually meaningful for industry. We're also making it much easier for business to work with defence. A critical element of this is procurement reform. By speeding up procurement processes, we not only make it easier for industry to work with defence but we also make it more cost effective. Do you know what else provides certainty for defence industry? Telling industry there is $330 billion for defence capability investment, which we have done in the recently released 2024 Integrated Investment Program, or IIP. This represents an additional $5.7 billion of investment over the next four years and $50.3 billion over the next decade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are committed to growing our defence industry, while those opposite have been committed only to relentless negativity about what is clearly an effective and always growing approach that we have to funding our defence capability. Those opposite will see that, and they'll see that, as we've racked up budget surpluses, we've been able to put additional funds into capability, which those opposite could never do. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr PEARCE:</span>
                  </a>  We on this side take it a little more seriously. As I was saying, I enlisted in the Australian Regular Army at the end of the Cold War. In the 20 years of service that I gave to this country and the years since, I've never seen a more dangerous geopolitical strategic environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This environment requires decisive, deliberate, lethal capability to deter our adversaries and to defend our citizens. There's a Latin phrase we use in the military: 'Si vis pacem, para bellum.' That means, 'If one desires peace, then one should prepare for war.' Sadly, this defence budget won't drop money into our defence budget for a number of years. An example comes from my electorate of Braddon in north-west Tasmania where Elphinstone Manufacturing Group are the subprime for Hanwha, who are the successful tenderers for the Land 400 and Land 8116 mobile 155-millimetre howitzer program. Mr Elphinstone tells me he has been frustrated for many years. We initially gave him the indication that he was to build 450 of these hulls right in Tasmania to the highest tolerances. Over the length of that, which is 7.77 metres, he was allowed one millimetre. There are 40 thousandths of an inch to a millimetre, so those are very fine tolerances. He subsequently invested hundreds of thousands of dollars into gearing up to meet those tolerances, and subsequently, as soon as this lot got in, that 450 number was cut to 129, after that investment had already been made by that manufacturer. It is not good enough. He's got to run a business and employ people, and he needs to meet that capability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard a lot from the other side and, in fact, from many experts—we agree—that missile defence and force projection will underpin our effectiveness as we move forward. I recently visited Israel, and we started looking at the Iron Dome and the David's Sling technology that they have in that country. If they didn't have that, it wouldn't be the case that 99 per cent of those missiles are destroyed in the air, and those missiles not destroyed would hit their targets and destroy Israel's population.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We see manufacturers like Kongsberg, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin again being delayed in their process as they move forward and develop technologies which are aimed at the Australian Defence Force. But, at the end of all this, I look at the recruiting numbers and at the young people of Australia who aren't going into the recruiting office, are being delayed in the recruiting office, are not meeting the requirements for enlistment or are not getting into our training establishments quickly enough. We are going to need a very technical workforce. Make no mistake. If we can't get those young men and women into their Defence Force as quickly as possible then there will be no-one to drive these fancy pieces of equipment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue that I look at is what we call the C4ISR, the command, control, communications and computers necessary to drive this equipment and the intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance requirements, or sensor-to-shooter requirements, that we need to aim these sensitive technical pieces of equipment onto our targets, given the size of our area of operations in the Indo-Pacific region. This is where the money needs to be spent: in the command and control aspects. I think this has been forgotten, along with those who are operating these pieces of equipment, and I call on this government, who should have done something a long time ago, to rectify the shortfalls in recruiting. They are flat-footed when it comes to having operators for this equipment. Overall, it's not good enough. We are heading for even more dangerous times, and I suggest that this government really get on with things, because we are, as I said, extremely flat-footed.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:42</span>):  I'd like to thank the member for Herbert for moving this motion in private members' business today. Given that he is a few days shy of three months in the role of shadow assistant minister for defence industry, it is only natural to expect him to come into this place to speak on all things defence industry. I would like to hope that his colleagues armed him with the facts necessary to litigate such a motion on the subject matter, which was until quite recently—along with defence and foreign affairs, to name a few—deemed to be above partisanship.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the member comes into this place moving a motion referencing a survey, making it his sole evidence that the vibes are off. The shadow assistant minister comes into this place keenly displaying his L-plates when it comes to getting across his brief on defence industry. He is either keenly unaware of or oblivious to the big Ls that his former government took on defence industry policy across nine long years. The member gets a few things right with this motion. Australia is facing the most complex set of strategic challenges since the end of the Second World War. However, based on a cursory vibe check of my own, it is fair to say that bringing a motion such as this into this place demonstrates the opposition's tactics team is facing the most complex set of strategic challenges in quite some time too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Much like one of the cornerstones of our government's 2024 National Defence Strategy, the opposition have taken a leaf out of that book and leaned heavily into a strategy of denial. This strategy especially extends to their ability to acknowledge any problems from those opposite that the Albanese government had to address in any area of policy, including defence industry, and it especially denies any part our government has played in seeing this industry grow and thrive in the immediate term and policies that we have put in place since day one that are working toward the long-term growth and sustainability of defence industry decades into the future.</span>

              </a>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BURNELL:</span>
                  </a>  I will get to that in a minute, Member for Durack. This strategy is not always shared by the shadow minister for defence and the shadow minister for defence industry, the member for Canning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Herbert should take note of the member for Canning's candour as he was, after all, someone who served as one of the many assistant ministers for defence during the previous government. Even the member for Canning, as assistant minister, during that time acknowledged he saw a great deal of waste when it came to defence industry and procurement. The member for Canning also acknowledged the damage caused in this vital area of policy by a revolving door of leadership changes and constant reshuffling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The timing of the member for Herbert's motion is also curious. According to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>, notice of this motion was given on 14 May, once more flexing the opposition's blanket strategy of denial, demonstrating this wholeheartedly by calling on the government to implement a policy framework and industry support to build self-reliance within our defence industry, and by further stating that, in the past two years, they cannot recount any actions of this government to grow Australia's sovereign industrial base, seemingly unaware of the handing down of the 2024 National Defence Strategy alongside the integrated investment program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is contrasted by those opposite's defence industry strategy, which was not just full of over-promising and under-delivering but promising and then nothing else after that. Their government liked to make announcements and issue press releases, but, when it came to funding defence projects, when it came to monitoring their progress to ensure what came off the line was not just battle-ready but fit for purpose, these announcements—and they can only be called that because they were not allocated a single dollar afterwards by the coalition government—totalled $42 billion. Perhaps the strategy of denial is a bit older than what we first thought, but that's what you get for having a government with 23 defence ministers and assistant defence ministers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;">
                  </span>As for denying growth in our defence industry, I would like to use my state of South Australia as a prime example of why the member for Herbert might want to rethink his narrative before putting up another motion like this in the future. From the latest figures available, 2022-23, South Australia experienced an eight per cent growth to our defence industry, contributing over $1.68 billion into the industry nationally. It is an industry that accounts for 9½ thousand jobs directly, and these numbers are only expected to rise in the coming years. I can look to many companies in my electorate, like Aimpoint RPL, delivering on labour shortages for the defence industry, veterans being able to get into a job; AML 3D; Levett Engineering; Basetech; Century Engineering—fantastic SMEs. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="260805" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HASTIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:48</span>):  It was all the way back in April 1951 with their backs against the wall that fewer than 1,200 Australian, Canadian, New Zealand and American troops held firm against overwhelming odds, against a 6,000-strong communist Chinese force. Spread thinly across some seven kilometres of mountainous terrain and under constant assault for three days, our soldiers prevailed against a numerically superior enemy. This was our victory at the Battle of Kapyong. It was a decisive turning point of the war.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an understatement to say they faced a complex set of tactical challenges against wave after wave of the enemy. Here we are today, nearly 75 years later, facing the most complex set of strategic challenges since Kapyong, the Korean War and the Second World War before it. We are living in a dangerous world, and Australia is at the forefront of great power competition and the threats posed by authoritarian powers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kapyong proved then what we know is still true today—that Australians always punch above our weight, and we can prevail. There are no limits to what we are capable of if we are given a fighting chance. It is true of our soldiers and it is true for Australia's defence industry. A strong and capable sovereign defence industrial base is indispensable in our mission to keep Australia safe and secure. A strong and capable defence industry means a strong and capable Defence Force, which in turn means a strong and capable Australia. Australian defence entrepreneurs and innovators punch above their weight. Several have been growing their businesses and equipping our allies and friends. We have world-leading capacity to deliver state-of-the-art platforms and state-of-the-future capabilities. We offer many things wanted by the advanced militaries of the world, including by our friends fighting for survival in Ukraine. We have leaders in defence industry who are showing the way. We have tasted what's possible. But it's not the full story.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the Albanese government, Australia's sovereign defence industry isn't being given a fighting chance. Instead of supporting the industry, Labor is starving it. Under the Albanese government, there have been two years without moving the dial—two years of endless reviews and inconsequential aspirations. Programs have paused, spending has stalled and uncertainty abounds. Everyone in defence industry fears for their future, with economic pressures, crippling inflation and an absence of investment and imagination making conditions tougher than ever. Numerous firms are, at best, pivoting away from defence to survive, and, at worst, shutting down and going under.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian defence industry can punch above its weight; we just need to give it a fighting chance. A Peter-Dutton-led coalition government will invest more in defence and defence industry, sooner. If elected, we will give sovereign defence industry a chance to get moving again, and we will give our patriotic entrepreneurs and innovators a fighting chance. When they win, we all win.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have AUKUS pillars I and II, the race to restore our surface fleet and to keep our submarines on station, and the need to reinvigorate our Defence Force. We cannot be left behind. And we should not leave it to others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition will restore faith in our own industrial heft. We'll grow our sovereign industrial base and provide support and certainty to small, medium and growing enterprises, to urgently deliver the future capabilities we need today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are running out of time. The most sober assessments warn that there is no longer a decade of strategic warning time. Meanwhile, the Albanese defence establishment seems intent on operating with a decade of self-imposed waiting time. We can't afford to wait any longer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My message to Australia's defence industry is this: we know you're hurting; we hear the disappointment; and we see what you see—that the Albanese government continues to let you down and turn its back on you. Well, the coalition has your back and we'll do whatever we can to get you back in business. We know you punch above your weight. We know that there are no limits to what you can achieve if you have a fighting chance, and that a strong and capable sovereign defence industry means a stronger and more capable Defence Force, and, therefore, a stronger and more capable Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the member for Herbert for moving this motion. We support it. The time to act is now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those members on the other side have committed $50 billion over the next 10 years, and most of it will be spent in the next decade. They assume, absolutely, that we still have 10 years to wait, and, if you look at the forward estimates, you see $5.7 billion, which perhaps accounts for inflation—perhaps; it's unlikely. But most of that money, $3.8 billion of it, will be spent in the fourth year of the forwards, and that just shows that this government, the Albanese government, is not serious at all about defence. They are playing politics. They are dressing up—they're wearing the uniform—but they're not actually serious about building defence industry and a strong Defence Force. And we are weaker for it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="86256" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:52</span>):  Securing our defence industrial base is a topic worthy of serious debate, and I thank the member for bringing the topic. It is important—and I say that as someone who has taken a great interest in defence strategic issues here as Chair of the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, but also, in a former life, oversighting the Victorian government's defence industry unit, some years ago—many years ago, now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It should be serious. I do say—and I say this with respect: it is a pity that this motion that you've chosen to bring is framed in such terms. It's full of inaccuracies, it's frankly ridiculous and it's immature. The interjections—and I'll say: those from both sides—have demeaned the topic. There was the interjection that you made to the previous speaker as he left: 'Make sure you tag me on Facebook.' I mean, this is a serious topic, and I do appreciate the former minister's contribution both in the portfolio and to the debate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our nation's defence industrial base is a critical strategic capability. As has been said, it has a deterrent value in its own right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are the lessons from Ukraine. If you had to pick a couple, they'd be that our resilience and our ability to manufacture the consumables of violent conflict and to repair the platforms are critical. It's not to make everything here; that will never happen. We should make more here, but we'll never make everything here. But you've got to be able to manufacture the consumables and repair your platforms, and that also contributes jobs and economic activity. So it is a pity that we're debating such a motion in the terms in which it has been put forward, over real debate. There is one thing that's right, as every speaker has observed. These are the most challenging strategic circumstances in decades. That comfortable assumption, which our country's enjoyed for 70 years—of 10 years of warning of a violent conflict that may come at us—is gone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Defence policy, including defence industry policy, should be contestable. It absolutely should be contestable. Serious people and serious parties of government should strive for bipartisanship wherever possible and avoid inflaming conflict for conflict's sake in the domestic political debate. Anyone with half a brain, anyone with a quarter of a brain and certainly the shadow assistant minister should know that defence industry grew by 4.1 per cent in the first year of the government, with over $10.6 billion of economic activity. The number of people employed grew by six per cent. Over 100,000 Australian jobs are supported by defence industry. We secured the largest single export contract in Australian defence industry history: more than 100 Boxer vehicles worth $3.1 billion, with more than 600 jobs in Queensland alone. We brought forward the delivery of numerous capabilities, including army landing craft. We've invested in Australian industry to further develop Ghost Bat, the first military combat aircraft designed in Australia for 50 years. We're investing in Australian air and missile defence in partnership with Australian industry. I'll put in a note of bipartisanship; that is a bipartisan issue. It continues an initiative of the former government and brings it forward with $14 billion to $18 billion of investment through the Integrated Investment Program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the kind of discourse we should be having. It is peak irony for speakers on this motion to be talking about certainty. They had a revolving door of defence ministers, with 23 ministers through the portfolio in nine years. It was patently ridiculous. As has been said, it was all announcement and no delivery: 'Yes, we've got the means.' They make the point about running onto the battlefield waving a press release, but it's a fact: $42 billion of announcements without any spending commitments in the budget. That's not adult government; it's not how you should treat the defence portfolio.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You absolutely can critique, and we can have a contested debate on whether the government should do more. Should we do more on this? Should we do less on that? Let's have that debate—absolutely—but please acknowledge that restructuring the investment program and the defence industry strategy is a serious effort to respond to the circumstances we face, and every announcement is actually funded in the budget. That is something that didn't happen. If you were being sensible about it, you'd actually acknowledge that and commit not to have that kind of nonsense happen again if you ever form government. Twenty-eight projects running 97 years late—yes, some major projects will run late.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what are we doing about it? We're overhauling the Defence Industry Development Strategy. It's a clear focused plan to support Australia's defence industry and workers. There are grants. There's clarity on priorities. There were too many defence industry sovereign priorities; it wasn't a label to be thrown around. If everything's a priority, then nothing's a priority. We're putting in place easier-to-do business reforms on procurement and on flexible contracting. Let's have a debate about the substance instead of throwing silly words around.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:58</span>):  I'm conscious of the time, so I'm going to focus on the importance of defence industry—not just now, but historically. I want to take you back to June 1942. Everyone remembers that. What happened in June 1942? It was the Battle of Midway. You've seen the movie; there are two versions of it. You've seen young men flying into literal hell. That was a key part of the battle. Of course, that bravery and sacrifice turned the tide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is less known and less reported is the role of defence industry in turning the tide. We know that the key ship, the USS <span style="font-style:italic;">Yorktown</span>, had been severely damaged in a battle earlier. The initial assessment for that aircraft carrier was that it would take months—six weeks at best—to repair it and have it back ready for use. But they gambled on defence industry back in the United States, through ingenuity and hard work, turning it around in a matter of days. They worked 24 hours, multiple shifts, never slept and put themselves in the headspace of those young men who were going to get in the planes and fly into hell. They got the USS <span style="font-style:italic;">Yorktown</span> battle ready and back out to support the Battle of Midway. That only happened because there was a defence industry that was supported. It was backed up, and it was ready and able to be used when it was needed most.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what this motion from the member for Herbert is about. It's about having a solid defence industry that is ready and capable for when we need it, because if we take them for granted and we don't support them when they need it—and we've seen the reported statistics on the lack of confidence in sovereign capability being called upon now—then when we really need them they won't be there to support us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is a lesson from history that we should heed. All of us in this place, when we're looking to keeping our nation safe and doing the hard work that is required, should never forget the role of the defence industry. It matters just as much as the bravery of the people who are now commemorated in our War Memorial.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Western Sydney is the third-largest economy behind Sydney CBD and Melbourne in Australia, but for far too long the residents of our suburbs have paid the price, living with congestion and traffic jams and no sewerage or parks. Our communities have been left behind. We've been subjected to underinvestment by successive state and federal coalition governments, with nothing more than press releases and photo-ops for announcements that never materialised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This has changed dramatically since 2022. Western Sydney finally has a government that will deliver for our region. Most recently, the Albanese government announced a substantial infrastructure package for Western Sydney, with funding allocated in the most recent budget. The announcement committed $1.9 billion towards 14 new projects and additional funding for two existing projects. The new projects invest all over Western Sydney, including Mamre Road, Mulgoa Road, Elizabeth Drive, Garfield Road, Memorial Avenue and Appin Road. These projects will deliver much-needed upgrades to these congested roads.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, the announcement on 6 May also committed $20 million to partner with the New South Wales government to expand the scope of the south-west rail planning business case to include consideration of expanding the line to the Macarthur region, something that I and the member for Macarthur have been calling for for eight years. The Albanese government has also committed an additional $147.5 million to new planning projects and $70 million in additional Australian government funding for existing projects. Overall, it's a very impressive package that delivers for our community at a time when it most needs it. Our region has suffered from underinvestment for a decade, and this package, which is in addition to other investments, will go a long way to addressing our region's needs. It will keep our region moving during the current economic boom.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The most recent announcement builds on other investments in other projects, specifically in the electorate of Werriwa. That includes the Western Sydney airport, which is on track to open in 2026 and has already created 4,300 direct jobs during its construction. Half of those jobs are going to residents who live in Western Sydney. By having their work closer to where they live, it means they can get home to be with their families more quickly. The airport has also met its targets for employing a percentage of First Nations and CALD Australians, encouraging and creating greater on-the-job training and skills. Thousands more jobs will be created as the airport begins operating, creating more jobs for locals close to home—jobs that will be accessed by the new toll-free M12 motorway, another piece of infrastructure being delivered by the Albanese Labor government. The new motorway is currently 50 per cent complete and on track to open with the new airport, creating billions in economic activity and ensuring residents spend less time on the road and more with their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also think of the recent opening of the additional commuter car park at Edmondson Park station and the commitment by the New South Wales Labor government to build a lift at Macquarie Fields railway station. The former not only meets today's commuter needs but adds 2,000 carparks to Edmondson Park, a growing suburb in my electorate. And the latter, the final upgrade of Macquarie Fields railway station, is about righting injustices. The previous Liberal state government refused to address, over its decade in office, the fact that nobody could use that railway station if they had a pram or if they were elderly, because the 75 stairs up and down made catching a train just impossible for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On both of these matters, I'd like to give a particular shout-out my state colleague, the Hon. Anoulack Chanthivong, the member for Macquarie Fields. He has worked alongside us with petitions and speaking to residents to make sure that both of these infrastructure projects became a reality. Community needs change, and so do governments. The government was elected to deliver, and after years of media releases and years of inertia and years of empty promises, the people of Werriwa in south-western Sydney will get the infrastructure they deserve.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="281513" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs McINTOSH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:06</span>):  I would like to acknowledge the passion for Western Sydney held by both the member for Werriwa and the member for Macarthur. I do see that in this place, but I think the member for Werriwa was a little bit off when she talked about media releases. Quite recently, the only communications we've received from the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government has been via media releases at midnight informing our community in Western Sydney (1) that we would be the most impacted community under flight paths, and (2) about the infrastructure that was ripped away and then restored.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's actually disappointing, the outcome, for people in Western Sydney under this Labor government. Infrastructure projects had begun, and the minister has now taken away funds for projects like the M7-M12 interchange. This left the New South Wales government gobsmacked. Projects have had funding more than halved, like Mulgoa Road stage 2, which is in my electorate of Lindsay. I'd like to ask the minister where the $117.5 million is that's missing for this particular upgrade for the community of Lindsay. And we had to wait more than 90 days for the review which saw the minister take funding off the table for Western Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Greater Western Sydney is home to around one in 10 Australians and deserves a government that will listen to our community and meet the region's continuously growing infrastructure demands. The government's immigration numbers keep climbing, yet housing construction rates are not keeping pace at all. Across every part of Western Sydney, whether you're in Camden, Fairfield or Parramatta, you are experiencing a diminishing of your local services and infrastructure. Hospitals and schools are bursting at the seams. We know this; we hear this every single day. Local roads are clogged and trains are hard to get on in peak hour. We need a government that recognises that, if the Western Sydney population continues to rise, then we need a lot more money invested in infrastructure rather than being taken away. We have an airport that will face access issues, as the minister refuses to invest in local roads. And there is an aerotropolis that desperately needs investment to get it going to meet its full potential.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take us back to 2022 and some of the actions of this Labor government. The infrastructure minister committed to the previous coalition government's infrastructure agenda. Then, she backflipped and did a 90-day review. The problem is that the review was not 90 days and it caused unease in so many communities in Western Sydney that had been hopeful of the infrastructure commitments they were relying on. The minister, on 6 May, finally did come to Western Sydney, so she did do something other than write a press release and release it at midnight, to make her announcement about new infrastructure funding. But it wasn't new funding at all. Our shadow infrastructure minister, Senator Bridget McKenzie, has noted the 90-day review took away around $2.5 billion from our communities, yet the Labor government has only reallocated $1.9 billion. There's meant to be a north-west Sydney corridor package, but we're yet to see the full details of this. South-west Sydney, as we know, is growing at such a rapid pace. It is ridiculous that the government has made these communities wait to sign back on to critical funding to ensure families can get to work and home again sooner and safer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen money ripped away from the Blue Mountains with the axing of the Great Western Highway upgrade, which would have transformed how the Central West meets Western Sydney. That was $2 billion of funding ripped away. There's funding for a Western Sydney rapid bus infrastructure upgrade, but local mayors are already frustrated at how this will work. It was a hot topic during last week's New South Wales parliamentary hearing for the inquiry into public transport for the airport and the aerotropolis. We also know many local governments want a metro from the airport to the south-west as quickly as possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 90-day infrastructure review is one failure from the minister, but let's not forget the Western Sydney Transport Infrastructure Panel she set up to review funding across the region. She received the report, but she chose to release it too late and she didn't listen to all of the recommendations—she didn't listen to the experts that were appointed to discuss multiple projects. One of the big ones was the local rural roads around Western Sydney International Airport that will soon be major freight roads. I've stood on those roads. They're in the member for Werriwa's electorate. They've got potholes on them. We have a major international airport on our doorstep. Our community deserves much better.</span>

For too long, during terms of the previous coalition governments, the member for Werriwa and I would advocate in this House and to ministers regarding the urgent need for transport, health and education infrastructure for our electorates, which are the fastest growing regions of the nation. Our calls went largely ignored, and, when plans for infrastructure in Western Sydney were announced, it was always a day late and a dollar short.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the many examples of this is the lack of rail connectivity from Western Sydney airport to south-western Sydney—an absolute joke. The airport rail link, which goes from Western Sydney airport to the north, to St Marys, will be unused, underutilised and of very little use. It was done as part of the Stuart Ayres re-election campaign. It was clearly the wrong thing to do, with the massive growth there around Macarthur, Leppington and Glenfield all to the south of the airport. It's an absolute joke. Why the previous federal and New South Wales coalition governments chose not to allocate support and provide any of these areas with a rail link to Western Sydney airport and the new city of Bradfield is beyond me. It's a real blight on the previous coalition government. It leaves our recently elected federal and New South Wales Labor governments with the very difficult task of now having to retrofit, in finding the funding and available land to build a rail line to Western Sydney airport from south-western Sydney. I'm very pleased that the minister has allocated funding for a scoping study for this, because, whatever happens, it should be evidence based, unlike previous policies of the coalition government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very concerned that, unless this rail link is built and built quickly, the new airport will become a white elephant as businesses, travellers, workers and freight won't have the transport infrastructure in place to access Western Sydney airport, which, by the way, is a magnificent piece of infrastructure. I've been out there many times. The airport terminal is just about built, as are the runways. It will be a great piece of infrastructure not just for Western Sydney and south-western Sydney but for Sydney and the country in general. But it needs connectivity to Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. The only way that is going to happen is a rail link from Western Sydney airport through the new city of Bradfield and on to the south-west through Leppington. This should have been done as heavy rail to allow freight to use that line. It probably won't be now because of the costs involved. But a rail link is certainly vital. Our government recognises this and is getting on with the job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The M7 and the Northern Road are already saturated with traffic, and adding more trucks, buses and cars onto them will be a disaster, both in terms of the environment and in terms of travel times. The previous government wanted a bus link to Western Sydney airport from the south-west. This would take hours and hours. A rail link is clearly what is needed and what is required. At least with Sydney airport, residents from Macarthur could commute via train into the airport for travel or work and could avoid the M5 if a major accident occurred, which often happens. The rail link would also extend the zone of economic opportunity much further, by offering transport links to thousands of residents, who could work at and around the aerotropolis. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm grateful that our government understands this and is taking steps needed to get a rail link underway. However, we really do not have the luxury of time on our side. Together with the New South Wales government, we need pragmatic action on this rail link as soon as possible. We've seen how poor planning under the previous government and lack of infrastructure investment can halt the economic and social aspirations of our communities, with suburbs in my electorate like Oran Park, Gregory Hills, and Macarthur Heights all being rapidly built by eager developers but with little oversight by New South Wales planning to ensure that transport, education and healthcare infrastructure is in place. For example, Oran Park experienced a 16 per cent increase in the one year between 2021 and 2022, with over 20,000 people living in this one suburb alone. Only 4,700 people resided in Oran Park in 2016. There's been a massive increase in population—which is good; we need people, particularly young people, to work in our industries. We knew it was happening, but planning authorities under the previous coalition state and federal governments did nothing and sat on their hands.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should be prepared for population growth, but proper planning is needed. This has left a long game of catch-up for both the Albanese and the Minns government, who are working very hard to deliver crucial infrastructure to these rapidly growing suburbs. The member for Lindsay understands that very well, as does the member for Werriwa, and as do I. Work is finally getting started on upgrading Appin Road, and that's a great thing as well.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300123" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WARE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:16</span>):  I rise to speak on this motion regarding Western Sydney, and I'll particularly be turning my attention to south-western Sydney. I acknowledge the member for Werriwa, who has brought this motion. The member and I have adjoining seats and regularly see each other at events in south-western Sydney. I was very pleased to be in the Chamber to hear the passion from my good friend the member for Lindsay and the shadow minister from Western Sydney, who has similarly been a very strong advocate for her area and for Western Sydney in general.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Greater Western Sydney is home to around one in 10 Australians. It's one of the fastest-growing areas in Australia and has been for many years. And it has not had the adequate planning. Every part of Western Sydney, from the Hawkesbury in the north to Wollondilly in the south to the Blue Mountains in the west to Parramatta and Liverpool in the east, needs additional infrastructure to support a rapidly growing population. My electorate of Hughes includes significant parts of south-western Sydney and parts of the Liverpool local government area. These areas are the gateway from the south of Sydney, from the Sutherland shire and from the Illawarra into Western Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Western Sydney is a major location for new immigrants, thanks to our vibrant and flourishing multicultural communities that live out there. I regularly attend citizenship ceremonies at Liverpool City Council, and it's always a privilege and a pleasure to meet and congratulate these newest Australians who are making the Liverpool local government area and the electorate of Hughes their permanent home. But our communities and our newest Australians should not have to move to an area that is facing immense pressure on our local schools, hospitals, public transport and roads.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This brings me to Heathcote Road. Heathcote Road is a 24-kilometre road, largely single-lane each way, that links southern Sydney, the Illawarra, to Western Sydney. It stretches right across my electorate, from the eastern end in Heathcote through to the western end in Moorebank. It was built in 1941 to support Holsworthy Barracks, and quite a bit has changed in southern Sydney and south-western Sydney since 1941. As I said, the road is still largely single-lane each way. It supports 36,000 car trips each and every day. There have been numerous deaths of people on this road and also significant koala kill over the past few years. This road needs to be duplicated. It needs to be duplicated for safety, congestion and productivity. This process was started under the previous federal and state coalition governments. At the western end, duplication has occurred, and it's currently occurring from Voyager Point right through to Moorebank.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of the 2022 election campaign, I pledged $17 million for a business case study for the duplication for the remainder of this road. I note that this motion concerns infrastructure, particularly road infrastructure, and the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government's role in that. The infrastructure minister has cancelled this project. Therefore, when I hear about the minister's dedication to infrastructure in Western Sydney and south-western Sydney, I say that her actions do not back up her words.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That brings me to another project that has been mentioned as part of this motion and that is in my electorate, which is the Moorebank Intermodal. It opened recently. I was present at the opening with the member for Werriwa and the Prime Minister. This was a project that began construction under the federal Liberal-National government. It is an amazing project. It is a very important, if not the most important, inland port in Australia. It offers unparalleled supply chain benefits and warehousing opportunities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I now turn to the Western Sydney airport. This has been under planning for many, many years. It is due to open next year, but it will open without an aerotropolis to support it. I wrote an op ed back in January about the federal government's need to invest in this project. It hasn't invested in this project. It is still not significantly investing in south-western Sydney.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Supporting elderly Australians through aged-care supports is one of the key roles of a federal government in Australia. It acknowledges the invaluable contributions that Australians have made in their working lives, as carers, in their personal lives and in building communities. Our safety net in Australia ensures that after years of hard work seniors and older Australians can receive the necessary supports and assistance that they require as they age.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has a proud history of supporting elderly Australians to live fulfilled lives through providing these programs and supports. The former Liberal government made record investments in the sector which saw more than 227,000 people access home-care packages. Our last two budgets released an additional 80,000 home-care packages to support older Australians to remain independent where possible and stay home as long as they wish with appropriate supports in place. This is in stark contrast to the current Labor government, which talks a big game on aged-care supports but has released just 9,500 additional packages since coming to government before this latest budget. As of December 2023, we had 51,044 people on the home-care package waitlist. This new budget provides for an extra 24,100 packages. It's clearly an improvement on the 9½ thousand but not even half of those on the waitlist.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These aren't 'nice to have' packages; these are necessities for older Australians. For many, they are the key to a quality life. Under the current government, this sadly hasn't been the case for many seniors and elderly Australians in my community. Participants in my community who have the Commonwealth home services program packages have not had a smooth transition from the previous council run service to the new Commonwealth provider. This year alone, my office has been contacted by many constituents who have been told by service providers that their waitlist had closed, with too many people already on them. Those service providers that do have waitlists do not have enough workforce to provide for those on their list. The only way that people can get onto the waitlist is when someone else no longer needs their package, whether that's through moving away, going into aged care or, sadly, passing away. It should never be the case that elderly Australians must wait for fellow Australians to pass away before they can access the care they need and deserve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to share some examples from across my community in the Yarra Ranges to paint a picture of the circumstances my constituents are facing. I'll begin with John, who is 92, from Lilydale and needs garden maintenance and mowing. John is unable to even get on the waitlist, with all providers saying their waitlists are full. Majorie, who is 99 and from Chirnside Park, needs additional respite hours for her family, who are her full-time carers, as well as a wheelchair, a walker and podiatry services. She recently had her two hours per week cut back to 1½ hours. There's John, who is 80 and from Montrose, who has muscular dystrophy and is no longer able to do his garden maintenance. John requires new assessments but had to wait five weeks for that assessment to happen, wait for the package to be provided and then wait again for services to become available for him. There's Lorraine, who is 89 and from Chirnside Park. She needs assistance with shopping and home and garden maintenance but has been told that 'no-one is available to help at the moment' and to keep checking in with the service provider. This is an elderly woman who needs help to get the basic necessities at the supermarket, and no-one is available.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This doesn't just impact the lives of the clients; it impacts their families and carers, who have no choice but to follow up with these providers and departments. It's simply not good enough. These situations aren't just happening in the Yarra Ranges and Casey; they are happening across the country. The Albanese Labor government is failing to address this shortfall in aged-care packages, and elderly Australians are paying the price every day.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300126" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr REID</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:27</span>):  I have to agree with some of the opening remarks that the member for Casey just made. I agree that we should absolutely support our older Australians both at home and in residential aged care. People in Australia deserve to age with dignity and deserve to age with respect. But what I would say to the member for Casey is: in the 10 years that the coalition government were in power, why was that not the case? You talk about these record investments in residential aged care and these record investments in home-care packages, but I've got tell you: when I was working in the hospital and saw these people coming in both from home and from the aged-care sector, we were still seeing staff shortages and we were seeing residents not get the care that they needed or that they deserved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What does that look like in real terms? I'm talking about large pressure areas, large wounds, on the back of the head and on the back of the hips that went down to bone and were covered in maggots. That's what I'm talking about when I see no investment in aged care. I'm talking about people sitting in their own excrement in their home and in aged-care facilities because there's no staff and no funding in that sector. I'm talking about real people in these real conditions who end up grossly unwell and then require tertiary critical level support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I agree that we need to support our elderly Australians, but that was not the case, and I'm not going to be lectured by the opposition on home-care wait times. When they were last in government, they allowed these home-care package waitlists to increase to almost three years for some package levels. They saw 129,000 elderly Australians on that waitlist—double what it is now—and they only acted and started to do something about it when they realised it was a problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-GeneralInterjecting">A government member:</span>  Right before the election.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Dr REID:</span>
                  </a>  Right before the election—absolutely right. That is the definition of a coalition government: reactive. They're never proactive. They don't see the benefit in making sure that our society remains healthy and our people can age with dignity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we can stop it with the lecturing and focus on what the Albanese Labor government is doing in this space to make it better for older Australians. We know that older Australians want to stay at home for longer. The Albanese Labor government is ensuring that older Australians can access a home-care package more quickly, and from next year we will deliver the game changing Support at Home program, because we believe that older Australians should have the opportunity to age where they want to, and for many Australians that's in their own home. In the 2024-25 federal budget handed down by Jim Chalmers, the Treasurer, the government is investing $531.4 million to fund an extra 24,100 home-care packages by 30 June 2025. This investment is expected to bring wait times down to an average of six months from assessment. It's going to support older Australians to stay in their homes for longer and bring the number of people supported by home-care packages to a record 300,000. People assessed as having urgent care needs—urgent care needs, Member for Casey—approved as a high priority are typically being assigned their home-care packages within one month. These are some of the reforms that we are making in the aged-care space. We are making sure that we are putting the money where it needs to go to make sure that elderly Australians can age at home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say the Albanese Labor government listen to older Australians—and the aged-care sector too, because people do work in it—and we are committed to delivering ambitious reforms to in-home aged care that will serve the needs of all older people in Australia now and into the future. The new Support at Home program is on track to start on 1 July 2025, and more details will be released in due course. This new program will give older Australians better access to care, better control and faster access when it is introduced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, looking at our aged-care reforms and the money that we're investing in aged care, and looking also at health care—affordable medicine, urgent care and general practice—we see that all of these things are helping our older Australians and making sure that we have a happy and healthy society.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:32</span>):  I am very happy to rise to support this motion brought by the member for Casey, and I thank him for bringing the importance of home-care packages and the current significant underfunding in home-care packages to this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend a lot of the words of the member for Robertson. He said that this government is committed to ambitious reforms. I am sure that this government is committed to ambitious reforms, but a commitment to ambitious reforms has to date not resulted in nearly enough home-care packages for Australians who desperately need them. The member also said that these reforms were intended to commence in July 2025. We're currently in June 2024, so I'm not sure if that was some sort of error or whether it does mean that these reforms will not commence for at least another 12 months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am sure that most members of this place go around and see aged-care facilities. One of the nicer parts of the job is going out and giving flowers to people who have turned 100, for example, and things of that nature. It is good that there is an aged-care sector that has changed significantly over the years and that now we are moving a lot more towards wanting to accommodate the many older Australians who want to stay in their own homes for as long as possible. This is particularly important as we age. Older Australians must have the right to age in place for as long as possible with as much dignity as possible, and any assistance that can be given should be given.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a package in place. We have home-care packages in place. But I must say that it is one of the most asked-about issues, if I can put it that way, that come into my office. Trying to navigate the My Aged Care system is extraordinarily clunky and very, very difficult at the moment. Frequently we find, whether it is the aged person themselves or their family members trying to navigate that system, they often require some additional assistance. What we have seen is waiting lists for home-care packages blow out. We know that this next generation of older Australians do want to stay in their own homes for longer but Labor's budget has only provided an additional 24,100 home-care packages. It also follows a revelation that there have so far only been 9½ thousand additional home-care packages released by this government. This compares to the 50,000 older Australians who we know are on the waitlist right now. A child in infants school can do that maths and know there is a considerable shortage in our current home-care packages. Over the last few years of the former coalition government, there were an additional 80,000 home-care packages provided, so this Labor government's budget has failed to even deal with the current demand for home care, let alone to prepare for the next generation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recent data has shown some of the most vulnerable older Australians are waiting as long as an entire year to get access to a home-care package. We heard specific examples from the member for Casey that he has heard about from people within his own electorate. What we have seen nationally is that wait times for level 3 packages have now blown out to between nine and 12 months. Wait times for level 4 packages have now risen to between six and nine months. This is clearly unacceptable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is really disappointing to see that the Albanese Labor government, which has spoken quite a lot about aged care, is still leaving some of the most vulnerable older Australians waiting for up to a year to get access to a home-care package. This is not good enough. The wait times need to come down. There needs to be action to help our most vulnerable older Australians to stay in place for as long as they can to give them the dignity they all deserve in their old age.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="298121" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SITOU</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:37</span>):  In April I was out doorknocking in Concord and knocked on the door of a woman in her 80s. She lives on her own and she described how her neighbours helped to create a sense of community and support around her. Her neighbour across the road comes over to mow her lawn, the neighbour to the side of her comes over regularly for a cup of tea, and the kids down the street stop by on their way to and from school. One night she was out at bingo. The neighbours dropped by but didn't see her. They tried calling her and couldn't get through so they started calling her family to alert them that she might be missing. When she finished at bingo and checked her phone, she found a bunch of missed calls and messages from concerned family and neighbours. She loves living on the street but now she makes it a point to let her neighbours know when she is popping out or going away on a trip so they don't get alarmed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I tell that story because it is an example of how neighbours can help build a sense of community around our older Australians. Not all of us get to live on that amazing street in Concord. Older Australians sometimes need extra help so they can stay living independently longer. Research shows the longer older people live in the community, the higher their quality of life and the lower the cost to government—win, win, win. It is also what older Australians want. They want to stay living at home longer independently. So it is pretty galling to see the member for Casey put forward this private member's motion, trying to spruik the Morrison government's achievements for older Australians. He, like me, was not here during the Morrison government years, so let me remind him of what those opposite actually did with home-care packages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here is what we learned from the royal commission into aged care. Under those opposite, older Australians needing high-level home care were left waiting almost three years for a package. In one 12-month period, 16,000 older Australians died waiting for a package to be delivered. In the same period, a further 13,000 older Australians who had been approved for a high-level home-care package were shifted into an aged-care facility against their wishes. And in 2021, there were almost 100,000 elderly people on the waiting list for a home-care package. Those things I just pointed to are not things that I would necessarily go around spruiking, but, okay, Member for Casey!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here is a snapshot of how representatives in the aged-care sector described the home-care system under the Morrison government. Council on the Ageing Chief Executive Ian Yates said that the system wasn't working. John McCallum, the CEO of consumer group National Seniors, said the home-care waiting list was a 'running sore' and a 'critical failure'. The aged-care royal commission's interim report was scathing, describing the lengthy queue as 'cruel and discriminatory'. These are still not things I'd necessarily be spruiking, Member for Casey. But you are right: the Morrison government did release 80,000 home-care packages over two budgets. It's just a shame they waited until the entire home-care-package system was on the brink of failure before trying to do anything to save it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We, on this side of the House, are trying to fix the system that we inherited from those opposite. We are introducing a new Support at Home program designed to consolidate and streamline the current home-care packages, short-term restorative care and respite care, so that older Australians are not left waiting and waiting to get their packages. We are providing 24,000 additional home-care packages, with the aim of supporting more people to get support at home. This investment is expected to bring wait times down to an average of six months from assessment. Just remember: their wait times ballooned out to three years. That was totally unacceptable. We are doing everything we can to support older Australians to be able to age in place.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SHARKIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:42</span>):  I rise to support the motion from the member for Casey. Week after week, I'm contacted by elderly residents or their family members, and those residents are struggling to get a home-care package. They've been assessed and they're just waiting. And those wait times have blown out. For the life of me, I can't work out why this is not front-page news.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we go back to February 2023, the wait time was between one month and three months, across all levels of home-care packages. This is what I think most Australians would think is a reasonable timeframe. Now, if you are assessed as needing a level 3 package, the waitlist—and the new data came out last week—is between 12 and 15 months for a level 3 and up to nine months for a level 4, the highest-level package.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To my thinking, if you are assessed as needing a level 3 or 4 package, you need it immediately. You don't need it in nine months or 15 months. This, I believe, is a national shame. I think it's a failure of the minister and it's a failure of the government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the question is: why is this happening? The answer, to me, is very clear, and it's in the motion. It's because last year, in the budget, there were only 9½ thousand new home-care packages, and in this year 's budget we've seen an allocation of 24½ thousand. This is why we've had this blowout.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me tell you some of the stories. I had two constituents, elderly women in their late 90s, who were assessed as having 'medium' priority, despite one suffering two falls and being confined to a chair during that time. Her family was told she would have to wait months for her priority to be reassessed. I fail to see how she was not given high priority from the get-go. How is that reasonable? I had another elderly constituent who was approved for a level 4 home-care package in 23 September. Despite being terminally ill, she was also given only 'medium' priority. After contacting my office and asking for assistance, she was advised that the timeline of one to three months was only a guideline. Sadly, we believe this person passed away without accessing any care. Another elderly constituent was approved for a level 3 package in August last year. Nine months later, that package has not come to fruition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister is very well aware of the long waiting list for aged care at home. The minister, out of every person in this place, should know the importance of a home-care package. I play it with a straight bat. I'm not part of the government, and I'm not part of the opposition. I look at the data, and I look at what my constituents are bringing to me. We were in a better place two years ago with respect to the waitlist for home care than we are today. We have, as of December last year, more than 51,000 elderly Australians waiting, and that figure is six months old. We don't have an updated figure. So the 24,000 packages allocated in this year's budget are not going to even halve the number of people on the waitlist.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is the government not addressing this? I think it's because we don't have the media pressure that forced the previous government to have a royal commission into aged care. We needed it, and the report was titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect</span>. But, three years on, people think that we had a royal commission and the problem is fixed. We don't have the media pushing this along, along with some of us members of parliament. We need every Australian who is in this scenario or whose family is in this scenario to contact their MP and to contact the media. We need to have an angry community about this, because it is not fair.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I desperately ask the media: if you're listening to this, if you flicked over to the Federation Chamber wondering what's happening in here, these are stories that you need to share with the Australian community. We should all be outraged. How can this be? A person in their 90s is waiting at home tonight, possibly chairbound or bedbound, and not getting care. We are a better nation than this. I would urge the government: you said you were going to put the care back in aged care, so, for goodness sake, start doing it.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BELYEA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dunkley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:47</span>):  Two weeks ago, the Treasurer announced a further investment of $531 million into home-care packages, providing an additional 24,000 home-care packages, bringing the number of people that will be supported by home care to a record 300,000. The member for Casey's assertion that the Albanese government has funded only 9½ thousand home-care packages is incorrect. The premise that we are not doing enough is misguided and couldn't be further from the truth. It is incorrect. When the Liberal government was in power, waitlists were double what they are now. The system was broken. However, the Albanese government has been working hard to fix the system that we inherited, because Labor cares about older Australians. We are continuing to consult with older people, their families, and aged-care providers and workers across the sector to ensure the system meets older people's needs and improves the standard of aged care. The new Aged Care Act will focus on providing dignity and respect to older Australians. It is based on meeting the rights of older people and putting older people at the centre of aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The new act responds to the findings of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety and the taskforce report. The investment will continue the work we have delivered to date to reduce home-care waiting times and support more Australians to access in-home aged care and live where they want to live. Older Australians will also benefit from a newly established support-at-home program. This program will be implemented thanks to the investment of $174 million for ICT infrastructure and includes a single assessment system. This system will make access to aged care simpler and more streamlined for older Australians. In addition to this, $111 million has been invested over four years into the new aged-care regulatory framework. A stronger regulatory framework will protect older people accessing aged-care services and ensure high-quality, timely and safe care. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To provide quality and timely services to the elderly, we are committed to growing the workforce to meet the demands of Australia's ageing population. The government has committed to investing $88 million over four years to continue to attract and retain the aged-care workforce. In addition to this, the provision of free-fee TAFE gives those that wish to work in the sector the opportunity to access qualifications and secure jobs for free. This is further supported by an increase in wages for aged-care workers. In 2022, the Labor government introduced a 15 per cent pay rise, and that has been implemented. Improving staffing solutions will create better conditions for the aged-care workforce and grow the home-care workforce in regional, rural and remote areas. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government cares about older Australians and the people that work in the sector. The comprehensive measures and funding announced by this government will ensure that those that need access to timely, quality services and care will receive them when they need them.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:51</span>):  I rise in support of the member for Casey's motion today. Australia's elderly population is growing, so we need solutions to care for our parents and our grandparents who have given so much to our country over their lifetimes. Home care is an important arm of our aged-care framework, yet this government does not seem to recognise the need and desire of many of our elderly to receive in-home care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the previous coalition government, we saw over 227,000 Australians access new home-care packages. In our final two budgets, 80,000 packages were released. This ate into the list, but of course more had to be done. In contrast, in Labor's first two budgets, we only saw 9,500 additional packages made available. Since this motion was lodged and we've had the budget delivered, we've seen a few more in the third budget but nowhere near enough to meet the need that is out there. It's left many waiting far too long on waiting lists to receive the care that they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've had many discussions with people from the Redlands who have been affected by this shortfall. They haven't received the support and help that they deserve because of Labor's inaction on this front. They've sat through shocking wait times, meaning for months or even years they've not received the care that they need. I want to share with the Chamber a few examples. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Peter, from Ormiston, is 81 years old and has vascular dementia. He was accepted for a level 3 home-care package in November and he was told that there would be a four- to six-month wait for services. This was then blown out to nine to 12 months. When my office contacted My Aged Care regarding this matter, it was informed that the wait time was now 12 to 15 months. It's unacceptable that Peter, at 81 years of age, must wait for up to 15 months. John from Russell Island has been waiting since November for help. He wrote to me:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">My Aged Care is a failure largely due to a lack of sufficiently trained staff and the lack of current information as to service providers who can help. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Practitioners advised us that they do not service the Bay Islands. My Aged Care staff have been reduced to a group of "box tickers" and users of standard letters. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, of course, those working in this space can only do what they can under the conditions that are provided to them by the government. John wrote:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there's Darlene from Coochiemudlo Island. Her husband has Alzheimer's disease. He is on a level 2 home-care package but needs more help. If he goes to a level 3 package, he'll be waiting 12 to 15 months to receive that help. Another constituent of mine from Ormiston was on the waiting list for an aged-care package at 97 years of age. He unfortunately did not receive any help before his passing.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">A nation can be judged by the way it treats its most vulnerable. Our senior Australians deserve support to live comfortably in their own home if possible. These Australians who've reached out to me are just a small percentage of Australians who are despairing at the state of our aged-care system. They are struggling to live the lives that they deserve because of unacceptable delays and inadequate care that prevent them from enjoying life within their own home. Labor must do better on this front. Aged-care providers do a wonderful job to help as many senior Australians as they can. I join the member for Casey in calling on the government to immediately address the evident shortfalls of aged-care packages.</span>

And yet here we are again, this time on aged care. So let's look at the record of those opposite on aged care. Having overseen aged care at a time when there was a scathing royal commission, such that even the interim report was called <span style="font-style:italic;">Neglect</span>, to now trump their performance is quite breathtaking hubris. So what did the royal commission say about the Home Care Package system under their watch?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is particularly challenging when an older person is deemed eligible for a Home Care Package, because they must first wait in the national prioritisation queue before a package of services is 'assigned', and then they must find a service provider to deliver their care. That can all take a very long time, especially for those who have higher care and support needs.  Once someone is assessed as needing the highest level of care, a Level 4 Home Care Package, they can wait for a year and often longer for the Package to become a reality. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was for a level 4 package. We now know that for some of the lower level packages under those opposite the waits could be up to three years. The waitlist under those opposite blew out to 129,000 people, double what it is now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, under this government, people assessed as high-priority are typically receiving their package within a month. That's three years under them compared to one month under us. Returning to the royal commission's report:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Such waiting times would be unacceptable in any other system, but are common in home care today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, by 'today' they're referring to the time of writing the interim report. There is:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… no mechanism to follow up with people who are on waiting lists to give them updates, including about whether they have progressed up the waiting list or how long it will be before a Package is available.  In the interim, there is a clear and present danger of declining function, inappropriate hospitalisation, carer burnout and premature institutionalisation because necessary services are not provided. We—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">being the royal commission—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">have been alarmed to find that many people die while waiting for a Home Care Package. Others prematurely move into residential care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">By any measure, this is a cruel and discriminatory system, which places great strain on older Australians and their relatives.  It is unfair.  Older people should receive the home care services they need to live safely at home … It is shocking that the express wishes of older people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible, with the supports they need, is downplayed with an expectation that they will manage. It is unsafe practice. It is neglect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was the verdict of the royal commission on aged care regarding aged-care services under their watch. At the time we were elected they had implemented very few of the recommendations from the royal commission. This government has been focused on implementing all the recommendations. And make no bones about it: it's difficult, it takes time and it takes money. The previous government acted on aged care and funded extra packages only after they had allowed the system and older Australians to get to breaking point.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, that was the situation of neglect that the Albanese Labor government inherited, and we've been working to implement all the recommendations. One important thing we've done is provide a wage rise for aged-care workers. We want people to think of aged care as the valuable, skilled, long-term, rewarding career option that it is. We want to attract and retain the best workers. The additional $200 a week that aged-care workers now earn is a significant step towards achieving this. This is a significant way to address the delays in being able to access services by having more workers in the sector, having workers who are higher skilled, and keeping them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the upcoming budget we're funding an additional 24,100 home-care packages, bringing the number of people being supported by aged-care packages to a record 300,000. This is expected to bring the wait times down to an average of six months. We're also reforming the assessment system with a single streamlined assessment and a new evidence based assessment tool backed up by ICT infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is getting on with the job of fixing the aged-care system that was left behind by those opposite—one characterised by the royal commission as 'neglect'. This private member's bill is an exercise in trying to rewrite history.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282335" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HAINES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:01</span>):  I thank the member for Casey for moving this important motion. Home-care packages are an essential feature of our aged-care system. They allow people to stay at home longer and to live independently by providing nursing support and assistance with household tasks like cooking, cleaning and gardening. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Wangaratta Chronicle</span> recently shared Betty Toppin's story. Betty is a 90-year-old woman who's received home-care support for more than five years, in addition to medical support for her diabetes. Betty told the local paper, 'The cleaner comes and cleans the unit, she vacuums—she does all that work—and she does a lovely job.' There are many stories like Betty's, and I know home-care packages make a life-changing difference for people across north-east Victoria. That's why I've stood in this place many times highlighting the need for substantial Commonwealth investment in home care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I very much welcome the government's announcement of $531.4 million for an extra 24,100 home-care packages in the recent budget. I'm concerned, however, that despite this significant investment there will be very little immediate effect in my electorate of Indi. While home-care packages can make a monumental difference for people like Betty as they age, more and more people in my electorate are struggling to access the home care they need. Firstly, the process of getting an assessment for a package can be subject to complications and delays. Once a person has been approved for a home-care package, they face being put on a waitlist to access these supports. Concerningly, many providers across my electorate have closed their waitlists because of existing backlogs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, a lack of regional providers means that nurses, cleaners or gardeners are often travelling long distances over many hours to visit clients, which chews up budgets or sees providers simply stopping offering services in some towns. In the Murrindindi shire, in the southern part of my electorate, delays have worsened in recent years. Despite the best efforts of home-care package providers, there are simply not enough trained and suitable workers to give residents the support at home that they deserve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that workforce shortages can't be fixed overnight, which is why this government needs to continue doing everything it can to get more workers into the regions. These shortages mean that people feel like they will never get the care they need and will be forced to move into residential aged care sooner than is necessary. That's why, as a regional Independent, I consistently advocate for policies that will encourage more nurses, more support workers and more allied health professionals to move to our regions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Put simply, we will not fix existing delays with funding alone. We need to address the underlying causes of shortages in regional areas. We need to consider place based solutions that recognise the unique circumstances of regional, rural and remote Australia. We need to invest more in our regional universities and TAFEs so we can train the nurses and personal-care workers of the future. This is why I welcomed the announcement of paid placements for students studying for nursing and social work degrees, and it's why I also support regional university study hubs for towns like Alexandra in the Murrindindi shire. A study hub would be a game changer for young Australians wanting to stay, study and work in the region in aged care. We also need to pay workers in this crucial sector a decent wage, which is why I've supported the government's $11 billion commitment to funding wage rises in aged care. Extending funding for initiatives like the Home Care Workforce Support Program will help get more workers into areas where they are needed, and I was glad to see this funding extended in the budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Home-care packages are so important for people in my electorate and right across Australia. They preserve people's ability and right to live at home independently, even as some day-to-day tasks get harder. But the system is struggling with workforce shortages and service gaps, particularly in regional areas. More funding alone won't fix that problem. It's an all-of-government approach on this one. The government needs to push forward with its plan to grow the aged-care workforce so that all Australians can age with dignity; it needs to address the fundamental issues that rural and regional Australia faces with housing for workers to live in to come and provide the services that we need in rural and regional Australia; and it needs to continue to address the flexibility that we require with any government program to make sure that it works in rural, regional and remote Australia. So—while, yes, I'm happy to see investment in this budget for home-care packages—I want to see a whole-of-system approach that will address the issues specifically in electorates such as mine.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise today to address this House on intimate partner violence. One in every four Australian women have experienced intimate partner violence, an alarming, unacceptable statistic. In 2023, 49 women were killed due to gender based violence, and in the first five months of this year 31 women have been killed. These are women with dreams, ambitions, families and, most importantly, the right to safety. As representatives in this House, we must amplify the voices of these women and loudly proclaim that the women of this country are not alone. I stand here to emphasise the urgency of this issue. I am proud of the Albanese Labor government's commitment to addressing this issue. Our government has taken vital steps in tackling gender based violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Financial control is often used as a method of abuse in relationships. I have had too many women come to my office door in desperation, as a place of last resort. They want to leave home but cannot afford to. Women are frequently locked out of their finances, which are deemed a man's business, leaving them without the resources to escape a violent situation. It can cost thousands to move home as an individual and even more if you have children. That is why we are investing $925.2 million over the next five years to establish the Leaving Violence Program, a program that offers safety, support and the chance for survivors to rebuild their lives and start anew. Those eligible will be able to access up to $5,000 in financial support along with referral services, risk assessment and safety planning. Another campaign we have consistently supported is Stop it at the Start, focusing on prevention, early education and challenging disrespectful attitudes and behaviours. Through this campaign, we aim to lay the foundation for a future where respect and equality are the norm, focusing on creating a cultural shift from a very young age.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will introduce legislation to ban the creation and non-consensual distribution of deepfake pornography, addressing a new form of digital abuse by targeting the use of artificial intelligence to produce and disseminate explicit material without consent. We aim to protect individuals, particularly women and girls, from the lasting harm inflicted by these actions. We will ensure perpetrators face strict penalties and reinforce our nation's dedication to upholding the dignity and safety of our community in the digital age.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms build on the government's previous work led by the Minister for Women, Katy Gallagher, and social services minister, Amanda Rishworth. Our National Plan to End Violence Against Women and Children is supported by $2.3 billion in funding commitments. We are reforming the family law systems to make them simpler and more accessible for families going through difficult times.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249308" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PRICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Durack</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:11</span>):  I rise today to address a matter of great concern that affects the very fabric of our society—that is, domestic and family violence. Tragically in Australia this year alone, we have lost 22 women to family violence incidents and an additional 14 women who have been murdered in violence perpetrated by men. There are at least 39 children left without a mother, their lives altered forever. These are not just numbers. They are somebody's mother, sister, daughter, auntie or friend—loved ones lost, families shattered and community in mourning. As I speak, the police in Perth are investigating the death of a woman in Byford last night, believed to be a result of family or domestic violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When in government I was proud that the coalition took robust action on the issue of women's safety. We delivered landmark funding of $5.5 billion through two women's budget statements, prioritising women's safety, economic security and health. Our initiatives including trialling the escaping violence payment initiative and providing support for those on temporary visas escaping violence. These measures were designed to offer immediate relief and long-term support for women in desperate need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, the current government's approach has fallen short of its promises. During the 2022 election, the Albanese Labor government pledged to introduce 500 new family and domestic violence sector workers. Shockingly, the latest figures reveal that there are only 44 new frontline workers out of the promised 500. This government has not taken the filling of these roles seriously and it has left the sector overwhelmed and struggling to meet increasing demand, particularly in regional, rural and remote areas like in my seat of Durack.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Kimberley region in the north of my electorate the alarming rise in family and domestic violent offences serves as a stark reminder of the urgency of this issue, with recent police statistics detailing a shocking 1,700 reported family and domestic violence offences between January and March this year alone. Rates are up almost 50 per cent in five years. The Kimberley has the highest rates of family and domestic violence in all of Western Australia. Disturbingly, this is the second consecutive time the region with a population of around 40,000 people—not a lot of people—is unfortunately at the top of the list in Western Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, domestic violence abuse extends beyond physical violence. It manifests in insidious forms such as coercive control, which is a complex and often unseen form of abuse that requires greater education and much greater understanding. Furthermore, the rise of sextortion—I know I've said that wrong!—a form of online blackmail particularly targeting our youth, has tripled in the past year, leaving young lives shattered and families devastated. The coalition strongly supports age verification for social media. We must protect our children from exposure to these changes and empower our parents to safeguard their wellbeing. And while society's main focus is on women's and children's safety, I just want to pause and make sure we acknowledge that men can also be victims of domestic and family violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The recent tragic murders of Perth mother and daughter Jennifer and Gretl Petelczyc have prompted the Western Australia government to further amend their gun laws. The proposed laws will mean that anyone who is accused of family and domestic violence will have their guns confiscated by police until the claims are investigated and resolved. Now, this is a tough measure, which is going to require the police to act swiftly when accusations are made to identify actual and/or vexatious claims.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This epidemic of domestic violence is unacceptable. It is a national crisis and a national shame, but I do believe everyone has a role to play. Australia does require a cultural change. Men need to start having those uncomfortable conversations with their mates and to call out bad behaviour of other males who are talking or acting in a demeaning way to women because that is where it starts. Men must be better role models in the home and show the next generation of men what a good man looks like. It is our collective responsibility to stand up, to speak out and to be the change that we wish to see. Government has a role to play, and I encourage the Albanese government to do more.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="132880" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr MULINO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:16</span>):  I'll begin by commending the member for Holt for moving this motion. It's a very important and timely motion to discuss in this place. I also acknowledge the work that the member for Newcastle has undertaken over a long period of time on this issue and many related issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At this, the beginning of my speech, I acknowledge points made by both of the previous speakers, the member for Holt and the member for Durack, that men have a pivotal role to play in moving this issue forward. As a man who has seen this debate played out in the main chamber and in this Chamber, on this motion and others, it has led to a degree of introspection and thought about attitudes in my life and amongst my friends and how they've evolved over the years, so I think that is a useful starting point.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other point I would make, which I think other speakers have made, is there are shocking numbers in this debate. People often talk about one in four women having experienced intimate violence since the age of 15, and then there's the increasing number of women who have been killed by their partners. But, of course, as the member for Holt pointed out, behind every one of those statistics is a woman, is a person with dreams and aspirations, is a family and is a tragedy that touches on so many lives and has ripples throughout society, so it's really critical to look beyond that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And, finally, I wanted to make the point that in many areas of social policy there are short-run and long-run considerations, but I think there are few, if any, where they are as stark as in this case. The short-run needs are so jarring and desperate, often, where somebody—a woman in almost all cases—is seeking to escape, has an urgent and desperate need for financial and other support. The long-run issues in relation to intimate partner violence, and family violence more generally, relate to some of the most entrenched attitudes and social norms in society, so they are incredibly difficult to budge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're talking, in a lot of ways, about a set of social policies that has to grapple with the urgent and the immediate and, at the same time, are measures put in place that are preventative, that change attitudes in a very complex and slow-moving way. I think that's reflected in the fact that this government is trying to undertake holistic reform. The government has invested in the National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children, which is a plan over a 10-year horizon involving $3.4 billion. Within that plan there are both short-run and long-run components. As the member for Holt pointed out, the short-run component includes a significant step up—almost a billion dollars in assistance—for women for a safety net for those fleeing intimate partner violence. Those payments can provide support in terms of safety planning, risk assessments and referrals to support pathways. Of course, there are other mechanisms the government is putting in place, such as critical housing supports in the HAFF, and there are mechanisms like the prohibition and strong penalties against deepfake pornography.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are really critical short-term measures in which this government has invested significantly, but I want to say it's also critical that, in parallel with that, we invest in programs that move attitudes. Stop it at the Start is a really important preventive program that moves to change the attitudes of younger men—teenagers, in particular. I can say that this dovetails with and supports a number of other important programs in Victoria. We have Respectful Relationships. We need to make sure that we are undertaking a range of approaches on this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I might just add, finally, this point: I'm very conscious, as a representative of a very multicultural electorate that that adds another layer of complexity and nuance to this issue. It adds challenges, frankly, that there is a wide-ranging set of ways in which different committees approach these issues. We need to make sure that we are putting sensible and sensitive material in front of teenage boys, but we need to make sure that it's complex enough and nuanced enough to deal with all of those kinds of differences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is trying to look at this issue from a short-run and a long-run perspective, and I commend again the member for Holt for raising this very important issue.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282335" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HAINES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:21</span>):  I thank the member for Holt for this very, very important motion. We must continue to talk in this place about practical solutions to end intimate partner violence. But, more than talk, we must act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like so many others, I'm continuously shocked at the unacceptable rates of domestic and family violence in Australia, and I want to highlight the situation in rural and regional Australia, where unfortunately the statistics are even worse than in our capital cities. In regional Victoria, women are being killed at triple the rate of women in Melbourne. Figures published in December last year show that the top 26 local government areas in Victoria that experienced the highest rate of family violence are all in regional Victoria. It deeply distresses me that this includes councils in my own electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently met with frontline support services in my electorate to hear what the people on the ground need government to do to improve these statistics, and I want to thank them for the vital work that they do in my community. Like me, service providers support the government's announcement to extend the Leaving Violence Program. I also support measures that address the disturbing role that pornography plays in this crisis. I support cultural change campaigns like Stop it at the Start. But, speaking about cultural change, it will take decades at best. Government must back solutions that will have an immediate impact. We need to act now. We need to act deliberately to stop women dying.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Government can and must do more beyond what's listed in this motion, and I want to highlight three immediate actions the government can take today that will make a tangible difference to women's safety in regional Australia. Firstly, this government must better regulate industries which, when abused, have serious damaging social consequences, especially the abuse of gambling and alcohol. To end gender based violence, we must get serious about the impacts that these industries have. Research over many years has found a strong and consistent relationship between alcohol abuse and violence against women. In relation to gambling, a study undertaken by Australia's National Research Organisation for Women's Safety found that almost all women interviewed whose partner had a gambling problem described being subjected to severe financial abuse. I urge government to address alcohol marketing and after-hours delivery and to implement the recommendations of the parliamentary inquiry into online gambling led by the former member for Dunkley, the late Peta Murphy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the government must increase funding for frontline legal services. This message was crystal clear to me after I recently met with the Hume Riverina Community Legal Service in Indi. When a woman leaves her violent partner, her legal problems multiply. Child protection, tenancy, employment, consumer and family law: lawyers can assist with all of this, but right now there are simply not enough of them. Community legal centres are currently experiencing an 89 per cent increase in demand and are turning away around 1,000 people a day. A recent independent review led by Dr Warren Mundy found that the levels of funding under the National Legal Assistance Partnership, which is how the Commonwealth funds the legal services I've just described, is insufficient to meet Australia's legal assistance needs. Dr Mundy observed that the consequences flowing from this impact acutely on regional and remote areas of Australia. So I urge the government to implement Dr Mundy's recommendations to substantially increase funding for the legal assistance sector particularly in regional areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to see dedicated housing funding for regional Australia. We are increasingly hearing of women unable to leave unsafe homes because there is simply nowhere to go. The government's announcement of billions of dollars to increase housing supply, including for women fleeing violence, doesn't guarantee any funding for the regions. We need to lock it in. It needs to be guaranteed. Thirty per cent of Australians live in regional Australia, so we need to see 30 per cent of housing funding go there. Until the government dedicates housing supply funding to the regions, a key solution to keeping women safe from violence in Australia is simply not being realised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know this government understands the gravity of the situation for women. The Prime Minister has called it a national crisis. It is a national crisis. Keeping the conversation going in this House is important and good, but acting immediately with the funding and resources that will save women's lives right now is critical. It's crucial, and we must not delay.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CLAYDON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:26</span>):  I too want to thank my friend the member for Holt for bringing this motion before the House this evening. I echo her serious concerns about the safety of women in Australia. It's been a tragic year, but let's not pretend that 2024 has been wildly different from previous decades. We've all seen on the news—and Counting Dead Women Australia have recorded—that 32 women have been killed by male acts of violence so far this year. Many of them have been intimate partners of their killers. They have been found dead in their own homes where they should have been safe. They have been found in a bin, killed in shopping centres or while out jogging or walking or, indeed, killed in their cars.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know violence can happen anywhere anytime. It doesn't respect demographic boundaries. It can be in public or it can be private. But what we should also know is that violence is not inevitable. We don't want a world where our girls are growing up in fear or our boys somehow think this is normal behaviour. One in four women have experienced violence from an intimate partner since the age of 15, and too many women and children feel scared and unsafe in their own homes. It is violence that we can and must stop. We need our culture, behaviour and attitudes towards women to change. Enough is enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why the Albanese Labor government has set a goal of ending violence against women and children within a generation through our National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children. It's a big ambition. There are some people saying we can't do it, but I say to those people that no government has set this ambition before. We know it is not going to be easy, but this is the first time Australia has ever had a female majority government in our nation's history, and we are extremely determined. It should not be beyond us as a parliament and as a nation to turn around this epidemic of male violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got a national plan to help guide those actions for the next 10 years and address some of what we know are key drivers of family, domestic and sexual violence. The Commonwealth's focus will be very much around the prevention and early intervention spaces. I'm not going to have time to go through those this evening, but there have been allocations in the budget to ensure that we look at both prevention and early intervention. We know that this is critical in order for change to take place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to assure the Australian people that this is a government that is deeply committed to that goal of ending violence against women and children, and we will work every day to ensure that it is a reality.</span>
