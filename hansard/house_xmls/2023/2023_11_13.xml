            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This petition is opposing the Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen's plans to approve wind turbines being built off the Illawarra coastline. This will allow 105+ offshore wind turbines, each 260m+ in height plus 3 off-shore substations to be located 10km off the Northern Illawarra coastline and 30km off the Kiama coastline. These will be visible during the day and at night their red flashing aviation lights and white marine navigation lights will destroy the visual amenity. Research shows that underwater noise from offshore developments reduces the survival rate of marine animals and birdlife due to their impact on navigation, mating, marine ecosystems and migration pathways. The proposed REZ at 10km offshore will intrude into the zone protected &lt;15km offshore for whale migration! The noise during construction will be detectable to residents 100km away. Research shows offshore turbines built within view of the coastline up to 42km offshore, negatively impacts property values and tourism. The Illawarra coast is a major tourism destination. Exclusion zones around the turbines will restrict recreational fishers and divers across an area which covers 1,461km² of pristine ocean! Finally, each of the 315 turbine blades are 170m long, or the length of soccer field, and are not recyclable. This means they will only add to landfill as they are doing now overseas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to stop wind turbine power plants being built off the Illawarra coastline. If the community does not want this project, we ask the House to stop it.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Changes to funding for opioid treatment in Australia, and a move to prioritise pharmacy-based treatment, are disastrous measures that will lead to the closure of all private opioid treatment services in NSW, resulting in the loss of thousands of crucial treatment places, increased waiting times for public services, and co-payments for GP consultations. Additionally, public Clinics, which previously provided free treatment, may require patients to pay co-pays for their medications. The existing system allows patients to choose a doctor, medication, and dosing point that suits their health needs—the loss of private treatment services due to lack of funding and support will have a significant, negative impact on patient choice, worsen patient access to treatment, and will lead to serious drug-related issues in our local communities as a result of increased criminality and illicit supply of dangerous, unregulated drugs. Similarly, increasing fees at public Clinics will significantly disadvantage some of our most vulnerable patients, and create further barriers to ongoing treatment for their issues. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to re-examine the changes to Opioid Dependence Treatment, to provide a funding stream for private Clinics and other private services that will allow them to stay open to provide care to their patients, and to provide funding to cover the costs of patient admission and treatment in the Commonwealth-subsidised public treatment services. This will allow private services providing Opiate Agonist Treatment to remain viable, and therefore allow for greater patient choice and freedom of treatment over the proposed pharmacy dispensing model.</span>

He has been financing the medical treatment and spending 60 hours a week assisting his son Danny with rehabilitation. We are asking the Minister to show compassion and grant Mr Peter Hodgson permanent residency or at least extending his temporary Visa due to expire October 19th. The stress this is causing to Danny and his father should be taken into consideration. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence regarding petition number EN4157 on the inclusion of forensic psychological interventions under Medicare.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is aware of the challenges people are experiencing in accessing affordable and high-quality mental health care. The Government also understands that people who have contact with the justice system can be disproportionately impacted by the social determinants of mental ill-health, such as homelessness and unemployment, and often have complex mental health needs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government funds a range of mental health services including Medicare-subsidised services and other free or low-cost services for people with or at risk of mental illness. These include regional services commissioned by Australia's 31 Primary Health Networks, a national network of Head to Health Adult Mental Health Centres, and headspace which provides support to young people aged 12-25 years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Better Access to Psychiatrists, Psychologists and General Practitioners through the Medicare Benefits Schedule initiative (Better Access). A recent evaluation of Better Access found that while people able to access treatment experienced positive outcomes, many people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, regional, rural and remote areas as well as aged care residents were missing out on treatment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To address this, the Government will consider solutions not only to improve access to Medicare subsidised services, but also to a range of services across the mental health system. The Government is committed to working with both health professionals and those seeking treatment to ensure people have access to mental health care when and where they need it.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Through the 2023-24 Budget, the Government is investing $586.9 million in the mental health and suicide prevention system. This investment will lay the groundwork to make real, structural changes in response to the Better Access evaluation. It includes $91.3 million to address critical shortages in the psychology workforce and $17.8 million to upskill the broader health workforce in mental health. Improving the availability of the workforce will help ensure there is equity in service delivery, enabling longer-term reform.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to expanding Medicare for other types of services, the Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) is an independent body established to provide advice to Government on whether a new service should be publicly funded through Medicare using the best available evidence. This process ensures that Australians have access to services that have been shown to be safe and clinically effective, as well as representing value-for-money.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 25 July 2023 about a petition presented in the House of Representatives on 7 November 2022, seeking Commonwealth financial support for students undertaking work placements as part of their courses.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Getting more Australians into work remains a key objective for the Australian Government. For those who are studying and need additional help, our income support system is designed to be a safety net. Students who undertake placements as part of their studies may be eligible for student payments such as Youth Allowance or Austudy. To be eligible as a full-time student, a student must be undertaking at least 75 per cent of the normal full-time study load for that course. Practical training or placements off campus can count towards study load if the educational institution gives this component of a course appropriate weighting or recognition as full time study.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises that living on income support payments can be challenging, especially with the increases to the cost of living.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

The Accord Panel is focussing on key priority areas including the affordability of, and contribution arrangements to, higher education.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Universities Accord Interim Report </span>was released on 19 July 2023. The interim report notes the review 'will explore the possibility of requiring some form of financial support for students undertaking mandatory placements'.

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Labor Party has led federal electoral reform to increase openness in Australia's democratic system. Significantly, the Hawke Government introduced framework for the disclosure of political donations and electoral expenditure. This significant reform laid the groundwork for increased transparency, and Labor continued to pursue more rigorous donation reforms from opposition in 2016.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Government remains committed to strengthening the transparency of our electoral system and maintaining voter confidence in elections and referendums. In this pursuit, I am also mindful electoral reform is complex and requires studious consultation across the Parliament. As such, the parliament's multi-partisan Joint Standing Committee of Electoral Reform (JSCEM) is the appropriate forum for proposed electoral changes to be investigated and considered.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Already this term, the Government has updated Australia's referendum legislation to ensure the voter experience at the upcoming referendum is aligned to voters' experience at the last federal election. You will be pleased to know that in keeping with our commitments, our amendments included establishing a financial disclosure regime for referenda, and aligning foreign donation restrictions and authorisation requirements with those of federal elections. This Bill and changes were considered by JSCEM as part of the parliamentary process.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Last year, after JSCEM was constituted for this parliament, I wrote to it requesting its consideration of matters relating to the 2022 federal election. One of the issues I specifically requested it inquire into is the potential for 'truth in political advertising' laws to enhance the integrity and transparency of the electoral system. In its interim report, JSCEM recommended the Federal Government legislate to govern truth in political advertising. JSCEM continues to deliberate in this inquiry with a final report expected later this year; after I have considered its final report and recommendations, I will develop legislation to deliver long overdue reforms to our electoral system.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to legal reforms, there are existing measures undertaken to address misinformation and disinformation in the electoral system. Here the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) takes a proactive role, leading public education and responding to misinformation, as evidenced by their work at the 2022 Federal Election. The AEC is an independent statutory body and is responsible for the conduct and delivery of federal electoral events.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">During the 2022 federal election, the AEC ran an expanded 'Stop and Consider' campaign, building on the success of a similar campaign for the 2019 Federal Election. The AEC launched and maintained an Electoral Disinformation Register, which listed prominent electoral mis and disinformation and acted as an informative source. The AEC's work plays a vital role in upholding Australia's electoral reputation despite an ever- more complex operational and communication environment.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am writing in response to a petition by the Lactation Consultants of Australia and New Zealand (LCANZ), presented to the Standing Committee on Petitions on 7 November 2022. I apologise for my late reply, this matter has only now been brought to my attention having unfortunately been sent to an incorrect address.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">LCANZ's petition requests that grant funding made to the Infant Nutrition Council under the Agricultural Trade and Market Access Cooperation (ATMAC) program be rescinded and used for the implementation of the Australian National Breastfeeding Strategy. LCANZ are represented on the Breastfeeding Export Reference Group who assisted the Department of Health and Aged Care to develop the strategy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The LCANZ's petition notes the "marketing of infant formula undermines breastfeeding rates, and ... does not require promotion". Please note ATMAC funded activities related to the diversification and expansion of international trade and did not involve the domestic promotion or marketing of infant formula. The ATMAC program played an important role in assisting the sector to respond to both the COVID-19 pandemic and other market disruptions that restricted access to key destination markets.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Applications to the ATMAC program were assessed through a robust process consistent with the Commonwealth Grant Rules and Guidelines. The application period is now closed, and all grant funding was exhausted by the conclusion of the 2022-23 financial year.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 7 November 2022 regarding petition number EN4198, which proposes amendments to the Fair Work Act 2009 to allow employees to access leave to care for or following the death of a pet. I note that due to a technical error, the email was received by my office on 25 July 2023.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Fair Work Act 2009 establishes a safety net of minimum entitlements for all national system employees, including the National Employment Standards (with leave entitlements to support employees when they become sick or need to take a break from work), the national minimum wage and modern awards. The Act encourages workers and businesses to bargain in good faith to make enterprise agreements that deliver improved terms and conditions for workers and productivity gains for business.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Enterprise agreements can include terms that supplement the minimum entitlements in the National Employment Standards, such as the proposed additional paid bereavement leave. Certain enterprise agreements also provide employees with paid miscellaneous leave for reasons agreed with their employer.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence regarding Ministerial Petitions EN4203, EN4255, EN4266, EN4236, EN5009, EN5028, EN5029, EN5048.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The World Health Organization (WHO) is, and remains, a Member State-led organisation. Let me assure you that under international law, Member States such as Australia retain sovereignty regarding their public health policies. The WHO has no legal authority to force countries to accept any of its recommendations and can only provide aid and assistance at Member States' request The intent of the new instrument is to strengthen the international community's efforts in s. Australian law can only be changed by an act of the Parliament, not by any international treaty or other legal instrument.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is dedicated to strengthening national and global pandemic prevention, preparedness and response, and is committed to working with the Australian public and the international community to be better prepared for the next pandemic. As referred to in the Ministerial Petitions referenced above, two major reforms through the WHO are being considered: the development of a new international instrument on pandemic preparedness, prevention and response, such as a treaty; and targeted amendments to strengthen the implementation of the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR). These processes will work to close gaps identified through independent reviews of the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The intent of the new instrument is to strengthen the international community's efforts in preventing, preparing for and responding to future pandemics. The new instrument provides an opportunity to reduce the risk and impact of health threats, such as that posed by COVID-19 by strengthening global health systems and disease surveillance, while enhancing equity and future pandemic response. Australia is actively engaged in the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (INB), which is drafting and negotiating the new instrument. For further information about the work of the INB please visit https://apps.who.int/gb/inb.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This new instrument is distinct from the IHR. The IHR is an existing legal framework that defines countries rights and obligations in handling infectious disease outbreaks, public events and emergencies that have the potential to cross borders. In May 2022, Member States, including Australia, agreed at the World Health Assembly to establish a working group to consider targeted amendments to the IHR—the Working Group on Amendments to the IHR (WGIHR).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These amendments will enable the IHR to remain responsive to evolving public health threats and strengthen the ability of countries to co-operate internationally to prepare for and respond to infectious disease outbreaks. Australia is actively participating in negotiations through the WGIHR. Further information about the work of the WGIHR is available at www.who.int/health-topics/international-health-regulations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are working across both negotiation processes to ensure that reforms align with Government priorities and the national interest. The Government will consult widely across government, with Australian stakeholders and the community throughout negotiations to ensure Australia's and our region's interests are preserved and our priorities advanced.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Any new instrument or amendments to the IHR will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and consideration by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties (JSCOT). This includes Article 59 of the IHR, which was agreed by WHO Member States at the World Health Assembly in 2022. As part of its process in scrutinising proposed treaties, JSCOT undertakes further consultation by inviting submissions from stakeholders and members of the public. Any changes to Australian law to implement the new instrument or IHR amendments would also have to be considered and passed by Parliament.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is important to note that the Australian Constitution can only be changed by referendum, which requires a public vote by the people of Australia in accordance with the requirements of section 128 of the Constitution. The Government is not considering a referendum be held on this matter at this time.</span>
            </p>

I appreciate you bringing this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is strongly opposed to corruption in all its forms. Australia has a strong record of global, regional and domestic action to prevent and expose corrupt activity. Australian law enforcement and intelligence agencies are also working to stem the flow of illicit wealth into Australia.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for referring a copy of petition EN4242 presented to the House of Representatives on 7 November 2022, regarding the Intergovernmental Declaration on Children, Youth and Climate Action. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises young people's resilience, strength, and capacity to lead positive change, and believes that young people should be involved in the decisions that affect their lives and futures. Young Australians will feel the greatest effects of unmitigated climate change and are uniquely positioned to develop the solutions we need to combat the climate crisis. It is vital their input is sought and carefully considered on an issue inexorably linked to their futures, and that their perspectives are used to shape climate action that is inclusive, sustainable, and ambitious.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan agreed at COP27 recognised the role of children and youth as agents of change in addressing and responding to climate change. It encouraged Parties to include children and youth in their processes for designing and implementing climate policy and action, and, as appropriate, to consider including young representatives and negotiators into their national delegations, recognizing the importance of intergenerational equity and maintaining the stability of the climate system for future generations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia also welcomed the adoption of a four-year Action Plan under the Glasgow work programme on Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE). The Action Plan sets out short-term, clear, and time-bound activities in the four priority areas of the work programme and across the six elements of ACE in a balanced manner as a concrete step towards empowering all members of society, including children and youth, to engage in climate action. Australia is committed to taking actions to empower the voices of young people to drive ambitious climate action.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In line with this, the Australian Government recognises the participation of young Australians in climate action is key to our transition to becoming a clean energy economy and Australia's future as a renewable energy powerhouse. Australia is committed to promoting youth voices in international climate engagement, including at COP28.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's Office for Youth, with support from the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water, has established a Youth Advisory Group on Climate Change and COP28. This group is providing advice to the Australian Government and has been established to focus on our engagement on climate change internationally, specifically in relation to COP28 in Dubai in November, and Australia's bid to co-host COP31 with the Pacific.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to the Youth Advisory Group, the Australian Government continues to actively engage with a range of other youth groups, including Australian Youth for International Climate Engagement (AYFICE), Global Voices and UNICEF.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, later this year UNICEF and Monash University will partner to host an Australian Local Conference of Youth (LCOY) that will empower young Australians to contribute to the Conference of Youth (COY) held just before COP28.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We remain committed to empowering and supporting young Australians to continue to demonstrate leadership on climate action.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Medicare</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN4248 on Medicare levy payments. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Medicare levy was introduced to help offset the Australian Government's increased spending on health following the introduction of Medicare in 1984. The levy contributes to the Government's ability to fund the cost of Australia's public health system, in the same way as other sources of revenue such as income tax. The Medicare levy is currently imposed at a flat rate of 2 per cent on a person's taxable income.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">However, the Medicare levy low-income thresholds ensure that households do not pay Medicare levy if their taxable income is below a certain level, and the amount payable is phased-in over a certain income range.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Taxpayers with income between the low-income threshold and the phase-in limit pay a concessional amount of Medicare levy, which is determined as 10 per cent of taxable income exceeding the low-income threshold, and only begin to pay the full 2 per cent when their income exceeds the phase-in limit.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There are different low-income thresholds and phase-in limits for singles, couples, families with children, and seniors and pensioners. In 2022-23, a single person with no children will not be liable for Medicare levy if their taxable income does not exceed $24,276. A single person pays a concessional amount of Medicare levy if their income is above $24,276, and only pays the full 2 per cent when their income exceeds $30,345.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">These arrangements ensure that the liability of residents to pay the Medicare levy reflects their financial capacity to contribute to the total cost of national health care. This treatment is consistent with the progressive nature of the Australian income tax system, that is, those with higher incomes pay a larger share of tax.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information will be of assistance to you.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Yours sincerely</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your petition EN4267 dated 7 November 2022, concerning child support. I apologise for the lengthy delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government acknowledges the causes of suicide are complex and that reducing the number of lives lost requires the combined efforts of all governments and communities to address individual, social and economic drivers of distress. The National Suicide Prevention Office is coordinating a whole-of-government response and developing a National Suicide Prevention Strategy which will address the social determinants of suicide, with a focus on communities who are disproportionately impacted by these issues.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is aware of the difficulties that are faced by parents who experience family breakdown, including the stress of disputes in relation to child support. The Government intends for the Child Support scheme to be fair to ensure children are financially supported by both parents.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A key principle of the Child Support scheme is that parents share in the costs of supporting their children according to their financial capacity. For this reason, child support assessments are generally based on the child support formula, which calculates how much child support is payable by considering each parents' income, the number, ages, and care arrangements for the children in the assessment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additional income such as overtime is included for child support purposes, which generally results in child support payments increase to reflect the change in circumstances. This policy helps to ensure parents are supporting their children in line with their financial capacities at any given time.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The child support formula determines how much child support is payable by calculating each parent's child support percentage. A parent's child support percentage represents the share of the costs of the children they are required to meet, based on their share of combined income, and less their contribution to the costs of the children through care. If a parent's child support percentage is greater than zero, they will be liable to pay child support.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This means that where both parents have equal care of a child, but different incomes, one parent may be required to pay child support. The child support formula is designed in this way to ensure that children are supported by both parents in accordance with their financial capacity (that is, the formula does not quarantine part of one parent's income from being assessed because they have equal shared care).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petitioner may be interested to know that in the 2023-24 Budget, the Government committed $5.1 million to implement key child support recommendations made by the Joint Select Committee on Australia's Family Law System (committee). The key interests of the committee were to ensure the Child Support scheme balances the interests of separated parents, reflects current community standards, and importantly, continue supporting the best interests of children. The committee's report and the Government's response (tabled on 25 January 2023) is available at    <br clear="all">.</br>www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Joint/Family_Law_System.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of the Government's response to the committee's recommendations, the Government agreed to a range of recommendations to improve the Child Support Scheme over the longer term, including the following:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      22.7pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The Government has established a Child Support Stakeholder Consultation Group who will perform a key advisory role for Government on a range of policy and service delivery issues that impact the efficient operation of the Scheme, and positive outcomes for separated parents.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      22.7pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet"> In response to Recommendations 14, 18 and 19 of the Committee's Third Interim Report, the Government has agreed to establish a Child Support Expert Panel, and commission research into the costs of raising children in Australia. The Expert Panel will review the costs of children findings to make recommendations on whether and how to update the Costs of the Children Table (and formula), including the self-support amount.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

Decisions about including funded supports in an NDIS plan are determined by the support needs of the NDIS participant and they are set out in the plan developed with them. The type of support depends on the needs of the child with developmental delay or disability and the preferences of their family about how these supports are delivered and who delivers them.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your petition EN4342 of 7 November 2022 to the Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme and Minister for Government Services, the Hon Bill Shorten MP, regarding child support. The petition was referred to me as this matter falls within my portfolio responsibilities. I apologise for the lengthy delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is aware of the difficulties that are faced by parents who experience family breakdown, including the stress of disputes in relation to child support. The Government intends for the Child Support scheme to be fair to ensure children are financially supported by both parents.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A key principle of the Child Support scheme is that parents share in the costs of supporting their children according to their financial capacity. For this reason, child support assessments are generally based on the child support formula, which calculates how much child support is payable by considering each parents' income, the number, ages, and care arrangements for the children in the assessment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The child support formula uses the Costs of the Children Table which identifies the costs of the children based on the parents' combined child support income as well as the number and age of the children in the assessment. The Costs of the Children Table was based on extensive research into how much parents spend on children. The research found that expenditure on children is different in households with different income levels, numbers of children and children of different ages.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">More information on the research can be found in the publication <span style="font-style:italic;">In the Best Interests of Children -Reforming the Child Support Scheme </span>at www.dss.gov.au/our-resgonsibilities/families-and-children/publications-articles.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petitioner may be interested to know that in the 2023-24 Budget, the Government committed $5.1 million to implement key child support recommendations made by the Joint Select Committee on Australia's Family Law System (committee). The key interests of the committee were to ensure the Child Support scheme balances the interests of separated parents, reflects current community standards and, importantly, continues supporting the best interests of children. The committee's report and the Government's response (tabled on 25 January 2023) are available at    <br clear="all">.</br>www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Joint/Family_Law_System.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of the Government's response to the committee's recommendations, the Government agreed to a range of recommendations to improve the Child Support Scheme over the longer term, including the following:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      22.7pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The Government has established a Child Suppo1t Stakeholder Consultation Group who will perform a key advisory role for Government on a range of policy and service delivery issues that impact the efficient operation of the Scheme, and positive outcomes for separated parents.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      22.7pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet"> In response to Recommendations 14, 18 and 19 of the Committee's Third Interim Report, the Government has agreed to establish a Child Support Expert Panel, and commission research into the costs of raising children in Australia. The Expert Panel will review the costs of children findings to make recommendations on whether and how to update the Costs of the Children Table (and formula), including the self-support amount.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I appreciate you bringing this matter to the Government's attention.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 23 November 2022 to the Hon Tanya Plibersek MP, Minister for the Environment and Water, presenting petition number EN4404 relating to seismic testing in Australian waters. Your email was referred to me on 21 August 2023 as the Minister responsible for Resources.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to protecting our marine environment and enforcing safe and environmentally sustainable practices by the oil and gas sector, now and in the future. Seismic testing in Australia is regulated by Australia's independent expert regulator, the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (NOPSEMA). NOPSEMA's staff include qualified technical experts with extensive experience in offshore environmental impact and risk management, marine ecology, and environmental science.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A proposed seismic survey cannot proceed unless the impacts and risks associated with the activity have been evaluated and controls adopted to reduce those impacts and risks to as low as reasonably practicable and acceptable levels. If the environmental impacts of a specific seismic survey cannot be managed, NOPSEMA will not allow the activity to proceed. Where the scientific understanding of the potential impacts of a seismic survey is limited, NOPSEMA applies precaution to its regulatory decision-making.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) has a number of COVID-19 measures in place. The NDIA continues to support participants and their families to receive the disability support they need from the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS); and to ensure NDIS providers are equipped to offer these supports, including during periods where the continuity of those supports has been affected by COVID-19 restrictions. These measures have been and continue to support NDIS participants to access the early intervention services funded in their plans, where those supports may have been disrupted due to COVID-19.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Families who have not been able to use funding in their child's plan or have used less funding because of COVID-19 disruptions will not be disadvantaged with their next plan. Their next plan will set out the goals and include the disability-related supports their child requires. They will not have their disability support needs assessed against the expenditure of funds from any previous plan. The funds available in their current plan will continue to be available, including those funds that may have been unspent due to COVID-19 impacts. Until such time as the plan is replaced with the child's next NDIS Plan.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 8 November 2022 regarding petition referral EN4474 on unpaid, full-time, mandatory placement requirements in university degrees. I understand that due to a technical error, there was a delay in a number of petitions reaching my office.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government acknowledges the difficulties many students experience with meeting the cost of living while studying and completing mandatory placements. Through the 2023-24 Budget, the Government increased support available through Austudy, ABSTUDY, Youth Allowance and provided access to more Government Rent Assistance. These payments support Australians of all ages to attend university.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I recognise the current system may not enable some Australians to access or complete a higher education degree. This is why the Government is committed to delivering an Australian Universities Accord through a review of the higher education system. The Accord Panel has released its interim report, which acknowledges the challenges associated with unpaid student placements, particularly on students from low SES and regional backgrounds and students who have caring responsibilities.

The Government's view is that content should be regulated consistently and that outright bans for specific forms or genres of content are not appropriate.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the National Classification Scheme, films, computer games and certain publications, including those accessed online, must be classified before they can be legally made available to the Australian public. Films and computer games are given a classification to indicate suitable audience, and consumer advice to provide information about the strongest content.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Some classifications are age-restricted, providing additional protections. For films, content that is classified MA15+ is restricted to persons 15 years and over unless the person is accompanied by an adult. Content that is classified R18+ is legally restricted to adults aged 18 years and over. For films there is also an Xl8+ category that is specific to sexually explicit content (pornography).</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The hosting of online material by Australian online service providers is regulated under the Online Safety Act 2021 (the Act). The eSafety Commissioner has powers to request or require takedown of illegal and restricted online content. For example, the eSafety Commissioner can respond to X18+ material hosted in Australia by issuing a removal notice to the service provider. For other material that is not appropriate for children such as material classified as Rl8+, the eSafety Commissioner can require that it be placed behind a Restricted Access System to limit its access to those aged 18 and above.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The eSafety Commissioner can assess content, and if it is likely that the material would be refused classification, eSafety can issue a notice to compel service providers to remove it. Service providers that fail to act on an eSafety notice within 24 hours can be liable for significant financial penalties. Furthermore, eSafety can seek a Federal Court order to remove access to online services that continually disregard eSafety notices.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the Act, industry is also being expected to do more to keep Australians safe, particularly children. The Act requires that online service providers develop updated industry codes to address harmful online content. The eSafety Commissioner is currently working with the industry to develop these codes.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">To assist parents and carers to keep their children safe, the eSafety Commissioner also provides a range of online safety resources for parents and young people, providing parents with up-to-date information about parental controls and software tools that can limit what children do or see online. This includes options to filter different kinds of content, such as age-inappropriate content. Free online webinars, downloadable books, information sheets and resources with easy to follow advice can be found at www.esafety.gov.au/parents.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 28 November 2022 regarding Petition-EN4521.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There is no more important job than being a teacher and Australia needs more of them. That is why the Government is committed to supporting alternative pathways into teaching, including for mid-career entrants. Alternative pathways broaden the entry points into the teaching profession by allowing individuals to work while they complete their teaching qualification. The Government is supporting these diverse entry points into teaching through a range of mechanisms, including the High Achieving Teachers (HAT) Program.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The HAT Program offers 2 alternative, employment-based pathways into teaching for high-achieving individuals committed to pursuing a career in the teaching profession.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government currently contracts Teach For Australia and La Trobe University under the HAT Program. These programs fast-track participants into classrooms and enable them to earn a salary while completing a Master's qualification. Each pathway proactively recruits and selects high-achieving graduates with the knowledge, skills and experience that schools need. Program participants are placed in teaching positions in Australian secondary schools experiencing teacher workforce shortages and receive a high degree of training and support.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further, all Education Ministers agreed to the National Teacher Workforce Action Plan (the Action Plan) on 15 December 2022, which includes actions designed to increase the number of people choosing to become teachers and ensure that existing teachers remain in the profession. Under the Action Plan, the HAT Program will be expanded with an additional 1,500 places to encourage more professionals to switch careers to teaching.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under Action 9 of the Action Plan, the Australian Council of Deans of Education is developing a framework in consultation with Universities Australia, higher education providers and teacher regulatory authorities to recognise previous study, work experience and skills that may be transferable to teaching.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The framework will include measures to ensure First Nations people, mid-career professionals and paraprofessionals can have their skills, expertise and prior learning recognised through credit towards their qualification, while maintaining robust teacher qualification requirements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further, under Action 8 of the Action Plan, the Government established the Teacher Education Expert Panel (the Panel) in September 2022 to provide advice on how to improve initial teacher education (ITE) to better prepare beginning teachers for the classroom.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 6 February 2023 regarding petition EN4650, the recognition of the importance of pedestrian and bike infrastructure and its benefits. I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government makes significant investments in land transport infrastructure across Australia through its infrastructure investment pipeline, including for projects which include active transport components. The Government recognises that active transport not only contributes towards creating positive health and wellbeing outcomes, but also supports the tourism sector and drives economic development more broadly.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In recognition of the multiple benefits of active transport, the Government works closely with state and territory and local governments on the selection and development of road infrastructure projects with active transport components. However, it is important to recognise that the design, project deployment and funding of cycling and pedestrian infrastructure is primarily the responsibility of state and territory and local governments.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">
                <span style="font-style:italic;">
                </span>The Government has committed $976.4 million to the Road Safety Program (RSP) over the next two financial years, to fund projects via the state and territory governments to deliver road safety upgrades across the National Road Network. These projects will include delivery of upgrades and improvements for vulnerable road users, particularly on urban footpaths and cycleways, reducing risk of serious injury and road crashes, which align with the key priorities of the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Road Safety Strategy 2021-30 </span>and the <span style="font-style:italic;">National Road Safety Action Plan 2023- 25.</span></span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To improve protections for footpath and cycleway users, and to reduce fatalities and serious injuries, RSP funding recipients must present projects that improve safety for vulnerable road users and demonstrate how these treatments will increase safety, particularly on footpaths and cycleways.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Up to 20% of urban works funding under the RSP must be dedicated to safety treatments that focus on protections for pedestrians and cyclists. This may include separation of cyclists from vehicles and pedestrians, protections for mobility vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians and School Zone projects. Funding recipients are also strongly encouraged to consider works for vulnerable road users in regional and remote locations. No minimum threshold will be applied to these types of projects.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Notably, the $3.25 billion Local Roads and Community Infrastructure (LRCI) Program also supports local councils to deliver priority local road and community infrastructure projects across Australia, supporting jobs and delivering benefits to local communities. Since 2020, more than 10,000 projects have been approved under Phases 1-4. Approximately 33 per cent of all LRCI projects are road projects, 62 per cent are community infrastructure and 5 per cent involve a combination of road and community upgrades. Of these, approximately 8 per cent will contribute to active transport such as upgrades to cycling or walking paths.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence referring petition EN4687, which requests that the House of Representatives make changes to its petitions system to improve public accountability for government responses to petitions. I apologise for the delay in responding, due to the delayed transmission of the petition to my office.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Firstly, I note that there are accountability measures in the current House petitions system. As you know, the Petitions Committee is empowered under Standing Order 209 to refer a petition to the Minister responsible for the administration of the matters raised in the petition. The Minister is then expected to provide a written response within 90 days. I understand that the Committee is currently reviewing its procedures for the referral of petitions to Ministers and, I'm sure, will report any changes to the House in due course.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Another important accountability measure is the publication of petitions and Ministers' responses to petitions on the Parliament's website at: www.aph.gov.au/e-petitions. Once presented in the House, all petitions and responses are published on the website. This allows members of the public to easily track petitions and the government's response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The right of petitioning Parliament remains a fundamental right of citizens and the only means by which the individual can directly place grievances before Parliament. I certainly encourage all Australians to consider using the petitions process to bring matters to the attention of the Parliament.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing to me on this matter.</span>

While Australia welcomes foreign investment, the Government recognises that we have a responsibility to ensure incoming investment is not contrary to our national interest (including national security). Investment proposals are examined on a risk-based approach and in light of various criteria for assessing the national interest (e.g. impact on the economy and community, competition, character of the investor, and other government policies such as tax and impact on national security).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's policy regarding foreign investment in residential property is to channel foreign investment into new residential dwellings, as opposed to established dwellings, so as to create additional jobs in the construction industry and to bolster Australia's housing stock. Foreign persons generally require foreign investment approval before acquiring an interest in residential land and are also generally prohibited from purchasing established housing.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There is an exception for temporary residents, who will generally be allowed to purchase one established dwelling to use as their principal place of residence while they live in Australia. If a temporary resident is approved to purchase an established dwelling, it will generally be approved with a number of conditions attached to that approval, one of which is that the temporary resident must sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of their interest in the property within six months from when it ceases to be their principal place of residence, or they cease to be a temporary resident (other than by becoming a permanent resident), whichever occurs first. Temporary residents are also required to pay application fees which start at $13,200 for residential properties up to $1 million and increase in increments of $13,200 for each additional $1 million of consideration.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Taxation Office is responsible for screening foreign investment in residential real estate and monitoring compliance. It has an effective compliance program to detect failures by foreign persons to apply for approval and where they breach conditions in their approvals. Since taking office, the Government has, in addition to doubling foreign investment application fees, doubled penalties for breaches of the foreign investment framework relating to residential property.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Foreign acquisitions of Australian agricultural land or agricultural land entities will generally not be granted unless Australian investors are offered an equal opportunity to invest in that land or entity through an open and transparent sales process. Foreign government investors require approval for all acquisitions of agricultural land, regardless of their cumulative holdings or the consideration of the proposed investment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Maintaining strong compliance with Australia's foreign investment legislation is a priority for the Australian Government, to ensure that foreign investment is not contrary to the national interest (including national security).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Our compliance and enforcement powers allow us to prevent, identify and respond to instances of non- compliance, and include the power to direct investors to take or cease particular actions.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 27 March 2023 to the Minister for Resources, the Hon Madeleine King MP, concerning petition EN4806 on fracking in the Surat Basin, Queensland. Your correspondence has been referred to me as the matter raised falls within my portfolio responsibilities as the Minister for the Environment and Water.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Any new gas development referred to my department will be subject to a rigorous, evidence-based assessment of its likely impacts on matters protected under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 </span>(EPBC Act). Where relevant, this also includes consideration of potential impacts from greenhouse gas emissions on matters protected under the EPBC Act. Proposals must receive all necessary environmental approvals before they can proceed and proponents should also work with relevant communities and First Nations peoples to realise social and economic benefits.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 17 May 2023 about a petition lodged with the Standing Committee on Petitions (petition number EN4826) calling for a parliamentary inquiry in relation to the Chalumbin Wind Farm project, Ravenshoe, Queensland.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I understand that the community has concerns regarding the Chalumbin Windfarm project. The project is being assessed by a public environment report (PER) under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 </span>(EPBC Act). The EPBC Act process will ensure adequate consideration of the issues identified in the request for parliamentary inquiry. These issues include concerns around environmental impacts, community consultation, and impacts on communities and cultural heritage.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The PER assessment approach requires the proponent to undertake a rigorous environmental assessment of all potential impacts on matters protected under the EBPC Act. As required under the EPBC Act, the public were provided an opportunity to comment on the draft PER, with comments due by 9 January 2023. The proponent is required to summarise the public comments and address them in the final PER.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 17 May 2023 to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator the Hon Murray Watt, about petition EN4827 proposing Commonwealth heritage recognition and protection of brumbies. Your email has been referred to me as the Minister for the Environment and Water, as the matter you have raised falls within my portfolio responsibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you would be aware, the debate about brumbies, or feral horses, has particularly focussed on their presence in the Australian Alps, which is listed and protected as a National Heritage place under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 </span>(EPBC Act).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While I recognise the connection some Australians have with these horses, their presence in the Australian Alps threatens National Heritage values, listed threatened species and ecological communities, and wetlands of international importance ( Ramsar sites), all of which are protected under the EPBC Act as matters of national environmental significance. Specifically, feral horses are known to trample bogs and wetlands, spread weeds, overgraze grasslands and erode waterways. The impact that invasive vertebrate pests, including horses, have on native species is reflected in the listing of 'novel biota and their impact on biodiversity' as a key threatening process under the EPBC Act.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you would be aware, on 9 February 2023, following a motion by Senator David Pocock, the Senate referred the impacts and management of feral horses in the Australian Alps for inquiry and report by 29 September 2023. The inquiry will be conducted by the Senate Standing Committee on Environment and Communications.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water has provided a submission to the inquiry. It can be accessed at submission 23 on the inquiry's webpage    <br clear="all">.</br>www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Environment_and_Communications/FeralHorses47/Submissions. The submission highlights the Australian Government's position that feral horses are impacting matters protected under Australia's national environmental legislation. There is an urgent need for the land managers to actively manage feral horse numbers through improved implementation of existing legislation, policies and plans for the protection of the environment and heritage in the Australian Alps.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Protecting Australia's unique environment is important to the Australian Government and to the people of Australia. The Australian Government does not support the protection of feral horses as a heritage value.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I welcome the inquiry to ensure that we are doing everything we can to effectively protect our precious alpine environment from the impacts of feral horses.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I thank the Standing Committee on Petitions for bringing this matter to the government's attention.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 17 May 2023 regarding petition number EN4859 requesting the reinstatement of the no referral policy from a medical practitioner for PCR tests at pathology or swab collection sites.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to supporting effective COVID-19 testing to limit the spread and ensure that those most at risk of severe disease, including people with complex underlying health conditions and the immunocompromised, have fast access to care and treatments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer you to my 19 April 2023 response to petition number EN4688. In that response, I indicated that access to COVID-19 PCR tests funded under the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) has remained unchanged throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. A request (referral) from a medical or nurse practitioner has always been a requirement for MBS funded COVID-19 tests (like all other MBS funded pathology tests). A request for a pathology test, including a COVID-19 test, can be made through a telehealth consultation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Throughout the pandemic, states and territories have conducted COVID-19 PCR testing without the need for a request. The National Partnership on COVID-19 Response has provided states and territories with funding for PCR testing on a 50:50 cost shared basis. This Partnership ceased on 31 December 2022. In accordance with the testing strategy outlined in the National COVID-19 Health Management Plan (National Plan) for 2023, from 1 January 2023, the new National Partnership for Priority Populations for Testing and Vaccination provides funding to states and territories on a 50:50 cost-shared basis to target PCR testing to those most at risk of severe COVID-19 and death, including the immunocompromised. The National Plan can be viewed on the Department of Health and www.health.gov.au by searching for 'National COVID-19 Health Management Plan for 2023'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under both the previous and the new National Partnership arrangements, people do not need a referral to access a PCR test through a state and territory testing clinic. State and territory governments continue to provide PCR testing for vulnerable persons who are at risk of severe COVID-19 disease and who are eligible for access to antiviral treatments at state and territory health facilities. Patients who need antivirals can also obtain them through a telehealth consultation and a positive rapid antigen test.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for referring petition EN4977 about exemptions from compulsory voting and removing fines for individuals who fail to vote. I am responding as Special Minister of State, responsible for electoral matters.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has one of the most accessible, reliable, and transparent electoral systems in the world. The Albanese Government is committed to strengthening the integrity of our electoral system and considers voter confidence in electoral processes imperative to our functioning democracy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Labor Party has led legislation for significant federal electoral reform in Australia. Reforms by the Hawke Government in the 1980s provided the framework for Australia's contemporary elections and our democracy. Importantly, that Government transformed our democratic institutions with the creation of the independent Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) to conduct and oversee elections. It also increased transparency in our democratic system by introducing a regime for the regulation and disclosure of political donations and electoral expenditure.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The count process in federal elections is detailed and conducted in a highly transparent manner, with the scrutiny held over a number of weeks. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 </span>(Electoral Act} and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Referendum (</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Machinery</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Provisions) Act 1984 </span>(Referendum Act} contain legislative safeguards to support the integrity of the Australian electoral system, including processes for check and balances on the scrutiny. This involves the AEC conducting an initial sorting of pre-poll votes, scrutiny on voting night and fresh scrutiny. The AEC's operations and procedures, including the Ballot Paper Principles and Ballot Paper Handling Policy, mean that at all times, all ballot papers are tracked, secure and accounted for. More information is available on the AEC's website: www.aec.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Protecting the integrity of Australia's electoral processes is critical to maintaining public trust in Australia's democratic processes. The Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce (EITA) was established for the 2022 Federal Election to provide information and advice to the Electoral Commissioner on matters that may compromise the real or perceived integrity of the federal election. The EITA is made up of relevant agencies across federal government working together within their own remits. More information on the EITA is available at: https://www.aec.gov.au/about_aec/electoral-integrity.htm.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, ahead of the 2022 Federal Election, the AEC re-established their 'Stop and Consider Campaign', which builds on the success of a similar campaign run at the 2019 federal election that aims to help voters cut through mis- and disinformation. The AEC also established a disinformation register that lists prominent pieces of disinformation regarding the election process, detailing when the communication was brought to the AEC's attention and actions taken. Similar registers exist at the state and territory level to combat mid and dis information about elections. For example, the NSW Electoral Commission's disinformation register is available at: elections.nsw.gov.au/integrity/disinformation-register.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition requests the abolition of compulsory voting. Compulsory voting is the cornerstone of Australian democracy. The Electoral Act and the Referendum Act require all eligible Australian citizens to enrol and vote at each election and referendum. Compulsory voting has been part of Australian federal elections since 1924. The Government supports compulsory voting as it strengthens our democratic process and ensures that the vast majority of citizens actively participate in elections.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition ENS044 to introduce a Home Rescue Guarantee scheme.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Government recognises the importance of the residential construction sector to the national economy. The residential construction sector is under pressure as it continues to address the effects of the pandemic, supply chain disruptions, labour shortages, rising interest rates and significant price rises for key inputs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There is a large pipeline of construction work across Australia which means that demand for construction materials and labour remains at elevated levels. However, while house construction input prices continued to rise in the June quarter, this is the fourth consecutive quarter that the pace of growth slowed, as supply chain improvements and falling demand for new construction allow for the backlog of housing to be worked through.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The availability of materials and labour in the construction industry is not expected to ease until around late 2023 to early 2024. Commonwealth, state and territory Building Ministers have noted the significant economic challenges facing the building industry including supply chain, cost and workforce pressures, which have contributed to insolvencies in the sector.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government acknowledges the difficult circumstances faced by customers impacted by insolvencies in the residential construction industry, including Porter Davis. Ultimately, regulation of the building industry is a matter for state and territory governments. On 20 April 2023, the Victorian Government announced compensation for customers of Porter Davis who signed their contracts and paid deposits but where Porter Davis did not take out Domestic Building Insurance. The Victorian Government also announced that the Victorian Building Authority is investigating Porter Davis Homes for potential breaches of the law.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 31 March 2023, Grant Thornton Australia were appointed liquidators of 14 companies in the Porter Davis Homes Group. Any inquiries about the progress of the liquidation or concerns regarding a specific liquidation matter can be raised with the liquidators in the first instance. If this fails to resolve concerns, a complaint may be lodged with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Commonwealth, state and territory senior officials and the Australian Building Codes Board have undertaken work to identify factors constraining the market at the moment, as well as possible opportunities to bolster capacity and alleviate cost pressures. Officials will continue to update this work and report to Commonwealth, state and territory Building Ministers with further work to ensure all possible responses to this critical issue can be considered.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN5058.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government provides a range of support to not-for-profit entities through the tax system in recognition of their valuable contribution to Australian society. This includes exempting employment associations, trade unions and other employee associations, and employer associations from income tax. This puts these organisations on the same footing as other not-for-profit entities such as community service organisations, sporting clubs and industry and tourism promotion bodies.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Trade unions and other employee associations are exempt from income tax only if they comply with all the requirements of their governing rules and apply their income and assets solely for the purpose for which they are established. From the 2023-24 tax year, not-for-profit entities (other than registered charities) claiming to be exempt from income tax will need to provide a return to the Australian Taxation Office establishing their eligibility.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is a longstanding feature of the tax system that periodic subscriptions paid for the membership of a trade, business or professional association (such as union fees) are generally accepted as deductible. Additional membership costs that do not qualify for the general deduction, such as joining fees, may also be deductible up to an annual maximum of $42 for each association.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN5062 on petrol prices.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises that the cost of fuel is putting family and business budgets under significant pressure and driving up the price of essentials like groceries. It remains critical that fuel companies promptly pass on reductions in international oil prices.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is responsible for monitoring fuel prices and plays a critical role in ensuring that market participants do not take advantage of consumers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the independent regulator enforcing Australia's competition and consumer laws, the ACCC investigates concerns about misrepresentations regarding fuel prices, and false and misleading conduct or anti- competitive conduct in fuel markets, and takes appropriate action. In addition, the ACCC engages with major retailers and wholesalers to ensure that they do not mislead Australian consumers about the rationale for any price rises. ACCC surveillance has consistently found that local prices tend to follow international prices.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While we understand that petrol price volatility is putting pressure on many Australians, prices have come down significantly since the peak in the middle of 2022. The most recent Australian Bureau of Statistics monthly consumer price index (released 28 June 2023) recorded an average 8 per cent decrease in fuel prices in the year to May 2023. Prices at the end of the 2022-23 financial year had fallen substantially in all capital cities from the 2022 peaks, with the biggest falls seen in Melbourne (of 55.3 cents per litre), Perth (of 48.0 cents per litre), Brisbane (of 46.3 cents per litre) and Sydney (of 44.4 cents per litre).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government considers the ACCC best placed to continue monitoring petrol prices. I trust this information will be of assistance.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 20 June 2023 regarding Petition EN5075—eating disorders, more research and resources for anorexia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I acknowledge the substantial impact eating disorders have on mental, physical, and psychological wellbeing of individuals, as well as on their families and carers. As eating disorders have one of the highest mortality rates of any mental illness, more needs to be done across all sectors to prevent them and improve access to treatment. Access to treatment and supports that is evidence-based is of critical importance to the Australian Government.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">To support prevention of eating disorders and promote positive body image, the Government has committed $650,000 to the Butterfly Foundation s Body Bright Program. The Body Bright Program is an education program that promote healthy attitudes and behaviours towards the body, food, and physical exercise in primary school aged children. The Body Bright Program has been well received and continues to build young Australian's capacity to cope with social media exposure.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Through the 2023-24 Budget, the Government announced $6.2 million to support the Embrace Kids Australia program. The Embrace Kids Australia program aims to improve the body image of children and young people and prevent the development of eating disorders. The activities will support schools, sporting clubs, and families to cultivate a body-positive culture.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government also continues to support Eating Disorders Families Australia's Strive program, to provide education, learning and peer support to parents, carers, and families of people with eating disorders.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In 2022, the Government provided $13 million to the University of Sydney (InsideOut Institute) to establish the Australian Eating Disorder Research and Translation Centre to progress key eating disorder research priorities related to prevention, early identification, and treatment. This aims to improve outcomes for people with an eating disorder.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A further $63 million has been invested to establish community-based residential eating disorder treatment centres across Australia, including funding for treatment centre at Wandi Nerida on the Sunshine Coast, Queensland.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN5077 on the Stage 3 tax cuts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's position on the Stage 3 tax cuts has not changed. Our responsible economic and fiscal management is delivering a stronger and more sustainable fiscal position.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's immediate priority is to focus on dealing with the economic challenges facing us now. Through measures announced in the 2023-24 Budget, the Government is providing cost of living relief that is responsible and affordable and prioritises those most in need: energy bill relief, tripling bulk billing incentives, delivering cheaper medicines, expanded access to Parenting Payment (Single), increased support for people on working age and student payments and more affordable housing.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is improving the budget position in a measured way by strengthening the fairness and sustainability of the tax system. In addition to multinational integrity measures announced in the 2022-23 October Budget, the Government announced in the 2023-24 Budget the implementation of a global and domestic minimum tax rate of 15 per cent for large multinational enterprises. We are also introducing changes to the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax that will mean the offshore LNG industry will pay more tax and sooner. The May Budget also includes better targeting of superannuation concessions by reducing tax concessions available to individuals whose superannuation balance exceeds $3 million. These tax measures will help to ensure a fair and sustainable tax base.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for referring petition EN5087 about the examination of federal elections and preferential voting. I am responding as the Special Minister of State, responsible for electoral matters.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Reforms to Australia's federal electoral system have been led by Labor Governments. In the 1980s the Hawke Government provided the framework for Australia's contemporary elections and democracy. By creating an independent electoral commission to conduct elections, that Government transformed our democratic institutions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition presented here appears to seek that the Senate voting system allow a voter to cast a formal vote by numbering as few candidates on the Senate ballot paper as the voter wishes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Senate voting system was an issue examined by the federal parliament's multi-partisan Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters (JSCEM), in its inquiry into the 2013 federal election. Such an inquiry is usual after each general federal election.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A new voting system was recommended by JSCEM at the time and implemented through legislation by the Coalition Government. In 2016, the legislation's swift handling, passage and implementation despite a lack of support from the Labor Opposition, made it controversial.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At that time the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 </span>was amended to introduce partial optional preferential voting for the Senate. Under this system, a voter must sequentially number at least 12 candidates below the line on the Senate ballot paper or at least six parties or groups above the line on the Senate ballot paper. Vote-saving provisions mean a vote is not informal if the voter sequentially numbers just six preferences below the line or just one preference above the line.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This amendment also abolished Senate group voting tickets. This means the flow of a voter's preferences now goes only to the parties, groups, or candidates for which the voter explicitly expressed a preference on the ballot paper.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In 2016 the then Government was not concerned with receiving multi-partisan support for electoral change. However, it is my view that significant changes to Australia's federal election laws are best pursued when there is support from across the Parliament. Broad discussion and viewpoints help to improve final legislation and provide greater confidence in effective implementation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As such, last year I requested JSCEM inquire into the 2022 federal election. I asked JSCEM to consider a range of issues, including proportional representation of the states and territories in the parliament, in the context of the critical democratic principle of 'one vote, one value'. JSCEM's final report is expected this year, with its progress reported at https://www.aph.gov.au/em.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Labor fought for greater fairness and transparency in our electoral system from Opposition, and now from Government we will continue the legacy of reform. As Special Minister of State, I am keenly interested in the outcomes of this JSCEM and moving towards long overdue reforms in our electoral system through broad discussions across the parliament.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing the concerns referred to in the petition to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Yours sincerely</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 20 June 2023 regarding petition EN5097 relating to a request to review the definition of 'person with a disability' in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Copyright Act 1968 </span>(Copyright Act) to ensure it covers 'difficulty physically accessing' copyright material, consistent with Article 3(c) of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) <span style="font-style:italic;">Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired or Otherwise Print Disabled </span>(Marrakesh Treaty) (which was ratified by Australia on 10 December 2015). I welcome the opportunity to respond to this petition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to Australian copyright law working in a flexible way to encourage equitable access to copyright material by people with a disability in the same way as a person without a disability. The Copyright Act provides for two different copyright exceptions to facilitate the adaptation of copyright materials into an accessible format to assist those with a disability. These are a 'fair dealing' exception for individuals with a disability and any person assisting them (section 113E), and a specific exception for educational institutions and other not-for-profit organisations which have a principal function of assisting persons with a disability in cases where the material cannot be obtained in the required format within a reasonable time at an ordinary commercial price (section 113F).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the Copyright Act (subsection 10(1)), a 'person with a disability' is defined as follows:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">
                <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">'person with a disability </span>means a person with a disability that causes the person difficulty in reading, viewing, hearing or comprehending copyright material in a particular form.'</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This definition was inserted in 2017 through amendments made by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Copyright Amendment (Disability Access and Other Measures) Act 2017. </span>This Act included a package of measures designed to enhance access to copyright material for persons with a disability, consistent with the Mairnkesh Treaty. As explained in the Explanatory Memorandum that accompanied the Copyright Amendment (Disability Access and Other Measures) Bill 2017 when it was being considered by Parliament:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">'This new definition is intended to account for a range of disabilities, consistent with the definition of disability as set out in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Disability Discrimination Act 1992, </span>and to allow flexibility for a wide range of conditions that would impact on an individual's ability to access copyright material. (p. 5)</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-Small">' ... in practice it would apply to anyone with a disability as defined in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Disability Discrimination Act 1992, </span>where that person's disability causes them difficulty in reading, viewing, hearing or comprehending copyright material.' (p. 13)</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the interpretation of the current definition has not been tested in the Australian courts, it is the Australian Government's view that the definition is broad enough to include a person with any form of disability contemplated by the Mairnkesh Treaty. This would include a person who is 'unable, through physical disability, to hold or manipulate a book or to focus or move the eyes to the extent that would be normally acceptable for reading' (as per Article 3(c) of the Marrakesh Treaty). There appears to be little doubt that this was the intention of the Parliament at the time the <span style="font-style:italic;">Copyright Amendment (Disability Access and Other Measures) Act 2017 </span>was passed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I am aware that, despite the positive changes to the Copyright Act made in 2017, it may be difficult in practice for Australians with some forms of disability to access a broad range of books in an accessible fo1mat that meets their needs. This may be due to various factors outside of copyright law, such as differing levels of awareness and commercial availability of particular accessible formats, or the resourcing or technical capability of those assisting persons with a disability. I commend the organiser of this petition for her efforts to raise awareness of the importance of making a wide variety of titles accessible to people with physical print disability who use Augmentative and Alternative Communication devices to access books. I also commend those in the publishing industry, education, library and broader not-for-profit sectors who are working to improve the availability of accessible books across various formats so that all Australians can share in the learning and enjoyment that books provide.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this info1mation is of assistance.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 19 June 2023 regarding petition EN5102 to not ban vaping products, nor to introduce any restrictions that would make it harder to purchase or use vaping products.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is taking clear action to reduce smoking and vaping rates through stronger legislation, enforcement, education and support.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has announced that it will strengthen the regulation and enforcement of both therapeutic and recreational vapes. Subject to further consultation with state and territory governments, a comprehensive range of reforms is proposed including:</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's announcement follows extensive public consultation led by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in late 2022 and agreement by all Health Ministers to work together to develop a comprehensive, coordinated suite of reforms to protect Australians from the harms of vaping. More information can be found at https://consultations.tga.gov.au/medicines-regulation-division/proposed-reforms-to-the-regulation-of-nicotine-vap.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The proposed reforms will not ban all vapes. Certain vapes will continue to be available with a doctor s prescription, where clinically appropriate for smoking cessation and the treatment of nicotine addiction. Further details regarding the scope and timeframes for the proposed reforms will be confirmed in consultation with relevant stakeholders, including the states and territories.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government's proposed approach aligns with the views of most leading public health organisations in Australia, including the Australian Medical Association, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP), the Cancer Council, and the National Health and Medical Research Council. It also accords with the latest advice on smoking cessation from the RACGP, which states that e-cigarettes should not be a first line treatment for smoking cessation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While some people may have successfully quit smoking using vapes, the overall evidence of the effectiveness of these products as a smoking cessation aid remains limited. E-cigarettes have been associated with a range of short-term health risks and their long-term health effects are unknown. E-cigarette marketing and use in the community has increased rapidly in recent years, particularly among young people and poses a major risk to population health and Australia's success in tobacco control. Ensuring that e-cigarettes are only accessed with medical supervision provides an opportunity for users to receive appropriate advice from health professionals on the risks associated with their use and the benefits of not smoking.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For people seeking additional support to quit smoking or vaping, a range of support services continue to be available through GPs, Quitline counsellors, pharmacists, and other specialists.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, a range of smoking cessation products approved by the TGA continue to be available, which do not carry the same health risks as vapes. These products have been rigorously assessed by the TGA, have an established safety and efficacy profile and are generally less addictive than vapes. Many are widely available in supermarkets and other retail settings. Products such as nicotine gums, patches and lozenges are also subsidised on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further information about these measures is available on the Department of Health and Aged Care's website at www.health.gov.au by searching 'tackling smoking and vaping'.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 1 August 2023 concerning petition number EN5106, regarding the use of mRNA vaccines in animals.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australian food safety is rightly one of the most respected in the world. That respect is based on the multi-layer and safety buffers that are applied. Importantly Australia's food safety is not reliant on any one single organisation. Responsibility for regulating the use of vaccines in production animals and food safety in animal products sits across several Australian Government entities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If mRNA vaccines for production animals are ever successfully developed, these entities will be responsible for determining whether they are safe and can be approved for use within Australia. There is a rigorous scientific process evaluating the safety and efficacy to protect the health and safety of people, animals and the environment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Before an agricultural or veterinary chemical product, such as a veterinary vaccine, can be legally used in a production animal environment in Australia, it must first be registered by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA), or approved for use under permit. The APVMA must be satisfied that all proposed agricultural and veterinary chemicals meet the statutory criteria for efficacy, safety (including the risks of residues in food), labelling, and trade prior to registration or approval. The statutory criteria for the use of mRNA vaccines in production animals is subject to the same rigorous process for vaccines produced using existing technology. More information about the role of the APVMA can be found at apvma.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, the Gene Technology Regulator has responsibility to protect the health and safety of people and the environment from risks posed by gene technology. As an independent statutory office holder, the Regulator would be involved in aspects of production and use of mRNA vaccines covered by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Gene Technology Act 2000. </span>Further information about the role of the Regulator can be found at: ogtr.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Meat, milk and dairy products from livestock that have been vaccinated with an approved Australian vaccine remain safe to eat. These vaccines are used to protect the health and welfare of animals and do not affect the safety of products derived from vaccinated animals. There is no reason to alter consumption of meat, milk and dairy products if mRNA vaccines are used in Australian animals in the future.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for raising this matter with me and for the valuable work undertaken by the Committee.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email regarding petition EN5121 on the conflict and humanitarian crisis in Sudan.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is deeply distressed by the ongoing violence in Sudan which has caused the needless deaths of many hundreds of people and had a profound humanitarian impact. Australia continues to call on all parties to permanently cease hostilities, return to negotiations and enable safe access for humanitarian supplies and workers. We have advocated this position in multilateral fora such as the UN Human Rights Council, as well as with Sudanese authorities and international partners.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We are committed to working with international partners to ease the humanitarian crisis caused by the conflict in Sudan. Australia announced $10.45 million in humanitarian assistance, consisting of $5.45 million to the International Committee of the Red Cross to provide essential humanitarian aid including food, water and emergency medical supplies, as well as $5 million to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to deliver lifesaving assistance across the region.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Department of Home Affairs continues to process complete applications for temporary, skilled and family visas from Sudanese nationals, as a priority. Applications lodged under the Special Humanitarian Program are prioritised on a case by case basis. On 14 February, more than 19,000 existing Temporary Protection Visa (TPV, Subclass 785) and Safe Haven Enterprise Visa (SHEV, Subclass 790) holders and applicants who had been found to engage</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's protection obligations, including Sudanese nationals, became eligible to apply for a permanent Resolution of Status (RoS, Subclass 851) Visa or have their TPV/SHEV application converted to a RoS visa application.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is providing support for the travel and resettlement of refugees, including those from Sudan, through our Humanitarian and Settlement Programs. Any person who believes they meet the requirements of a humanitarian visa and wishes to seek Australian's assistance can make an application. Each application is considered on its individual merit. Priority is given to the most vulnerable applicants who are assessed as refugees by the UNHCR and formally referred to Australia for resettlement, and those proposed by an immediate family member.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia will continue to work with international partners to urge a permanent end to the violence, a return to negotiations and safe access for humanitarian supplies and workers in Sudan. I thank the Petitions Committee for highlighting the traumatic circumstances faced by the people of Sudan due to this conflict.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN5128 on the pricing practices of the major supermarkets towards farmers. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises that greater competition is critical for lifting dynamism, productivity and wages growth, putting downward pressure on prices and delivering more choice for Australians dealing with cost-of-living pressures. It has therefore established a Competition Taskforce in Treasury to conduct a review of Australia's competition settings. The review will be progressed over two years, involve targeted public consultation, and provide continuous advice to the Government so progress can be made over time. Initial issues to be considered by the review include mergers reform, aviation and non-compete clauses that restrict workers from shifting to a better-paying job.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's competition laws are contained in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Competition and Consumer Act 2010 </span>(CCA), which allows competitive forces within the market to determine prices, while prohibiting anti- competitive conduct by businesses, such as price collusion. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is the agency responsible for enforcing these laws.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There is no direct prohibition on excessive pricing and the Government has a long-standing policy that it does not regulate prices along the supply chain. However, the Government has introduced the Food and Grocery Code of Conduct (the Code) to regulate the commercial dealings between the major supermarkets and their suppliers, including Australian farmers.</span>
            </p>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Code imposes obligations on the major supermarkets to improve certainty and transparency in their dealings with suppliers. For example, the supermarkets must engage in price negotiations with suppliers in good faith and take all reasonable steps to conclude negotiations without delay.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the Code, suppliers have access to Code Arbiters, who must take reasonable steps to investigate and resolve complaints. If a supplier is dissatisfied with the process undertaken by the Code Arbiter, they may request that the Independent Reviewer, Mr Chris Leptos AO, review the Code Arbiter's process in dealing with the complaint. Further information on the dispute resolution process is available on the Independent Reviewer's website at www.grocerycodereviewer.gov.au.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Disability Support Pension</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 1 August 2023, concerning petition no. EN5131 regarding the income test for Disability Support Pension (DSP) recipients. I hope the below information on DSP income test settings addresses the points raised in the petition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The DSP income test is designed to encourage people to supplement their income support payments with other income, if they are able to and wish to do so.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A DSP recipient and their partner can receive an amount of income before their payment starts to be reduced. This amount may comprise income from investments, earnings, or a combination of income from various sources and is known as the income free area. From 1 July 2023, the DSP income free area is $204 a fortnight for singles and $360 a fortnight for couples combined. The DSP income free area is adjusted each year in July for increases in the cost of living using the Consumer Price Index.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As noted in the petition, for each dollar of income over the income free area the single rate of DSP is reduced by 50 cents (the taper rate). For couples, each of their individual payments is reduced by 25 cents a fortnight for each dollar of income that the couple has over the income free area. This means that from 1 July 2023, a part rate of DSP is payable up to an assessable income of $2,332.00 a fortnight for a single person or $3,568.00 a fortnight for a couple. These figures may be higher if Rent Assistance is paid with the pension.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Working age payment recipients (such as DSP recipients who are under Age Pension age) are further incentivised to take up paid work where they can through the Working Credit arrangements. Recipients who have built up a Working Credit balance are able to use it to reduce the value of their earnings counted under the income test.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The operation of the DSP income free area, taper rate and Working Credit means that DSP recipients are better off while they (or their partner) are earning income in addition to their income support payments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">DSP recipients who have high earnings from employment or inform Services Australia they are starting work of 30 hours or more a week are able to have their DSP suspended for up to 2 years. This means if the person is unable to cope with the job, or needs to reduce their hours of work because of their disability, they can return to DSP without having to make a new claim.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Workforce Incentive) Act 2022, </span>from 1 January 2023, DSP recipients suspended due to work are also able to retain access to their Pensioner Concession Card and associated benefits for 2 years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I appreciate you bringing this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for the petition presented to the House of Representatives regarding military assistance to Ukraine. I appreciate the concerns raised by Mr Daugherty on these matters.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has repeatedly condemned Russia's unprovoked and illegal invasion of Ukraine and continues to call for its withdrawal from Ukrainian territory. The Government is providing military assistance to Ukraine to support its defence.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's military assistance to Ukraine now totals approximately $710 million. Australia's assistance package includes over 200 vehicles, artillery, ammunition and training for Ukrainian military recruits. Australia will also deploy an E-7A Wedgetail aircraft to help protect a vital gateway of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The international community is focussing on providing Ukraine only one fighter aircraft platform, namely the F-16. In addition to requiring Ukrainian training on a second aircraft, the F/A-18 Hornets are at an advanced stage of the disposal process and it is not feasible to return the aircraft to an operational state. The Government continues to consider options for further military assistance to Ukraine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information is of assistance.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 1 August 2023 regarding Petition EN5155 seeking to list Visanne(r) (dienogest) on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) for endometriosis.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is addressing endometriosis and pelvic pain, including specific clinics in general practice and improved access to medicines listed on the PBS and to medical services available via Medicare involved in the diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">One initiative involved a review of Medicare Benefits Schedule and PBS items used to support the diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis to be undertaken. The review will report on available treatments for endometriosis and pelvic pain and recommendations for both improved utilisation of items and promotion of available treatments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to ensuring Australians have access to affordable medicines by listing medicines recommended by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) on the PBS. The PBAC is an independent, expert body comprising doctors, health professionals, health economists and consumer representatives. Its primary role is to advise me, as the Minister for Health and Aged Care, about medicines and medicinal preparations that should be funded on the PBS. Under legislation, the Government cannot list a new medicine on the PBS unless the PBAC makes a recommendation in favour of its listing.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">When considering a medicine proposed for PBS listing, the PBAC is legally required to consider the comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the medicine compared to other available therapies. The PBAC's consideration is generally initiated by the pharmaceutical company responsible for supply of the medicine, as the pharmaceutical company usually holds the scientific data and other information necessary to inform the PBAC's consideration.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A stocktake of medicines listed on the PBS for the treatment of endometriosis and related conditions was considered by the PBAC in December 2022, to identify potential gaps between medicines subsidised through the PBS and medicines available to patients privately (at full cost). The PBAC noted that dienogest is Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) registered for endometriosis and its use is supported by clinical guidelines but is not PBS-subsidised.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The PBAC identified barriers to improving access to medicines used in the treatment of endometriosis, including the willingness of pharmaceutical companies to pursue a TGA registration and subsequent PBS listing for endometriosis. Further information about the PBAC's consideration and outcome is available at www.pbs.gov.au/info/industry/listing/elements/pbac-meetings/pbac-outcomes/recommendations-made-by-the-pbac-december-2022-intracycle.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, there are four brands of dienogest that are TGA-registered for use in Australia. The pharmaceutical company responsible for Visanne is Bayer Australia Ltd (Bayer), and the pharmaceutical company responsible for the other brands is Arrotex Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd (Arrotex).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Earlier this year, the Department of Health and Aged Care wrote to Bayer and Arrotex to seek an expression of interest in applying for the PBS listing of these products for the treatment of endometriosis. To date, the PBAC has not received a submission requesting the PBS listing of dienogest. You may wish to contact Bayer and Arrotex to find out if they intend to make a submission to the PBAC to list dienogest on the PBS for the treatment of endometriosis. Bayer can be contacted by phone on 1800 008 757 and Arrotex can be contacted on 1300 927 769.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Pharmaceutical companies are private businesses that makes their own decisions about the pricing of their medicines and whether they will market them exclusively on the private market or apply for subsidy through the PBS. The Government cannot compel pharmaceutical companies to seek PBS subsidies for their medicines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Where a medicine is not listed on the PBS, private health insurers are free to pay benefits, under general treatment cover, for the full price of the medicine. Health insurers may choose to offer this cover as a value-added feature of their policies, subject to any terms and conditions they choose to set. This is a commercial decision for the health insurer.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">All aspects of patient care, including recommendations about appropriate treatments, are the responsibility of the treating doctor. Individuals may wish to discuss with their treating doctor whether there are suitable treatment alternatives available for the treatment of their condition under the PBS.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has also established a National Women's Health Advisory Council (Council) to provide strategic advice and recommendations directly to Government to improve health outcomes for Australian women and girls. The Council will also provide advice on the implementation of the National Women's Health Strategy 2020-2030, which outlines a national approach to reducing inequalities and improving health outcomes for all women and girls particularly those at greatest risk of poor health.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 25 May 2023, the Senate Community Affairs Committee tabled its report on universal access to reproductive healthcare 'Ending the postcode lottery: addressing barriers to sexual, maternity and reproductive healthcare in Australia'. The Government is considering the recommendations in the report, which includes ensuring access to sexual and reproductive health medicines on the PBS and will respond in due course.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for writing on this matter. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is deeply concerned about the Wagner Group's operations and continues to closely monitor its involvement in Russia's war in Ukraine and beyond. Australia imposed targeted financial sanctions on the Wagner Group on 18 May 2022.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 1 August 2023 regarding petition number EN5159, which proposes a platform for remote overseas employees to raise employment issues.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Fair Work Act 2009 </span>(Fair Work Act) provides the framework for workplace relations in Australia. It also applies beyond Australia to Australian employers and employees.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Whether an employee working overseas for an Australian employer is classified as Australian-based or not depends on the individual circumstances, including where the employment contract was formed and whether they are engaged to perform duties outside Australia. An employee engaged outside Australia to perform duties outside Australia is generally not an Australian-based employee. Generally, Australian-based employees working overseas have entitlements under the national workplace relations system while non- Australian-based employees working overseas may be covered by the entitlements under the laws of the countries where they work.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Where the Fair Work Act applies, the Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) provides education, assistance and advice about Australian workplace laws, and, where appropriate, impartially enforces those laws. Contact details for the FWO, including a phone number for calling from outside Australia, can be found at www.fairwork.gov.au/about-us/contact-us.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence regarding petition EN5169, which requests the Australian Government implement the 2007 Parliamentary Inquiry into Breastfeeding. Specifically, that International Board-Certified Lactation Consultants (IBCLC) should be granted access to the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) as allied health professionals.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises the significant health benefits of breast feeding for both women and their babies and appreciates the expertise of skilled health professionals when assisting women to achieve their breastfeeding goals.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian National Breastfeeding Strategy: 2019 and beyond (Strategy) builds on the work of previous breastfeeding strategies to increase rates of breastfeeding in Australia. The Strategy provides a framework for integrated, coordinated action to provide supportive and enabling environments for breastfeeding. It identifies individual, community and structural enablers to support mothers and protect and promote breastfeeding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Since 2010, the MBS has supported participating midwives to provide quality care to patients by subsidising a range of private maternity services, including antenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal care. Postnatal attendances may include services relating to breastfeeding and there are IBCLC qualified midwives who provide this service as part of the postnatal attendance items.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The planning and delivery of public maternity services is predominantly undertaken by states and territories with the Australian Government providing national direction and supporting efforts to improve care and outcomes. Under the National Health Reform Agreement, the Australian Government provides a significant funding contribution to assist states and territories with the costs of public hospital and community health services, including maternity services.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is deeply concerned about the Wagner Group's operations and continues to closely monitor its involvement in Russia's war in Ukraine and beyond. Australia imposed targeted financial sanctions on the Wagner Group on 18 May 2022.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For an organisation to be listed as a terrorist organisation, it must satisfy the legislative criteria set out in Division 102 of the Criminal Code, namely that the organisation must be either directly or indirectly involved in preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act, or advocates the doing of a terrorist act.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you will appreciate, consideration of these matters are sensitive and complex. It is the Government's longstanding practice not to comment on whether an organisation is being, or has been, considered for listing.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing Petition EN5196 to my attention.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Pensions and Benefits</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for petition EN5211 dated 1 August 2023, concerning child support.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is aware of the difficulties that are faced by parents who experience family breakdown, including the stress of disputes in relation to child support. The Government intends the Child Support scheme be fair to ensure children are financially supported by both parents.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition suggests parents should only be entitled to receive child support if they are working full time (where possible). The Government appreciates that parents face difficult choices in balancing their desire to care for their children with the need to work to improve their family's financial situation. Families have a diversity of parenting arrangements and responsibilities and the Government supports these choices as far as possible. However, the Government understands that for child support purposes, the work decisions one parent makes can affect how much child support the other parent may pay or receive.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The policy settings for social security and family assistance payments support the Government's broader workforce participation agenda as well as supporting the policy position that parents should be encouraged to enter the workforce, or increase their hours of work as their children get older.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to child support, although the Government cannot force parents to make certain decisions about their lifestyle or employment, if either parent believes their child support assessment is unfair because of the special circumstances of their case, they can seek a review under the change of assessment process.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Services Australia can change an assessment based on a parent's earning capacity if the parent is not working despite ample opportunity to do so, or has changed their hours of work, and their decision is not justified by either their caring responsibilities or state of health.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petitioners also raise concerns about parental alienation, and that parents should not receive child support if the children do not have equal access to both parents. While the Government encourages involvement of both parents in their children's lives, the Child Support scheme does not play any role in establishing or enforcing care arrangements for children. Services Australia does not have the authority to compel parents to adhere to previously agreed, or negotiate with parents regarding, care arrangements. These issues are best dealt with through mediation or dispute resolution, or pursued through the family law system. The ongoing day-to-day financial support of children is the key objective of the Child Support scheme, and it is important that child support is not limited or withheld until access arrangements can be agreed.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the petitioners may be aware, the Family Relationship Advice Line (1800 050 321) is a free, national telephone service which provides assistance with family separation issues, as well as referrals to other services that can help parents strengthen relationships, overcome differences and assist with their specific needs. More information about Family Relationship Centres can be found at www.familyrelationships.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government shares concerns about 'undeclared cash' due to non-reporting or under-reporting of income for tax and other purposes. From 1 July 2019, the Government removed tax deductions to employers and payers of certain contractor payments, including cash wages where reporting obligations have not been met. The Government also established a tip-off line to report phoenixing, tax evasion and black economy activity and help keep the system fair for everyone. For more information about the Government's continuing work on the black economy, visit www.treasury.gov.au/policy-topics/economy/black-economy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For child support purposes, a parent's taxable income is used to assess how much child support a parent pays or receives. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is responsible for determining and verifying taxable income. If a source of income is assessed as taxable by the ATO, it is used by Services Australia to calculate child support assessments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">However, while a formula assessment reflects the needs of most separated families, sometimes the realities of a case mean the formula does not adequately address the circumstances of both parents and their children. If a parent believes that their former partner's taxable income is not an accurate reflection of their financial capacity, they may wish to discuss the option to apply for a change of assessment with Services Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition also raises 2 further areas of concern—the treatment of children from new relationships, and the costs of supporting step-children. When a parent is responsible for supporting a new biological or adopted child, the Child Support scheme recognises this financial responsibility through the 'relevant dependent child amount'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The 'relevant dependent child amount' reduces a parent's child support income, which can result in a change to the child support assessment, and ensures the parent has financial capacity to support all their children.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Where one parent's income decreases, it will reduce the cost of the children in the assessment and result in a change in each parent's income percentage. If the paying parent's income decreases due to the relevant dependent child amount, this may result in less child support being payable.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If the receiving parent's income decreases due to the relevant dependent child amount, this may result in a higher rate of child support being payable. However, this will be offset by the assessment having a lower child support liability overall due to lower combined child support income.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Child Support scheme is based on the principle that it is the biological or adoptive parents' responsibility to support their own children. For this reason, step-children are not automatically taken into account in the child support formula. Parents do not have a legal duty to support a step-child without a court order imposing such a duty. A parent can apply for a change of assessment in very limited circumstances to request that the financial support of a step-child is recognised as part of their child support assessment. For example, a parent would need to demonstrate that the step-child's own parents cannot financially support them for reasons such as ill-health or other caring responsibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petitioners may be interested to know that in the 2023-24 Budget, the Government committed $5.1 million to implement key child support recommendations made by the Joint Select Committee on Australia's Family Law System (committee). The key interests of the committee were to ensure the Child Support scheme balances the interests of separated parents, reflects current community standards and, importantly, continues supporting the best interests of children. The committee's report and the Government's response (tabled on 25 January 2023) are available at    <br clear="all">.</br>www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Joint/Family_Law_System.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of the response to the committee's report, the Government agreed to a range of recommendations to improve the Child Support Scheme over the longer term, including the following:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      22.7pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">The Government has established a Child Support Stakeholder Consultation Group who will perform a key advisory role for government on a range of policy and service delivery issues that impact the efficient operation of the Scheme, and positive outcomes for separated parents.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;        margin-left:&#xA;      22.7pt;&#xA;        &#xA;          text-indent:-11.35pt;&#xA;        ">
              <span class="HPS-SmallBullet"> In response to Recommendations 14, 18 and 19 of the Committee's Third Interim Report, the Government has agreed to establish a Child Support Expert Panel, and commission research into the costs of raising children in Australia. The Expert Panel will review the costs of children findings to make recommendations on whether and how to update the Costs of the Children Table (and formula).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government continues to monitor the effect of child support legislation and service delivery. Feedback and recommendations from the community are important to this process.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 1 August 2023 regarding petition number EN5221 requesting free mammogram and ultrasound services for the early detection of breast cancer in woman and men aged 18 to 49 years.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to reducing the impact of breast cancer on all Australians and provides funding and support through the BreastScreen Australia (BreastScreen) program and Medicare.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">BreastScreen aims to reduce morbidity and mortality from breast cancer by actively inviting women in the target age group ofS0-74 years to attend free two-yearly screening mammograms. This is known to be most effective in diagnosing and assessing breast cancer in this age group. This target age range is also consistent with advice from the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Women aged 40-49 years and 75 years and older are also eligible to participate in the BreastScreen program but do not receive an invitation to attend. Further information on the BreastScreen program including is current projects and activities is available on the Department of Health and Aged Care's website www.health.gov.au by using the search term 'BreastScreen Australia'.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Age is the greatest breast cancer risk and younger women are less likely to develop breast cancer. Mammography is less effective at detecting breast cancer in younger women because both breast cancer and dense breast tissue appear as white areas on mammograms. For men, the harms of screening mammograms are currently assessed as outweighing any potential benefits. These risks include undergoing unnecessary procedures, discomfort during screening, and exposure to radiation. As a result, men are not currently targeted in the BreastScreen program.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">According to data from Cancer Australia, male breast cancer accounts for 1% of all breast cancers. The data indicates that an estimated 20,640 Australians. were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2022 (20,428 females and 212 males).

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises breast imaging is an important tool in the investigation of breast changes. In general, services listed on the Medicare Benefits Schedule are for diagnostic purposes and are not for screening purposes. Patient rebates are provided through Medicare for tests such as mammograms, ultrasounds, and imaging guided biopsies for patients of any age and gender with symptoms of breast cancer or a significant family history. Medicare rebates are also available for a small number of specific breast magnetic resonance imaging scans based on clinical evidence. In 2022-23, Medicare expenditure on breast imaging services totalled $198.6 million.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Age Pension</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 11 September 2023 to the Minister for Social Services, the Hon Amanda Rishworth MP, concerning Petition EN5224 relating to the Age Pension age. The Minister has asked me to respond to you on her behalf.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to ensuring the Age Pension is sustainable and future demand can be met. The Government expects to spend around $59 billion on the Age Pension in 2023-24 to assist around 2.6 million eligible Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A person must meet both eligibility and payability criteria in order to receive the Age Pension. To be eligible, a person must be of Age Pension age (67 years) and satisfy the residence requirements. To be payable, a person must also have income and assets below certain limits.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition suggests changing the Age Pension age to 65. When the Age Pension was introduced in 1909, the average male life expectancy at birth was 55. It is now over 80. Consistent with legislation passed in 2009, the Age Pension age gradually increased from 65 years to 67 years between 2017 and 2023. The Government believes that the increase in the Age Pension age to 67 is appropriate. It does not have any plans to increase the Age Pension age any further.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">If a person below Age Pension qualification age requires income support, they may be eligible for an alternative social security payment. For example, they may qualify for payments such as JobSeeker Payment or the Disability Support Pension, subject to eligibility criteria.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">When people reach 60 years of age, they may also become eligible for extra concessions from state and local government authorities through the Seniors Card. Recipients aged 60 or over are able to access their superannuation tax-free if they are paid from a taxed superannuation fund, which is another concession that benefits many seniors.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Minister appreciates you bringing this matter to her attention. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for the notice of a petition referral (petition number EN5235) dated 11 September 2023 regarding increasing the rate of the Disability Support Pension (DSP).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's social security system is designed to provide a safety net for people who, for reasons such as age, disability, caring responsibilities or unemployment, are unable to fully support themselves. The Government is committed to a system that supports the most vulnerable, encourages those who are able to work or study, and is sustainable for future generations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Pensions, including DSP, are paid at the highest legislated rate of income support payments in the social security system. Base pensions are indexed twice a year, in March and September, to the higher of the increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the increase in the Pensioner and Beneficiary Living Cost Index (PBLCI). The CPI and PBLCI measure changes in prices on a range of goods and services such as food, health care, telecommunications, fuel, housing and utilities costs. Base pension rates are also benchmarked to Male Total Average Weekly Earnings (MTAWE) to align them with community living standards.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The last indexation occurred on 20 September 2023. The maximum total pension rate for single pensioners increased by $32.70 to $1,096.70 a fortnight. The maximum rate for pensioner couples increased by $24.70 to $826.70 each a fortnight. Pension rates will continue to be indexed twice a year, as set out in legislation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Pensioners can also receive a range of concessions including, assistance for people who rent in the private rental market through Commonwealth Rent Assistance, subsidised prescription medicines under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, and subsidised health care and related products. State and territory governments and some private providers also offer Pensioner Concession Card holders discounts on other goods and services, such as utility bills.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Services Australia (Centrelink) has social workers who can assist people who are struggling financially. They can provide information or a referral to financial counselling services which are free.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">My department also provides funding to community organisations to deliver free, voluntary and confidential financial counselling services. Under these services, financial counsellors work with people in financial difficulty to address their financial problems, manage debt and make informed choices about their money in the future.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 11 September 2023 regarding petition EN5237 about standards for bus safety.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is working towards the goal of zero deaths and serious injuries on our roads by 2050 (Vision Zero). The impact of road crashes on society is significant. Individuals and families affected by road crashes must deal with pain and suffering, medical costs, lost income, higher insurance premium rates and vehicle repair costs. There is also a personal cost that cannot be measured.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The National Road Safety Strategy 2021-30 (the Strategy), agreed by the federal and all state and territory governments, sets out Australia's road safety objectives over the next decade, and includes key priorities for action and targets to reduce the annual number of fatalities by at least 50 per cent and serious injuries by at least 30 per cent by 2030. The Strategy can be found here at www.roadsafety.gov.au/nrss.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A key priority in the Strategy for the Government is to pursue technological improvements to make new vehicles safer. Considering the scope of the road safety issues, it is important that we prioritise activities according to their potential benefit to the community and the cost of the potential solution.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Although buses are a very safe form of road transport, the government has taken the recent bus tragedies very seriously. Senator the Hon Carol Brown, Assistant Minister for infrastructure and Transport, recently held a roundtable on bus safety which included representatives from the bus industry, bus operators and road safety experts to consider the ongoing safety of buses in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The matters raised there were also considered at the Road Safety Ministers' Meeting on 19 September 2023 and will be progressed to the Infrastructure and Transport Ministers' Meeting later this year to ensure a holistic approach to bus safety across the various government jurisdictions. These discussions include the topic of seatbelts on buses and the wearing of seatbelts more generally.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government already mandates the fitting of seatbelts on buses not designed for standing passengers. The wearing of seatbelts in motor vehicles is a matter for state and territory governments. The Australian Road Rules—model law managed by the National Transport Commission and adopted by states and territories into their laws—require people to wear seatbelts if the vehicle they are travelling in is fitted with them.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The broader issue of enforcing seatbelt wearing is more challenging. The Road Trauma Australia 2022 Statistical Summary, published by the Bureau of Infrastructure and Transport Research Economics in the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts, shows that over the last IO years at least 20% of people killed in motor vehicles weren't wearing seatbelts. Assistant Minister Brown and I will continue to work with our colleagues in the states and territories to address these important issues.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for taking the time to write to me on this matter.</span>

              <span class="HPS-SubDebate">Pensions and Benefits</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 11 September 2023 to the Minister for Social Services, the Hon Amanda Rishworth MP, concerning petition (EN5251) that refers to income support being received by immigrants. The Minister has asked me to respond to you on her behalf.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian social security system is a taxpayer-funded, non-contributory system based on the concepts of residence and need, which provides a strong safety net for Australians who are unable to fully support themselves due to age, disability, caring responsibilities or unemployment. This is achieved via a design that features targeted assistance that is needs-based, with income and assets tests operating so that those most in need receive greater assistance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Income support payments including JobSeeker Payment are designed to support people in Australia who are unable to support themselves whilst they look for a job or have a temporary injury or incapacity. JobSeeker Payment recipients are encouraged and supported to find suitable work. The structure of the income test and the tapering of payment rates are designed to ensure that recipients who find work will be better off, rather than relying solely on income support.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government believes that every person should have the opportunity to find suitable employment and experience the benefits of being in a job, rather than relying on income support. People who depend on income support for long periods rather than paid work face increased risks of financial hardship and exclusion from the workforce.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Social security payments operate in conjunction with the tax system, employment services, and other labour market strategies as part of an integrated package to support workforce participation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Generally, most recipients of unemployment payments are required to meet mutual obligation requirements. Mutual obligations policy is carefully considered by the Government and helps people connect to employment and become job ready through engaging with employment services, undertaking job search and participating in other activities. There is strong international and Australian evidence that mutual obligation requirements speed individuals' entry into employment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under current arrangements, job seekers may be subject to payment suspensions or penalties if they do not meet mutual obligation requirements, without a valid reason. As part of this, job seekers are obligated to participate in appointments with their employment service provider, agree to a Job Plan, search for jobs and attend activities according to their capacity to support them in taking advantage of employment opportunities as they arise.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, if a job seeker refuses an offer of suitable employment without a valid reason, they may have their payment cancelled, and may have to wait for four weeks before they can reapply for income support.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Most people are honest and use Government services fairly. However, if a person believes someone may not be legitimately receiving payments, they can provide that information to the Australian Government Fraud Tip-off Line on 13 15 24. Alternatively, they can provide details online at servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/contact-us/reporting-fraud.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A key policy principle is that recipients of Government payments generally, do not pay tax unless they receive other income in addition to their payments. While JobSeeker Payment is taxable, a recipient is entitled to the beneficiary tax offset (BTO) under the tax system. The BTO ensures that recipients of certain taxable payments will not be subject to income tax if they have no other taxable income. Where a person has other taxable income, they may still be eligible for a partial offset. More information on the BTO is available at www.ato.gov.au, by searching for beneficiary tax offset.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information is of assistance. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The words and tune of the Australian National Anthem were proclaimed by the Governor-General of Australia on 19 April 1984, after extensive surveys of national opinion, starting in the 1970s. On 1 January 2021, the second line of the Anthem changed from '<span style="font-style:italic;">For we are young and free' </span>to '<span style="font-style:italic;">For we are one and free</span>'. This change was made to represent all Australians.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Anthem remains widely accepted by Australians and identifies our Nation at home and overseas. This does not mean we cannot enjoy other songs about Australia such as 'I am Australian'.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">While the Government has no plans to change this important national symbol at this time, discourse around these matters in the wider community should be celebrated and encouraged as an important part of our democracy.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 11 September 2023 regarding Petition EN53l3, which requests legislation regarding media publication of motor vehicle accidents.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The signatories of this petition have expressed concern about journalists and news media outlets which publish details and/or photographs of fatal motor vehicle accidents without familial or next of kin consent. Their petition requests legislation that prohibits publication of such content without family consent to do so. I acknowledge the sensitivities regarding the content of the petition and am deeply sorry to hear about the issue.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises that a balanced and independent media sector plays an important role in the functioning of Australian society. Australia's media sector is primarily regulated by the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (BSA), which contains rules regarding media ownership and control in Australia. Regulation is focussed on the diversity of media ownership and aims to promote a strong media sector capable of producing trusted public interest journalism.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In contrast, regulation of content must be carefully balanced with the freedom of the press. The importance of a free media is recognised through an emphasis on industry playing a lead role in the development and administration of content standards that reflect community expectations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Most content broadcast in Australia is regulated by co-regulatory codes of practice developed by broadcasting peak industry bodies, in consultation with the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), in accordance with the BSA. Codes of practice are available on the ACMA's website at acma.gov.au/industry-codes-practice.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's print news media operates under a self-regulatory framework in which the Australian Press Council (APC) assesses complaints for most industry participants. The APC publishes a statement of principles which are binding on all publications subject to its jurisdiction. The principles include privacy and avoidance of harm, whereby journalistic content should uphold personal privacy and avoid causing or contributing to substantial distress. The principles are available at: presscouncil.org.au/standards/statement-of-principles.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I encourage the signatories of this petition to notify the APC, the ACMA, and other relevant industry bodies, such as the Independent Media Council, of their concerns.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter regarding petition EN5348. The petition asks that Members maintain a greater physical presence in the Chamber while the House is sitting.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As Speaker of the House, I administer the standing orders that are the rules of the House. There is no requirement in the standing orders that Members attend the Chamber at all times.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Because of the demands placed on Members generally, and Ministers and office holders in particular, it is necessary that they spend a great proportion of their time on public duties outside of the Chamber when they attend Parliament House for sittings. For example, a Member may take part in parliamentary proceedings in the Federation Chamber, and is typically a member of several parliamentary committees, all of which meet during sitting weeks.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Members may acquaint themselves with all speeches on a matter considered in the House by following proceedings from their offices via the televising of speeches made in the House of Representatives and the Federation Chamber. They can also consult the Hansard record of all parliamentary proceedings. That they do so is evident in their contributions.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Services Australia (the Agency) has not identified the requirement for a service centre in the Benalla community due to the proximity of Wangaratta Service Centre and an agent service in Benalla that provides reliable and consistent access to Centrelink, Medicare and Child Support services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Benalla Agent staff work closely with the staff at the Wangaratta Service Centre to coordinate additional and specialised support for vulnerable customers where required. Opportunities are routinely reviewed and being explored in order to support vulnerable customers in the Benalla community to access government services. This has enabled seamless referrals for vulnerable customers attending the Benalla Agent. Benalla residents continue to have access to the Wangaratta Service Centre at 25 Faithfull Street, Wangaratta where they can choose to book an appointment at a time suitable to them. These appointments can also be completed by telephone, reducing the need to travel to Wangaratta Service Centre and wait for assistance.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Agents are provided with extensive training to ensure they can support customers conduct their business with the Agency. Agents offer access to services such as phones, printing and internet enabled computers, and help customers register for and use digital self-serve channels, including myGov. Free Wi-Fi is available for community members to complete their government business online. The Agent service can also connect local residents with more complex enquiries directly to an Agency staff member via a dedicated phone line.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Local specialised servicing has been strengthened. The Agency's Mobile Service Centre visits Benalla annually, with a visit in November 2022 and July 2023. Agency specialist officers engage directly with vulnerable customers in Benalla through outreach and out-servicing with local community organisations. A Specialist fortnightly visiting arrangement with Waminda Community House commenced from 5 July 2022. The Agency has also hosted two digital learning events in Benalla. These events provide the Agency the opportunity to talk to the community about self- managed services, build digital engagement, and promote the Agent Service. Community feedback from these events has been positive.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Agency regularly reviews the composition of our service delivery footprint including Agents and Access Points to ensure that we have a sustainable, accessible and fit for purpose service delivery network. Across Australia there has been a significant change in the way that people choose to undertake their business with the Agency due to transformation and modernisation of business and information technology, as well as the increased uptake of digital services such as myGov and the Express Plus mobile apps.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your correspondence of 07 August 2023 to the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon Andrew Giles MP, enclosing Petition PN0566, with 55 signatures, calling to end all indefinite offshore and onshore detention of refugees and asylum seekers, to resolve their visa processing within a 90 day time limit and to release all refugees and asylum seekers into the community if this request is not met. Your correspondence has been referred to me as the matter falls within my portfolio responsibilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is a cohesive, multicultural society of people drawn from a rich variety of cultural backgrounds. The Australian Government knows the important social and economic contribution migrants and refugees have had through our nation's history. The Government is committed to delivering orderly and legal pathways to Australia through robust migration and humanitarian programs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While a humane approach to irregular migration is required, we must also ensure that new people smuggling ventures do not reach our shores. As such, the Government has committed to maintaining strong border protection measures, including regional processing. Under this approach, people who attempt to travel to Australia irregularly by boat will not be settled in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is party to the various international human rights treaties, including 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Australia takes its international obligations seriously and is committed to upholding them.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Transitory persons in an existing regional processing country are not detained and are living and working in the community. A transitory person, defined by section 5 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Migration Act 1958 </span>(the Act), refers to an 'unauthorised maritime arrival' who has been transferred to a regional processing country. They have ongoing access to health and welfare services, including mental health, delivered by a multi-disciplinary team of health practitioners, including general practitioners, nurses and counselling specialists. Specialist health services include psychology, psychiatry, dentistry, obstetrics, radiography and pharmaceutical services are also available. Where clinically indicated specialist medical treatment is not available, mechanisms are in place for temporary transfer to a third country for assessment and treatment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I assure you the Government is committed to finding durable migration outcomes for individuals under regional processing and we continue to support the implementation of third country resettlement arrangements with the United States and New Zealand.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is also aware of transitory persons exploring private sponsorship in Canada and is providing logistical interview and travel assistance to Canada to progress these cases. While I acknowledge the urgency from individuals and their families for a resettlement migration outcome to happen fast, we must also recognize that third country resettlement option takes time. Individuals are strongly encouraged to engage with available migration options. Third country resettlement provides the best available opportunity for individuals to build a path to a new life.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">With respect to onshore detention, the Government maintains detention in an immigration detention facility as an option of last resort for the management of unlawful non-citizens and should occur for the shortest time practicable.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Immigration detention of an unlawful non-citizen is not arbitrary and may be necessary for resolving individuals' status. Under the Act, detention is not limited by a set timeframe, it ends when an unlawful non-citizen is either granted a visa or is removed from Australia. Australia's immigration status resolution practices ensure that any person who is detained understands the reason for their detention and the options available to them, including choosing to return to their country of origin or pursuing legal remedies.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="181810" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech" style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">Ms </span>
                  </a>
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech" style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">TEMPLEMAN</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate" style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:01</span>):  One of the petitions presented today has raised concerns around e-petitions and the signature collection process. Petition number EN5444 is published on the House e-petitions website and requests that the House prevent wind turbines being built off the Illawarra coastline. The petition received 11,291 signatures. From the outset, I'd like to say that the vast majority of these petitioners signed the petition in good faith. Unfortunately, the committee is aware that a small number of these signatures on the petition may have been collected through unethical means. We consider this to be a serious risk to the integrity of the petitions system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me explain. It was brought to the committee's attention that a recent <span style="font-style:italic;">Illawarra </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Mercury </span>newspaper article reported that an individual on social media was offering beautician service giveaways for signing the petition. Screenshots were supplied to the committee. As a consequence, the committee requested analysis of the petition's signatures be done by the secretariat. That showed duplication of nearly 200 names, up to 1.7 per cent of signatories, meaning they appear to have signed the petition more than once using the same name but different email accounts. It is not possible to verify if people signed the petition using different names as well as different email accounts. The committee also wrote to the principal petitioner, who has told us that he was unaware of the inducements being offered until he read our letter, that he had not seen the media coverage in the newspaper, and that the offer of prizes or gifts if people signed the petition had been quickly removed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee would like to place on the record that offering any kind of incentive for signing a petition to the House of Representatives undermines the democratic process of petitioning, and the committee condemns such behaviour in the strongest terms. In order to spell out clearly the requirement that people sign petitions only once, the committee made changes to the signatory process. All signatories will now be required to check a box confirming that they have only signed the petition once. While it has been implied that a person may only sign a petition once, it is now explicitly spelt out. Signing a petition multiple times compromises the integrity of the petitions system by both increasing the number of signatories and misrepresenting the level of public support for a petition. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee accepts that principal petitioners cannot be responsible for the actions of every person in connection with their petition over the signature-collection period. However, we encourage principal petitioners, as campaign organisers and leaders, to play an active role in promoting ethical behaviour in relation to their petition to the parliament, particularly for larger and more politically charged petitions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The current e-petitions system is designed to be secure while also being open and accessible. When signing a petition, a person provides their name and email address. An email is then sent to that email address, and the person must click on the link provided in the email to confirm their signature. The petition will only accept one signature from each unique email address. However, the system does not prevent a person from signing more than once using different email accounts. We believe that the multiple signing of petitions is rare. However, the committee will be monitoring this matter closely.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has approached the issues I raise today as an opportunity to improve the House e-petitions system, introduced in 2016. We believe that the majority of people who engage with the House petitions process do so in good faith and in accordance with the rules.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the House.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="299145" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BYRNES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:05</span>):  I rise to take note of the Petitions Committee report and the contribution that has just been made by the committee chair. I would like to associate myself with the comments that the chair has just made and for her leadership in dealing with the matter which she has summarised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Petitioning has been described as the oldest of all parliamentary forms, and is the only direct means by which an individual or group can ask the parliament to take action. I, like many in this place, am of the view that the House of Representatives should provide an open and accessible petitioning process that allows people to readily exercise their right to petition. As a member of the Petitions Committee, charged with overseeing this process, as a parliamentarian and as a member of the Illawarra community, I was shocked when I read in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Illawarra Mercury</span> that individuals were seeking to undermine the legitimacy of the petitions process in this place and the genuine concerns and questions from my community. As the chair has outlined, the committee is aware that a small number of signatures on petition EN5444 may have been collected through unethical means—namely, by seeking to offer prizes and inducements to petition this parliament against the proposed Illawarra offshore wind zone, which the government currently has out for community consultation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many parts of this situation which I find concerning, including the serious risk to the integrity of the petition system that this action poses. What I find most concerning is that this approach was not made in error or from a lack of knowledge about the petitions process, but done with the full intention to distort the scale of this particular petition. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Illawarra Mercury</span> article by Connor Pearce on 10 October states:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Her post acknowledged the unethical nature of the competition. "I realise this is blackmail I don't care at this stage," she said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">When contacted by the Mercury, the woman said the inducements were "not really blackmail" but were driven by her response to the offshore wind farm proposal. "I offered discounted services for people to vote," she said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the chair has pointed out, and as the Minister for Climate Change and Energy has said publicly, there is evidence and further allegations of people sending multiple responses under fake email addresses or aliases to subvert the legitimacy both of this petition and the community consultation process, which the minister is undertaking on the proposed offshore wind zone. One such allegation has been provided to me in the form of a statutory declaration from a constituent, Martin Cubby. Mr Cubby put to me that at a community meeting on 28 September this year, members of the Coalition against Offshore Wind, 'Encouraged community members to submit multiple submissions to the REZ through the federal government website using alternative or fake email addresses.' I would put to this chamber that the actions we saw taken on petition EN5444 are not an isolated incident but a coordinated effort to undermine and inflate representations of community options to this parliament and to the government. I would like to thank the secretariat for their work in investigating this matter and note that the committee has agreed to look further into the security of petitions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed offshore wind zone in the Illawarra has raised a lot of questions and concerns, and these are justified. There is a lot to learn and consider with renewable energy generation for Australia. I have been listening to my community's questions and concerns, relaying them to the minister and seeking to provide the community with accurate and reliable information. However, just like the secretariat, my office has been waylaid in having to sort through the countless fake emails, fake profiles and pseudonyms. This is a coordinated action by a select few whose clear intention is to hinder and hamper my ability to engage and answer questions from genuine members of the community. I do acknowledge that a great majority of people who engage with the House petitions process do so in good faith and in accordance with the rules.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lobbying activities are communications with government representatives to influence government decision-making. We know that, in a democracy, the right of bodies to make representations to government, to have access to and an impact on policymaking, is fundamental to the proper conduct of public life and to the development of sound policy. However, lobbying leads to corruption if it prompts decision-making which is not merit based, honest and transparent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The existing federal Lobbying Code of Conduct is an administrative instrument aimed at ensuring the conduct between lobbyists and government representatives is conducted in accordance with public expectations of transparency, integrity and honesty. However, that code is toothless, and it has failed. It is too limited. It does not engender transparency. And it is not enforced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Commercial lobbying is a multibillion dollar industry in Australia. The current public Register of Lobbyists applies only to third-party lobbyists—paid professionals engaged by clients to influence public officials on their behalf. It does not include in-house lobbyists—those employed within an entity purely to undertake that role. So it applies only to 20 per cent of the lobbyists roaming our corridors, knocking on our doors, seeking to influence our decisions. The other 80 per cent—who knows?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The register as it stands does not include company executives, NGOs, not-for-profits, charities, think tanks, research centres, religious organisations or trade unions. On 5 November 2023, the register included 703 third-party lobbyists. Forty per cent of those were former politicians, ministerial advisers and senior public servants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are three main reasons for regulating lobbying. The first is to prevent corrupt behaviour by lobbyists and public officials—cash for access, cash for comment and cash for approvals. The second is to ensure fairness in decision-making by stopping secret lobbying by vested interests. The third is to ensure that government decisions are merit based.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Enforcement of lobbying codes in this country has been dismal. In 2018, the Auditor-General found that the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet hadn't suspended registration of a single lobbyist since 2013—this despite at least 11 possible breaches of the code of conduct during that period. The current code meets only one of the 10 Principles for Transparency and Integrity in Lobbying set down by the global Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Suggestions that the code be better enforced have been actively rebuffed by successive governments. We need an independent regulator administering a strong legislative scheme, not a complacent and conflicted government waving an administrative framework with the cohesion and effectiveness of a wet tissue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill I'm presenting today was developed with the generous support of a number of transparency organisations—bodies that will be overjoyed to enter upon the new federal lobbying register. We're already behind the United Kingdom, Canada and the US. They have legislated strong integrity frameworks, the power of which includes their scope: postemployment restrictions, penalties, independence of the administrative entity and transparency both of monitoring and of public reporting. All of those things are addressed in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill includes provision for a new, publicly accessible online lobbyist register which will include in-house as well as third-party lobbyists. Lobbyists will be required to lodge online quarterly returns reporting who they've met with, for how long, where and why. Ministers will publish their diaries, too, so that we can cross-compare and verify that reporting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill maintains a longer postemployment prohibition such that ministers and senior staff are banned from working as lobbyists for three years after they leave parliament. It legislates a register of senior government appointments so that we know who is working where and when during and after their time in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It regulates enforceability. There will be fines and bans for lobbyists who are in breach of the bill. Rather than a self-regulated code bedevilled by intrinsic and systemic conflict of interest, the code will be independently enforced by our independent integrity commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We want and we need to hold public officials to a higher standard of integrity. When they leave public office, officials shouldn't be able to use insider knowledge for personal gain or the commercial benefit of their new employer, and they shouldn't be making decisions prior to leaving office which might advance their employer-to-be. We have seen time and time again in this place the revolving door, the golden escalator, between this house and industry, with ministers and public servants accepting lucrative private sector jobs with unseemly haste immediately upon leaving parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A code of conduct which allows our defence minister to discuss defence business with a global contracting firm in cabinet and then take a job with that firm nine days after leaving politics is a code which is corrosive of public trust in democracy. A code which allows our foreign minister to award more than $500 million in contracts to a private organisation and then accept a job with that contractor less than 12 months after leaving politics is corrosive of public trust in democracy. A code which then allows the Prime Minister discretion over its own enforcement is corrosive of public trust in democracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sunlight is the best medicine, and it's time to shine a light into the halls of this place to illuminate the workings of the light on the hill. We need to know who has the ears of our politicians and we need to close and stop that revolving door. Australians deserve to be able to trust their government. They want this bill debated by their representatives and they want this law passed by this government.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:18</span>):  I second the motion. I'm pleased to support the Lobbying (Improving Government Honesty and Trust) Bill 2023. I'm proud to stand with a group of crossbench parliamentarians who are fighting so hard to reflect the wishes of their communities to strive for better transparency, greater integrity and more accountability in politics. Part of accountability and integrity is understanding who is influencing our top decision-makers. We should know which lobbyists have access to ministers and cabinet. Currently, Australia lags behind our counterparts in Canada, the UK and even the US in the transparency and accountability of lobbying activity. In each of those countries there's a legislated lobbying regime with clear reporting obligations arising from lobbying activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, in Australia's federal parliament, we only have an administrative system, governed by the Lobbying Code of Conduct and overseen by the Attorney-General's Department. There are no meaningful consequences for breaching the federal code of conduct. The code of conduct applies only to professional lobbyists acting on behalf of third-party clients. That means lobbying activity that's undertaken in-house by businesses and industry bodies isn't included. In-house lobbyists are able to conduct invisible activity without regulation or oversight.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's comparatively weak regulation heightens the concern expressed by the Grattan Institute. It says, 'Disparity in access is a concern if it translates into policy decisions that benefit the few at the expense of the many.' Grattan Institute's analysis showed that highly regulated businesses have the most meetings with senior politicians, make the most use of commercial lobbyists and are disproportionately large donors.</span>

This bill delivers those contemplated reforms. It requires the publication of ministerial diaries and requires both professional and in-house lobbyists to tell us who they're meeting with. By substantially limiting gifts and hospitality from lobbyists this bill also continues the work of my restoring trust bill in reducing financial influence.</span>

We've seen a steady decline over 20 years in voter satisfaction with democracy, trust in government and political efficacy. Liberal democracies around the world face significant challenges as lies in political advertising have become more shameless and their delivery more sophisticated. We saw this in the referendum debate but we've seen scare campaigns before from both sides of politics, such as those involving Medicare and death taxes.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Until now, we've been willing to mandate strong protections for consumers against lies and deception in business but not in political communications. Voters deserve protection from lies in politics, too. Banning lies in political ads has broad support. An exit poll on referendum day shows an overwhelming majority of Australians support truth in political advertising laws, regardless of their referendum vote or their political affiliation. Voters don't want to be lied to. It's obvious.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australia Institute said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">… voters should go to the polls armed with the facts. It is perfectly legal to lie in a political ad &amp; it shouldn't be.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Stopping lies in political communications was supported by the ALP in its submission to the JSCEM inquiry, the Australian Greens and many on the crossbench. So, who is against this? Who is openly arguing against the idea of banning lies? Advance Australia is currently running a scare campaign claiming the regulation of lies and political advertising will 'hit solid citizens with unfair criminal convictions'. They say, ' Faceless bureaucrats and big tech will decide what's true and what isn't'. This position is backed by the Liberals and Nationals who are increasingly occupying the space at the Trumpy end of the political spectrum. But making findings of fact is not a new concept; our judicial system does it every day. Giving up on the ability to make determinations of fact would seriously erode trust in our system of government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We must balance freedom of speech against a democratic right to be informed by focusing our regulation on purported statements of fact rather than opinions or ideas in contested areas. The best response to the objection that it's all too hard is that this has been operating successfully in South Australia since 1985. It makes politicians think twice about what they say. The government now has a choice: progress reforms like this with the support of the crossbench or accept Advance Australia's premise, backed by the opposition, that protecting the right to tell lies is more important than protecting Australian voters and their democratic right to be informed. I will continue to work constructively in the interests of protecting and improving our democracy through reforms like this one.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Airservices Australia's last annual report showed more complaints for Brisbane Airport than all other major Australian airports combined. Since the opening of the new parallel runway, I've heard from many constituents that flight noise is acutely impacting the community, especially when they're trying to sleep. Former Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said: 'Aircraft noise is a major problem for many people in Brisbane's suburbs. There are increasing numbers of night flights disturbing people's sleep. I believe the only solution is the introduction of a night curfew. Everybody has a right to a decent night's sleep.' Health data clearly illustrates that flight noise has a direct effect on wellbeing and is linked to lower quality of life, poorer wellbeing and psychological ill health. This needs to be fixed. The residents of Brisbane should have the same rights as other Australians—the right to a good night's sleep.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Brisbane Airport Corporation's ambition is to double flights over the city by 2035. The government's own aviation green paper predicts a tripling of flight movements by 2050. This stands to significantly increase noise, CO2 emissions and air pollution. This is not an issue that is just going to go away. Last week, the Greens secured a big concession from the federal government, which could see hundreds more flights taking off and landing over the water rather than the homes of Brisbane residents. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of Greens and community pressure, the transport minister agreed to direct Airservices Australia to operate both runways at Brisbane Airport over the water at once, when safe to do so, subject to approval from the airspace advisory board. This mode is called 'SODPROPS mode', or simultaneous opposite direction parallel runway operations. SODPROPS mode is not always possible, particularly when weather conditions make it unsafe. However, this commitment secured as a result of Greens and community pressure will mean the government must report clearly to the community on the share of flights going over the water. On occasions where SODPROPS can't be used, the government must report on the reasons why, allowing the Brisbane community to hold the airport and Airservices Australia to account for these decisions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once implemented, this concession could see the biggest reduction in flight noise since the opening of the second runway. These kinds of results are only possible because residents in the community have been making their voices heard. I want to say thank you to everyone who has letterboxed, shared petitions, come to rallies, sent emails and helped build this movement. We remain committed to this cause, and we won't rest until we've won lasting protections. We will continue to campaign for a cap and a curfew. By introducing reasonable restrictions, such as implementing a night-time curfew on flights from 10 pm to 6 am, we can sustainably reduce aircraft noise across Brisbane. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Noise reduction mechanisms like this are already in place and providing relief for other communities near airports across Australia, including Sydney Airport, which has had both a cap and a curfew since 1997. Despite recent attacks against communities by the Queensland Deputy Premier, this is not a nimby attitude. In fact, when introducing his private member's bill to tackle flight noise in Sydney, it was the current Prime Minister that said, 'I am tired of those who say this this debate is about inner-city people wanting to dump their problems somewhere else.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The east coast corridor contains three of the busiest air routes in the world. Instead of tripling flight movements by 2050, we should look to decarbonise our travel and finally build high-speed rail in this country. But, since the sell-off of our major airports and national carrier in the nineties, we've now created an extremely powerful corporate lobby group that has fought to prevent noise protections and fought against high-speed rail in order to maintain their profits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, this fight is led by the community, by people speaking up against the greed of big corporations and speaking up against the major parties that sit in the back pocket of airline corporations. The community is tired of playing by rules for the airports designed by the airports. The Greens will always stand for the community in that fight against big corporations.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:37</span>):  I rise to speak on the motion brought by the member for Brisbane. In doing so, I want to acknowledge that every member of this House advocates for their constituents, and I have no doubt that the member is attempting to do this for his constituents. While decrying the fact that it's not inner-city people advocating for something, I'd point out that there are two inner-city MPs with petitions that would put more planes over my electorate—in fact, over my own house.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know aircraft noise is an issue for many greater Brisbane residents. I used to live in Tarragindi under the flight path of the old runway, and I now live in Moorooka under the new runway flight path. When I look up from my house I see planes flying directly overhead. I also get Archerfield planes doing touch-and-go circuits, as well as emergency CareFlight helicopters and police returning to their base at Archerfield. So aircraft noise is not a theoretical concept used to clickbait and data harvest for me: it is personal. But, as leaders and lawmakers, we're here with a responsibility to the nation to put aside the temptation to score cheap political victories and to consider the broader impacts of our actions on all those they would affect. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A curfew at Brisbane Airport threatens to kill Brisbane's only Qatar Airways service as well as impact international carriers such as Singapore, Emirates, Fiji Airways, Cathay Pacific, EVA, China Airlines, VietJet, Jetstar and Qantas. Domestically, regional Queensland will be the most impacted, with a reduction of 3,100 flights. On the ground, this means that families and loved ones who live in regional Queensland—and remember, we are the most decentralised state—will not be able to visit as often or as easily or, in some circumstances, at all. In fact, many of the overnight cargo flights that leave Brisbane Airport are headed to regional Queensland, and they're carrying things like fresh produce or mechanical parts for farming equipment. They carry critical medical and pharmaceutical supplies, including cancer medications for some of the most remote communities in Queensland. So this Greens bill would make Queensland the only state where next-day delivery of time-sensitive items cannot be guaranteed. Are we really prepared to tell some Australians, particularly Queenslanders, that an inconvenience visited on some Brisbane residents affected by aircraft noise—and, as I said, I live right underneath this pathway—will outweigh their need for life-saving medical products?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At a time when Australians' demand for air services is high—and I'm sure that the member for Brisbane didn't come here by train or drive down—the simple fact remains that less capacity will cause a surge in fare prices and make air travel less affordable, not just for Brisbane residents but for people in regional Queensland and northern New South Wales, and travellers from interstate and beyond. Currently, 75 per cent of all Queensland tourism arrivals come through Brisbane Airport. As an island nation, geographically removed from much of the rest of the world, we're already at a disadvantage when it comes to attracting international travellers, and a curfew would only disadvantage us further.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not just about Brisbane residents experiencing the impacts of aircraft noise. The bill affects cafe and restaurant owners. It affects bar workers, tourism workers, airport workers, the member for Brisbane's former retail colleagues and many, many more. In fact, job losses of some 30,000 by 2032 across the aviation, tourism, logistics and resource sectors could be expected if a curfew were to be implemented. And, obviously, 2032 is the year of the Olympics. It would be a strange statement to the rest of the world. For context, 30,000 jobs is more job losses than there are currently employees at Brisbane airport. Economic losses to the tune of $2.82 billion could also be expected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just passenger fares that would increase. It's also the cost of imported goods—online purchases that everyday Queenslanders make of goods which come in from overseas. It's also everyday household items that would increase in price.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I do genuinely sympathise with those who experience aircraft noise. I meet with them regularly. I have representatives on the Brisbane airport committee and the committee convened by Minister King.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, during a cost-of-living crisis, it is extremely difficult to justify any action that would put further strain on the hardworking constituents that I represent by saying that airline prices must go up. We are talking about people: particularly low- to middle-income earners, renters and students—many people that I'm sure the member for Brisbane does care about. We need to get the balance right. But, if you want a place where there are no aircraft, you shouldn't be living in the middle of Brisbane.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M3C" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:42</span>):  Many members of the public who aren't affected by aircraft noise may think it's an issue that affects only people who live near airports—and many of them it affects greatly. But what I want to tell the House is that, in Melbourne, and in east Melbourne in particular, it's currently Rafferty's rules in the skies above east Melbourne, and aircraft noise is a very, very real problem for people who live there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you think about east Melbourne, for those who don't know, it's an area that's right next to the MCG. One of the things that this means is that there are, routinely, helicopters that come in and fly in a loop around the MCG to have a look at it and to film what's going on. But it's not just helicopters who come in and loop the loop around the MCG, keeping a distance, so they can get a view inside, which of course puts them right over people's houses at a very low height; it's also small fixed-wing aircraft that come in, for tourist reasons, so that people can have a look at the MCG or at Melbourne, and fly in circles around the MCG, keeping a bit of distance from the centre and flying right over people's houses. But it is also aircraft that take off from Moorabbin and Essendon who come in and do a loop around the city, because the MCG is a recognised landmark, and then fly back, perhaps to clock up their training hours or perhaps for some other reasons. That adds to it as well. So, when you look at a map of flights over east Melbourne, it's a whirlpool centred around the MCG. It's a twisted tangle of spaghetti, of flights flying over and over—in a completely unregulated manner, as far as the impact on the residents is concerned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To add to that, a change was made several years ago for large aircraft. That was savaged by the Aircraft Noise Ombudsman for failing to consult the residents. Flight paths and gathering points for large aircraft now are basically broadly over IKEA in Richmond. The aircraft line up one after the other to come in over the city before turning north and heading to Melbourne Airport.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you add all those things together and the fact that governments over the years have completely ignored regulation of our skies when it comes to residents who don't live near an airport but are affected by flight paths then you have for many people in East Melbourne an almost unbearable situation on some days. Residents have told me of their windows shaking, the noise that means they can't go outside into their backyard and the effect it is having on people's mental health. Some people have said to me, 'It's like it disrupts your ability to just live a normal life.' This is not what people sign up for. At the moment it is completely unregulated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people who live there have pushed and pushed against some very powerful interests, who say, 'We're not going to do anything about it because it is more important for people to be able to fly wherever they want than for people to have a good night's sleep or to enjoy life in their homes.' They have pushed and pushed. As a result of that community pressure, with the Greens working side by side, we've secured something very significant from the minister. I thank the minister for her action on this. There will now be a taskforce aimed at better understanding the issue and determining operating procedures that will better protect residents from overflight. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There will be a very big difference if some changes to flight paths are made—not changes that push the problem onto other people but changes, for example, that could result in leisure flights flying down the river or over the rail yards instead of over the people's houses, so everyone can still get a good look at Melbourne but not have an impact on residents. Changes to flight paths could see flights come in and turn at a different point that's not over people's houses, so again you don't push the problem onto other people but ensure that resident amenity is protected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge Greg Bisinella, Shelley Faubel, Matt Faubel, Ian Mitchell, Susan Henderson, David Woodward, Jennifer Owen and everyone else in the East Melbourne Group and all the other people in East Melbourne who have not taken no for an answer and have pushed and pushed. We are starting to see progress. Now we need to see action.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300122" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hawke</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:47</span>):  Australia needs a healthy and productive aviation sector to support our economy and the many jobs across the many industries that rely on it. The vastness of Australia inevitably means we rely heavily on aviation for our internal movements as well as to maintain our connections to the outside world. My community has a long history in aviation. It started in Diggers Rest, with one of the first flights to take off in this country, and now the Melbourne Airport precinct provides my community with many jobs and employment opportunities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Directly adjacent to the Melbourne Airport is my electorate of Hawke. People in Sunbury, Bulla and the surrounding areas know all too well the impact our aviation sector has on communities. Now more than ever we need to support workers in the aviation sector and its supporting industries because it brings opportunities and jobs that sustain places like my community. These jobs flow on to sustain the local economies in the suburbs and towns nearby. Some 18,000 people are directly employed across the Melbourne Airport precinct, and it supports a further 146,000 jobs across the community, from cafes, eateries and retail spots to the administration staff and the proud road transport workers who connect our airport to the rest of the country, its community and its economy. The freight task alone is 205 million tonnes, worth $222 billion, around 30 per cent of all of Australia's airfreight. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The airport is an economic lifeblood of our community, so it requires appropriate oversight from government to ensure that we get the best outcomes. We know what happens when governments abandon these communities. When they don't back in workers, it puts them at risk of being left behind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen this in recent years, such as when the former Liberal government watched on while Qantas illegally sacked 1,700 workers in the middle of a pandemic. That was 1,700 families put through hell while all the time the Liberals were handing out $2 billion in taxpayer funded handouts to the very same company. It's no surprise that many workers, including many in my electorate, took Qantas all the way to the High Court, supported by the mighty Transport Workers Union, and won. The Liberals have consistently shown their colours when it comes to the treatment of workers in this sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to noise, the Albanese government understand the concerns raised about airport developments across the country. Just as we understand the noise impacting Brisbane, we know it impacts communities everywhere. When it comes to the proposed third runway for Melbourne Airport, we're work with the community, the operators and the airport to look at the best solutions to minimise the impact of flights on communities under flight paths. This will mean that greater consideration will be given when these decisions are made to addressing the concerns raised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This work forms a broader picture in this space. The Albanese government is working to provide clarity and forward thinking for the future of the industry. The aviation white paper will set the long-term policies that will guide us through the next phase of rapidly increasing growth and innovation in the aviation sector so that everyone in our community and across our economy can enjoy the jobs that that brings. It will allow the government's vision for policies on safety, competitiveness, sustainability and efficiency to ensure that the sector is best positioned to continue delivering aviation services for the Australian public all while looking forward to 2050 and the challenges that that will bring.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the key issues that it will address is enhancing the mechanisms for consultation and management of issues such as aircraft noise and the redevelopment of airports across the country. This will go a long way towards ensuring communities just like mine get the best possible outcomes in terms of both jobs and minimisation of aircraft noise. It's what responsible governments do—consult widely and work closely with the community to deliver on the promises and reforms that will leave a lasting legacy. We know how important the aviation sector is to our economy, to jobs and to staying connected, and that's why it's so important that we get it right.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The community I represent is a mosaic of cultures, backgrounds and stories. It's a community that reflects what makes Australia great. It's full of diversity and displays a distinct Australian multiculturalism. Every street in my electorate has benefited from the contributions of migrants who chose Bennelong and Australia as their home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this dynamic and multicultural community, our nation's migration system reverberates far beyond the discussions in this chamber and the words written in legislation and regulation. Our migration system changes lives. It impacts our neighbours, our friends and our family members. Sixty-six per cent of my electorate had one or both parents born overseas. Migration matters to modern Australia, and we know that a broken migration system impacts upon electorates like mine the most.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The revelations uncovered by the Nixon review into migration are as confronting as they are infuriating. Our migration system should never operate like it did ever again. The Rapid Review into the Exploitation of Australia's Visa System paints a stark picture of a broken immigration system, a system that was left to rot by the Leader of the Opposition in his former role as Minister for Home Affairs. The review revealed a deeply flawed system that allowed criminal gangs from around the world to exploit vulnerabilities in the system for their benefit and, tragically, at the expense of genuine migrants who would have otherwise reunited with their families or filled much-needed skills shortages. When Labor came to government, there were nearly one million visas waiting to be processed. The department had been deliberately neglected, understaffed and ignored. Nearly one million visitors, students and skilled workers were left in limbo waiting for the word that they'll be reunited with their families. Families left apart, businesses short of skilled workers, humanitarian visas piling up—this was a byproduct of the neglect of the Leader of the Opposition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under his administration, the system wasn't geared for the people; instead, it was geared for criminals. As the report identified, criminals exposed grotesque abuses of our migration system. Grotesque. The gravity of this situation cannot be overstated. We had a system that allowed rings of women to be caught in sexual slavery within our own country, a system that essentially designated migrant worker exploitation as a feature rather than a flaw and a system that turned a blind eye to the systemic breakdown of immigration compliance and genuine visa processing. All of this occurred under the Leader of the Opposition's watch when he was then Minister for Home Affairs. The member for Dickson stood up in this place for the last decade, beating his chest about being tough on borders. He'd then go on talkback radio and portray himself as a border patrol cop on the beat, a tough guy on immigration, boasting that he was keeping Australia safe from illegal arrivals. Yet now we know that all he did was oversee a system that was falling apart. Under his watch, there was nearly a 50 per cent reduction in the number of compliance officers in the nine years to 2022-23. Under his watch, criminals were left to abuse Australia's visa system. Under his watch, criminals exploited the most vulnerable. The migration system was used to facilitate some of the worst crimes in our society against those who needed our support and protection the most.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet, unlike him, the minister and the government will not turn a blind eye to the exploitation and negligence of people and will not turn a blind eye to genuine people who want to call Australia home. While these problems are systemic and will take time to fix, the government's response to the Nixon review demonstrates our commitment to cleaning up a mess left by the Leader of the Opposition. Australians deserve a migration system that works for them—one that is fair, one that prioritises skill migration, one that brings families together. We deserve a migration system that serves our national interests, not the interests of criminals. This review will also enable the government to weed out the cowboys in the migration industry, one that is long overdue. I commend the motion to the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:58</span>):  I must say I feel a bit for the member for Bennelong being sent in to do this today, because politics don't work when it comes to immigration; outcomes and results do. The fact that he is in here putting this motion today, when we've just found out this morning that 80 people have been released into the community who have failed the character test and have serious criminal convictions, and the government has been caught flat-footed and has no response as to how they're going to keep the community safe, just shows you how inept this government is. They had months to plan for this potential outcome, and they have sat on their hands and done nothing. As a matter of fact, they've been focused on everything else rather than keeping the community safe.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people want to know the answers for how they're going to be kept safe following this High Court decision. What action is the government taking to make sure that the release of these 80 individuals means that the community will be safe? We've read over the weekend in the paper that 30 of them were just sent to a hotel in the suburbs of Perth and no protections have been put in place. They don't know themselves what visas they're going to be put on. It seems that the Western Australia Police were not informed that this was happening. We now know that another 50 have been released into the community. There is no transparency whatsoever from this government as to what they are doing. Immigration is a mess under this government, and the mess continues to grow and grow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at what else has happened. We found out also—and, once again, there was no transparency—that, in September, 11 illegal maritime arrivals were sent to Nauru.</span>

                  </a>  Eleven! That's the first time in nine years that we've had to send IMOs to Nauru. Labor seems to take some sort of perverse delight in sending children to Nauru. Once again, it will be this government that has to clean up this mess.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the Nixon review, which is the rapid review that the government sat on for over six months. Let's just see what has happened when it comes to arrivals by plane under this government. According to the latest data, 25,887 plane arrivals have now sought asylum under Labor. September was the second month in a row that more than 2,000 asylum seekers have lodged a claim for protection under Labor. The number of failed asylum seekers awaiting deportation has grown to 75,862. Meanwhile, just 17 failed asylum seekers left the country in September. Labor have deported just 184 failed asylum seekers since they won the election. And this statistic is incredibly important: 11,242 asylum seekers lodged an asylum claim between the government receiving the Nixon review and announcing a response seven months later. That's right: the government has been going on about the need for urgent action, condemning the Leader of the Opposition et cetera, yet they sat on this rapid review for seven months and did nothing with it. That's how important they saw the review as being—seven months, and not a response. They didn't even release it when they got it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

Even though it had been sitting there for six months on the website of one of our media organisations, the government still wouldn't say whether that was or wasn't the review or when they were going to release it.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:03</span>):  At the end of 2014, Binjun Xie entered Australia on a student visa. He was to become known as 'The Hammer' because of his criminal activity. That year saw the transition of the immigration portfolio from the member for Cook to the now Leader of the Opposition. During Binjun Xie's nine years in this country, he established a sprawling underground network for people trafficking and prostitution. Some of those activities happened in Burwood in my electorate of Reid. Binjun Xie got rich by committing the most deplorable acts and exploiting vulnerable women. The extraordinary thing about this individual is that this was not the first time he'd engaged in this sort of criminal activity. Binjun Xie was jailed for five years in the UK for doing the exact same thing there. So let that sink in to the minds of those opposite. He was jailed for five years in the UK, deported back to China and then permitted to enter Australia to commit those crimes. The reality is that Binjun Xie<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>took advantage of an immigration system which those opposite had allowed to wither. However, Binjun Xie's case was not an isolated incident. The reality was: our immigration system was being exploited by criminal gangs and dodgy migration agents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In light of these revelations, the Minister for Home Affairs, Clare O'Neil, established the Rapid Review into the Exploitation of Australia's Visa System, run by Christine Nixon. The review uncovered details of the gaps and weaknesses in Australia's visa system that the coalition had left for us. It allowed abuses of sexual exploitation, migrant worker exploitation, human trafficking and other organised crimes. The weaknesses and gaps in our migration system were enabling the worst crimes known to humanity to occur in our country—gaps that people like Binjun Xie exploited. The coalition presided over a systemic failure in our immigration compliance system, and the Nixon review revealed that staffing cuts to the home affairs department, started by the former coalition government, undermined effective compliance. The then immigration minister, and now Leader of the Opposition, has been revealed as the great fraud that he is, because we know that, while the Leader of the Opposition talked a big game on immigration, he oversaw the fundamental underresourcing of the entire system. It was under his watch that criminals like Binjun Xie were allowed to bounce between the UK and Australia, committing some of the most vile crimes against vulnerable people in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are making concerted efforts to clean up the mess from those opposite—firstly, through resourcing. The Department of Home Affairs will receive an additional $50 million to establish a new immigration compliance division. This division will enhance immigration compliance and safeguard the integrity of the visa and migration system. Secondly, we will strengthen regulations around the conduct of migration agents. We will enhance the assessment of registered migration agents to ensure they meet stringent fit-and-proper-person criteria. We are also making it easier to penalise migration agents who are acting unethically, by strengthening the Migration Agents Registration Authority and raising the financial penalties for agents offering illegal assistance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The immigration system we inherited from the coalition is a mess. It is burdened by complexity. It incentivises temporary visas, making it difficult for anyone wanting to build a life here. Even the most basic function of compliance requires an overhaul. We've started cleaning up the mess left behind by those opposite—including deporting Binjun Xie in October this year, so he can no longer exploit vulnerable women. While I am relieved that he is no longer able to commit his heinous crimes in this country, I am sad and angry that he was allowed into this country in the first place. I'm sorry to all those women who have been hurt by his actions. I'm sorry to the Australian public. They deserve an immigration system that is in our country's national interests.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="219646" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:08</span>):  With all due respect to the member for Reid, we can all pick out isolated examples of situations where, yes, things could have been better, absolutely. But to then, from that example, paint a broadbrush picture of the immigration system under the previous government—a government in a parliament which you did not sit in—and then to say, by reading points straight from the Labor dirt unit, that all was unwell whilst the coalition was in government, is a step too far.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is coming from a side of politics that let in hundreds of boats and thousands of illegal arrivals. Many, many people died at sea under the policies of those opposite when they were in government. To suggest, for one moment, that the immigration system was in any way inadequate when we were in power is just preposterous, quite frankly. To the Labor dirt unit, if you're listening out there whilst you're typing up your stupid notes: you ought to realise that we did a lot of good whilst we were in power. We, in fact, fixed up the mess that Labor left behind—not, as is being put now, the other way around.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I'm speaking on behalf of the member for Mallee, who can't be here because she is unwell. But in her role as deputy chair of the current inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, it has become clear to her that the current immigration settings are not sufficient, she tells me, to supply the skilled and unskilled workforce we absolutely require—particularly in the regions. I know those regions aren't familiar to a lot of those opposite. They have this city-centric view of the world which doesn't cover the country areas, which are absolutely essential to the economic wellbeing of this nation and which are all-too-forgotten by those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under Labor, new data has revealed that the number of foreign student visas hit nearly 370,000 last financial year, which was 52 per cent higher than the record set in 2019. And 660,000 international students were either in Australia or ready to come—an all-time high. We want those students, but let's not forget that we have a crisis in this country to do with housing. We've got a crisis where we can't actually keep pace with the stock required. And then we have state Labor governments who want to shut down forestry and housing ministers who say, 'What's timber got to do with building houses?' Note to the housing minister: that's what we build houses from—timber. We have this situation with housing, and it is a crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's also a crisis with jobs; at the moment we just can't fill the vacancies—in particular, in regional Australia. In relation to agriculture, it is deeply regrettable that the Labor government has changed the rules around the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility scheme—the PALM scheme—requiring employers to offer a minimum of 30 hours a week, per week, to eligible migrant workers, because many providers of jobs are walking away from the PALM scheme. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that Labor discontinued the Australian Agriculture Visa Program initiated by the Nationals and established by the former coalition government to address workforce shortages in the sector. This is just so, so sad.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Worse still, Labor increased the temporary skilled migration income threshold from $53,900 to $70,000 from 1 July. We want to reward skilled migrants for the benefit they bring to the community and, coming from the Riverina, no-one knows this more than I do. We're a very multicultural place. Indeed, I would like to think that we're almost the cradle of multiculturalism in Australia. On Australia Day, many of my communities proudly fly more than 100 flags. In my hometown of Wagga Wagga, well in excess of 100 different nationalities reside in the city. They contribute to the city and contribute to Australia, and this is just fantastic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But many regional businesses in agriculture and tourism, just for example, are only busy enough to take on skilled migrants at harvest time or during the high season. For them, meeting the $70,000 annual threshold is nigh on impossible, leaving them unable to employ migrant workers. So we need to look at these things; Labor needs to look at these things. They remind me a little bit of the dog that chased the car, got the car and then didn't know what to do with it. That is Labor on immigration, that is Labor on employment and that is Labor on the economy. That is Labor, full stop.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:13</span>):  When Australia was formed, about 90 per cent of Australians were born here. Today, over 50 per cent of Australians were either born overseas or have a parent who was born overseas. Things change quickly. The original Department of Immigration was established in 1945. Its mission back then was nation-building and administering Australia's migration program—attracting the best and the brightest to make our nation a competitive global powerhouse, both economically and socially.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This great department operated a successful service for decades, overseeing the successful settlement of many, many migrants. Immigration lurched down the road to demise back in 2013, when the member for Cook became the immigration minister and approved the integration of immigration with Customs and the creation of the Australian Border Force. The complete takeover occurred under the current opposition leader's leadership, after he became the minister at the end of 2014. In 2017, after 72 years, the word 'immigration' was dropped from the department's title and the department was sucked into the vortex of Home Affairs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's a list of hits the coalition accomplished during their time overseeing this proud department. They refused to give staff a wage increase for six years. They shut down visa processing functions at approximately six overseas offices. They outsourced contact centres in Australia and overseas. They gutted client services in each state, including shutting down face-to-face immigration services from anywhere north of Brisbane. They cut visa processing staff by a third between 2015 and 2022, as onshore protections claims went through the roof. They halved the immigration compliance team, and they tried to privatise Australia's visa processing system to sell it off to the highest bidder. So, while the former Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government were focused on making staff miserable, overworking them and even wanting to sell their jobs, our migration system was also enabling some of the worst crimes known to humanity under the coalition's watch.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gaps and weaknesses in the immigration system allowed organised crime and unsavoury characters to thrive. The Nixon review, conducted by former police chief Ms Christine Nixon, found criminal syndicates exploited our visa system to facilitate human trafficking, modern slavery, illegal sex work, illicit drug importation and money laundering—something the former member for Moreton was endorsing, in fact. Temporary migrant workers were at such an elevated risk of being abused and exploited by their employers that it was almost a design feature of the immigration system. At a time of record skills shortages, the visa processing backlog surged to almost one million and protracted processing times ballooned, with some migrants waiting up to 2½ years, which has encouraged bad actors to lodge increasing numbers of non-genuine applications for protection, shifting resources away from authentic claims.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These failures stem from the previous coalition government's neglect of the home affairs department under the former immigration minister. There was a lack of care, attention and basic interest in one of the most important things the Australian government does. The opposition leader's greatest fraud is that, despite presenting himself as tough on borders, immigration compliance was deprioritised under the member for Dickson's watch. As I just mentioned, the coalition halved the immigration compliance team. These problems are systemic and will take time to fix, but, as our response to the Nixon review shows, we're acting to clean up the opposition leader's mess.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're establishing a new immigration compliance division to reprioritise immigration compliance and protect the integrity of the visa and migration system. It will include new risk and integrity teams to target the organised abuse of immigration programs and protect vulnerable community members from exploitation. It will work to resolve the immigration status of those people whose onshore visa options have been exhausted and to improve protections for vulnerable migrants. We're also strengthening fit-and-proper-person assessments for registered migration agents and improving the Office of the Migration Agents Registration Authority's ability to sanction unscrupulous registered agents—those that milk the system and send their clients down the wrong path just for money. We're also increasing financial penalties for providing unlawful immigration assistance; I'm forever meeting with constituents who have been given bad advice by unscrupulous registered agents. These reforms will provide a stronger framework for the OMARA to address criminality in the migration advice industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government will not turn a blind eye to the exploitation of Australia's visa system, as occurred under the member for Cook and the member for Dickson. We need to get the balance right and look at our resources.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SPENDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:18</span>):  Migration is central to the story of Australia. As the daughter of a migrant, I know firsthand the contribution that migrants make to our wonderful and diverse society and the opportunities Australia can provide for those who come to our shores to work, study and live.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When migrants come to Australia, they expect a fair place to live and work. But too often they're subject to exploitation. We have heard shocking stories of trafficking, sexual exploitation, wage theft, bullying and assault. One of my constituents told me how she suffered such exploitation. She came to Australia on a training visa, working for an accounting firm. She worked for the firm for six months yet never received her full wages she was owed. Similarly, other trainees suffered. Her story is all too common.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Research by the Grattan Institute suggests that one in six migrants who recently arrived in Australia experience some form of exploitation at work. This is a terrible affliction for the individuals affected, but it also harms the vast majority of Australian businesses who are doing the right thing, and it damages Australia's ability to attract the workers we need for the economy to prosper. As well as being a place to live and work, Australia has for decades provided a home for people who have lost theirs because of wars, disasters and atrocities. But the Nixon review identified that the migration system has not been working for those with genuine claims for asylum. Because of inadequate resources and a process that lacks robustness and integrity, humanitarian pathways have been clogged up by people who are trying to game the system. The tragedy is that people with genuine claims, who are genuinely fleeing persecution, have been made to wait for years on end to have their cases assessed, forcing them to depend on charities and the community to make ends meet. Many others seeking asylum have also been denied the right to even a life in the community and, instead, have faced many months in detention.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, the average period for which the Australian government holds people in detention is a staggering 708 days, and 124 people in detention today have been detained for over five years. The sad truth is that our migration system has been exploited and politicised. We need to have an honest, compassionate conversation about migration, not further wedging based on fear of people overseas. Several of the measures identified by the Nixon review are welcome—in particular, the increase in resourcing for home affairs and the prioritisation of asylum claims. But this must not be the limit of reform, and there are real challenges that I do not believe the government is addressing. First, the new 'first in, first out' rule for asylum claims is great for those submitting new claims, but it leaves many of those with an existing claim waiting even longer. Especially given the current cost-of-living crisis and the difficult situation of many people seeking refugee status in this country, those whose circumstances suggest that they have a genuine protection claim must be better financially supported whilst their claim is processed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, we must improve the integrity of our migration program in other areas, particularly in student visas. Australia offers international students generous rights to stay and work here after they graduate, and that is appropriate in many, many cases. These people make a huge contribution to Australia and often become permanent residents. But the Grattan Institute shows that, in some cases, we give false hope to thousands of graduates who will never gain permanent residency. This is adding to population pressures and threatens Australia's reputation as a destination for tertiary study. Indeed, only half of temporary graduates secure full-time employment, and most are working low-skilled jobs, earning less than $53,000 a year. In various reviews, the many examples of student visa holders who are not studying genuine programs and are not even attending their claimed course of study give further cause for concern.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, I think the federal government's policy is moving in the wrong direction in this area. The recent decision to allow many graduates to stay and work for even longer without any restrictions based on their ability to actually get a job in their area of study and their ability to support themselves over this period of time is going to lead to a doubling of the number of temporary graduate visa holders in Australia by 2030. It is a situation which is not in the interests of our economy or the graduates themselves and, again, sets unrealistic expectations about their ability to move to Australia permanently. I urge the government to give this issue further scrutiny.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Third, we need to get on with implementing the priority reforms to our skilled migration system. The government has set out a very positive direction of travel to create a more streamlined approach for businesses to employ skilled migrants. But we need to get on with implementing this.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Obesity is an extremely complex health condition. It's a global issue with rates steadily increasing since the 1970s, as you would be aware, when obesity was uncommon. Alarmingly, in most regions across the world, there are now more people that are overweight than there are, in fact, underweight. Australia is not immune from this global health crisis. In fact, we have one of the highest rates of obesity in the world. Based on 2021 data, across OECD countries, Australia has the fourth-highest population of men and ninth-highest proportion of females living with obesity. This equates to around 14 million Australians living with overweight or obesity. Let's unpack this a little further: that's one in four children, two in three adults, and one in two young people aged between 18 and 24. Alarmingly, modelling is suggesting that the incidence of obesity will continue to increase over coming decades. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Living with obesity significantly impacts a person's life. It's not simply the mechanical stress and the limitations placed on the body carrying that extra weight. Being overweight or obese also results in serious health consequences. In fact, these conditions are amongst the highest contributors to disease and the disease burden within our country. Those living with obesity are at far higher risk of developing chronic conditions, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, asthma, back pain, chronic kidney disease, issues with reproductive functioning, dementia, gall bladder disease, gout, osteoarthritis and at least 13 different forms of cancer. If you overlay these serious health conditions with the impact on mental health, social interactions and employment opportunities, it is clear that obesity limits the opportunity for one to live a full and complete life. As a government, we must do more to combat the unabated surge of overweight and obesity in our community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In March 2022, the former coalition government developed the first National Obesity Strategy. This strategy acknowledges the root causes of overweight and obesity are incredibly complex and deeply embedded in the way we live our lives. The work undertaken to produce the National Obesity Strategy was a crucial first step. I call on this government to continue this important work and to evaluate obesity as a health priority area. Stemming the rise of obesity will only be achieved through collaboration across all stakeholders, all levels of government, all non-government organisations, communities and businesses alike. We must embrace all the tools that we have at our disposal, put everything on the table, and focus on innovation and emerging technologies alongside lifestyle interventions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, as the shadow assistant minister for health, it is always an absolute pleasure to sit down with our industry leaders, our experts, our brightest and our best who have dedicated their lives to advocating for, and improving the health outcomes of, all Australians. Similar to the treatment for other chronic diseases, I'm being told that we need to embrace tools beyond lifestyle interventions to deliver better health outcomes for those battling overweight or obesity. These medications, in conjunction with lifestyle interventions, must form part of ongoing treatment for this terrible condition. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that obesity disproportionately affects vulnerable sections of our community, including our First Nations Australians, our Australians living in regional and remote areas and older Australians alike—those least able to afford the full cost of emerging medical treatments for obesity. I therefore urge this government to ensure that medications that have been approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration are listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme as a matter of priority, to reflect the urgent nature of this health crisis. Unless the federal government takes the lead on this and plays its part, then we'll never combat the unabated surge of overweight and obesity in our communities. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MILLER-FROST</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:29</span>):  Two-thirds of Australian adults now live with overweight or obesity and 25 per cent of Australian children aged two to 17 are either overweight or obese. This is a public health crisis. Being overweight or obese is a substantial risk factor for many conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. It's a public health issue because, while the impact of being obese or overweight is borne by individuals, it is a society-wide issue with causes that impact all of us to some degree.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The rate of Australians who are either overweight or obese has risen since the 1970s, and there are two major changes we have seen at the society level that are linked to this. The first is the rise of energy-dense and nutrient-poor food. While we point the finger at fast food and highly processed food, there are also foods that we might otherwise consider to be relatively healthy which have additional fats, sugars and salt added to increase shelf life and taste. This is compounded by the fact that, as we become more time-poor, we are less likely to have the time to source and cook fresh, healthy food, the nutrient-rich and lower energy food that our bodies need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second change is that we are increasingly a more sedentary society. While we used to get a lot of incidental activity in our lifestyles, many of us now spend more time sitting at work and leisure and, instead of walking places, we're more likely to drive even short distances.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Addressing overweight or obesity generally does require lifestyle change, which sounds so easy but really isn't because we're asking individuals to make ongoing changes in their lifestyles, not just do a one-off activity that once done stays done. We're asking people to make a different choice in terms of their diet and activity levels all day, every day. This happens in the context of the society we live in, the choices that are put in front of us every day and the pressures and activities that each individual needs to fulfil to meet their other obligations to family and to work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's helpful to have a team on your side. A local GP can be a great support in making and continuing changes as well as monitoring general health. The Albanese government is strengthening Medicare, making it cheaper and easier to see a GP so that Australians have support to take actions that promote good health. The recent tripling of the bulk-billing incentive is an important part of that and one that I know has been very welcomed in Boothby. We have also introduced a new Medicare rebate for consultations of 60 minutes or longer. This enables doctors to provide intensive support to people with complex needs, such as those who are overweight or obese.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have made additional investments to support primary health networks to improve access for multicultural communities, and we're updating the 2013 clinical practice guidelines for the management of overweight and obesity to reflect current research. We have invested in incentive payments for healthcare providers to deliver wraparound tailored care to keep patients with complex conditions healthy in the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But addressing overweight and obesity is not just an issue for the health system. We need broader societal measures. So we are collaborating with the food industry to make positive changes in their products, such as food reformulations and appropriate portion sizes. We have asked Food Standards Australia and New Zealand to review nutritional labelling around added sugars to empower consumers to make the right choice for themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other part of the puzzle is activity levels. We're investing in services such as Reclink, which provides a fun sport and recreation program for disadvantaged Australians, because having fun is part of maintaining motivation. Our Sporting Schools program will build participation in physical activity in school-aged children, and we're working with the Australian Sports Commission to deliver a national sports participation program aimed at physically inactive populations and those who have stopped playing sport.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Overweight and obesity is one of those wicked problems around the world and it's no different here at home in Australia. We as a society need to work together, all of us, particularly those who are affected, or we will start to see life expectancy heading backwards.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="281513" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs McINTOSH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:34</span>):  Firstly, I'd like to thank my friend the member for Braddon for bringing this important motion to the House today. The breadth of the motion explains the extent of the chronic conditions around obesity and the detrimental impact this is having on the full breadth of the Australian population. There is no doubt that the level of obesity in this country is a public health crisis. It is extraordinary that two in three Australian adults are overweight or obese. What's worse is that we are seeing kids as young as five—we've also heard of kids as young as two—being obese. One in four kids aged five to 17 and one in two aged 18 to 24 are overweight or obese. You can just imagine the health outcomes they are going to have when they are adults if we don't take this seriously.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own electorate of Lindsay, Penrith City Council notes that almost 70 per cent of adults and over a quarter of local kids are overweight or obese. We have some of the highest rates of obesity in New South Wales. Prevention, I believe, is key. Parents, schools, community organisations, healthcare practitioners and governments need to come together and strategise and plan ways to ensure our children are not impacted. That is why the National Obesity Strategy, as mentioned by the member for Braddon, is absolutely key—not just having a strategy, but being focused on its implementation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need a strong national campaign to promote sport and activity and healthy living in every corner of Australia. Many of us in this place recently took part in AUSactive's Fit for Office challenge, and even though that was just a snapshot of the activity requirements, it's really important for us to be leading by example. It's why I started the Lindsay Healthy Active Living Network as soon as I stepped into this role as the member for Lindsay—because it is a serious issue in my community. Local sporting organisations, health practitioners and clinicians all come together to discuss some of the outcomes of what's happening in the community, and, most importantly, we discuss the practical things that we can be doing on the ground. It's also why I have been committed to delivering sporting and community facilities and upgrades in our community, for young people playing sport and participating in cricket and martial arts. Kids, as we all know, are footy mad in Penrith, with the Panthers as our great team—our winners—inspiring a new generation of kids participating in sport. Finding a sport or activity is key to lowering the risk of obesity in the future, including type 2 diabetes and mental health issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're blessed to have the Nepean River in my community. We have such amazing places to walk. We have parks, walking trails and nature reserves. We have all these things, but we still have some of the highest rates of obesity. That's because the opportunities might be there to take up these sports and activities, but, sometimes, there is just so much more at play contributing to people's health outcomes. I want to give a shout-out to Dr Kathryn Williams, who works at Nepean Hospital in Lindsay, because she sees this every day. She's a clinical lead and manager of the Nepean Family Metabolic Health Services and is head of endocrinology at Nepean Hospital. She is a researcher and a senior lecturer at the University of Sydney. She works with some of the most severe cases of obesity, and, unfortunately, there is a backlog of hundreds of Western Sydney patients who need her care. She's an advocate for pharmaceutical intervention to assist with weight loss for patients, alongside a healthy diet with regular exercise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to note as deputy chair of the health committee that—and I note the chair is here—we are working really hard on the current inquiry into obesity and diabetes and the correlation between the two, with a particular focus on diabetes. This is absolutely important, and it shows how serious we are in this place to solve this public health crisis.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:39</span>):  It's common knowledge that from time to time I enjoy a burger, or sometimes two. Eating all of these burgers, in the name of supporting local businesses of the Hunter, sometimes reminds me that it's also important to keep an eye on my weight. While I am an athlete and an Olympian, it is no secret that I am not the same shape as some of the other athletes in the athletes village at the Olympics. And that's okay. Not everyone needs to be lean and ripped like an Olympic sprinter. There's nothing wrong with having a little bit of a dad bod.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's very important to be careful about your weight, because obesity is a big issue in Australia. Obesity can bring a whole heap of health issues, like higher risk of developing chronic conditions, including 13 different types of cancer, cardiovascular disease, asthma, back pain, chronic kidney disease, dementia, gall bladder disease and osteoarthritis. Most of us could avoid having to deal with these kinds of health challenges if we just lived a little bit healthier and got on top of our weight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no better way to look after your health and to stay on top of your weight than to play sport. This government loves sport, and we have invested a significant amount of money in a range of different areas to help promote sport and to make sure that more Aussies out there are being active and doing what comes naturally to most Australians, which is playing sport. We have committed $2.6 million to increase basketball participation amongst First Nations and culturally and linguistically diverse communities and to implement the national Multicultural Program for basketball. This goes alongside $3.1 million over two years to support the legacy of the FIFA Women's World Cup 2023 by supporting women and girls to participate in football through the MiniRoos for Girls Program and the Girls 12+ Football Your Way Engagement Experience Program, and $4.4 million to the ICC T20 Men's World Cup 2022 to support the implementation of a multicultural, strategic framework, including participation legacy programs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also invested $10.3 million over two years for the Australian Sports Commission to continue delivery of national sport participation programs targeted at populations currently physically inactive or individuals who have dropped out of sport, and $79.6 million over three years to continue the government's flagship sport and physical activity program for children, Sporting Schools, for the 2023 and 2024 school years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also multiple preventive health initiatives which are specifically targeted at promoting healthy weight. These initiatives include the Healthy Food Partnership, Health Star Rating system, sugar labelling, physical activity and sedentary behaviour guidelines and 24-hour movement guidelines. The National Health and Medical Research Council is currently undertaking a review of the 2013 Australian Dietary Guidelines to make sure the guidelines are based on current evidence and are up to date.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Being on top of your weight helps you to be on top of your health. We are a government committed to making it easier for Australians to get on top of their health by strengthening Medicare. This commitment includes a $3.5 billion investment to triple the bulk-billing incentive, the largest increase to the incentive in the 40-year history of Medicare. This is a good way to respond to the public health crisis of obesity, because making it easy to see a doctor means we can help more Australians to take actions that promote good health and prevent chronic illnesses which are linked to lifestyle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not everyone can be in perfect health and maintain the perfect weight—it's just not practical—but we can all do our bit by being mindful that obesity is a huge issue and keeping an eye on our weight by living a healthier lifestyle. So get out there and play some sport. Make sure you keep an eye out for dietary guidelines and make smarter decisions about what you eat by looking at things like the Health Star Rating. Importantly, if you need some help or advice about your weight or any other health issue, go to see a doctor. It should be a lot easier and cheaper to see them now. Let's all do our bit to live a healthier life and reduce the risks of developing any of the consequences that may come with obesity. We owe it to our loved ones, and we owe it to ourselves. Remember: abs are made in the kitchen, not in the gym.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:44</span>):  I thank the member for Braddon for this motion that paves the way for a discussion on obesity, our nation's health and steps that can be taken to ensure that all Australians can live healthy and fulfilling lives. As co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Nutrition, and having just come from an event this morning with a focus on nutrition and mental health, it's a policy area I'm particularly passionate about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do agree that new pharmacotherapies for obesity have the potential to be a game changer in the fight against obesity and recognise that, for some, new drugs have provided an opportunity to succeed in their goal of losing weight after every other attempt has failed. I think it's important that those in need are supported as they seek to change their lifestyle. New medications may play a role in some circumstances and, as the member for Braddon acknowledged, addressing obesity will realise benefits in multiple areas of the healthcare system and economy. However, I'm a firm believer that investment in preventive health measures should be paramount, as is educating how we can nourish our bodies. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we do know about the new pharmacotherapies is that to be effective a patient may need to take them long term, and we are yet to see what effects the medication has on a patient's health over a long period of time. There are some concerns from professionals in the industry that any sudden restriction of food can lead to malnourishment, and I think it would be reasonable to suggest that access to accredited dietitians ought to be considered by anyone seeking to use weight loss drugs, to ensure that overall nutrient needs are met. Perhaps this could form part of a formal plan when seeking a prescription from a GP.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was struck by a comment that Australian of the Year, Taryn Brumfitt, made during her address to the National Press Club a few weeks ago. When asked about her thoughts on weight loss drugs Taryn replied:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… it's doing us such a great disservice to talk about it … people who appreciate and feel good about their bodies are more likely to move their bodies, they're more likely to eat fruit and vegetables … they're less likely to drink, smoke, take illicit drugs, vape … The list of the reasons why we would want to get everyone in this country to embrace their bodies and feel good about their bodies is really long.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that physical inactivity is a major risk factor for chronic disease, and Tasmanians consistently outrank our mainland counterparts in the chronic disease statistics. According to a national health survey a few years ago, the typical Australian is a non-smoker and has never smoked, does 42 minutes of exercise every day, is overweight or obese and doesn't eat enough vegetables. In a wealthy country like Australia with a first-class health system stats like this and the fact that 50 per cent of Australians live with a chronic disease are startling. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also think there's a privilege that's often not discuss when it comes to building healthy habits. We often overlook the availability, affordability and accessibility to nutritious food, green spaces, public transport, healthcare services and education and employment prospects. The further away you get from urban areas the more difficult this gets. Food insecurity is a major barrier to a healthy lifestyle. Research carried out in the UK in 2020 on more than 600 adults found that food insecurity was associated with a poorer diet and that greater distress and eating to cope were linked with a high BMI.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no magic answer or cure-all for obesity, but increasing accessibility to nutritious food, education on how to grow food and cook healthy basics, and availability of spaces or programs that encourage movement are a start. I love the idea—and it's one I have seen borne out in the northern Tasmanian region—of free community fitness classes and health programs, as done by Healthy Tasmania. I've mentioned the Healthy Tasmania team several times in health related speeches here in parliament, as I've seen firsthand how a small investment in their evidence based health programs works. I will always advocate for their place based programs to continue in my electorate. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Their multi-award-winning programs cover smoking cessation, physical inactivity, mental health, healthy eating and obesity and are delivered across multiple settings from the home to schools, tertiary education institutions, workplaces and community settings. To date their major program Active Launceston has delivered 249 community programs and engaged 13,826 attendees attending 38,370 sessions, amounting to an incredible 45,732.5 hours of physical activity.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the member for Braddon for calling on the government to elevate obesity as a national health priority area. I think careful thought and planning need to be placed into significant education programs starting at an early age underpinned by investment in accessible community exercise and nutrition classes that could begin to move the dial on our nation's health statistics.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="290544" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ANANDA-RAJAH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:49</span>):  I thank the member for Braddon for bringing forth this very important motion. When it comes to overweight and obesity, Australia unfortunately punches well above its weight. Australia is a wealthy country, and in the club of OECD countries, a number of 32 countries that are mostly wealthy, Australia ranks fifth in countries with problems ranging from obesity to overweight. One-third of Australian adults are living with obesity. That's about 14 million Australians, and it includes two-out-of-every-three adults as well as one-in-four children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To be clear so that we all understand what we're talking about here, overweight relates to a BMI of 25 or above, and obese relates to a BMI of 30 and above. However, in my practice, I have looked after patients who are in the super-obese range. The highest weight patient I ever looked after had a weight of 180 kilos. This unfortunate gentleman had to be broken out of his house in order to be brought to hospital. He remained in hospital for several months, where I looked after him for a period of three months. He was there for us to try and initiate bariatric surgery—this is stomach stapling essentially. It was a really difficult process, managing him and managing all his chronic health problems. Unfortunately, despite us getting agreement from the surgeons, which was a long and arduous affair of negotiation and investigations, when he was finally taken to theatre, they opened him up only to then close him. Why? Because they found that he had already developed cirrhosis of his liver. This occurs because of fatty infiltration of the liver. When that happens, it is a dealbreaker. No surgeon will operate any further, because essentially the patient is now on a fairly terminal trajectory. These are some of the hidden impacts of obesity, and I would actually say that there are many, many Australians walking around who probably have early features of fatty infiltration of their liver, and, if that's the case, they really should go and see their doctor and seek some advice on what to do next.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians do want an environment that makes it easier to lead healthier lives. I live in one of those environments, where I see people walking, walking their dogs or running and jogging. They have access to healthy food, particularly fresh food. They also have access to unhealthy food, but the healthy food is abundant and it is easy to get. And it's predominantly an educated electorate—60 per cent of my constituents have a degree or a diploma. And people have access to public transport. So they're enabled to make active, healthy choices. In addition, it's a safe community. It is actually safe to walk down the street—it is safe to go jogging, either in the morning or in the evenings or indeed at night-time—and people somehow make time to factor exercise into their day, even though they are busy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not the case with Australians all around this country. Many Australians live in communities which, frankly, are unsafe, and many Australians are struggling to get by and they simply do not have the time. It seems a luxury to look after themselves—particularly women, particularly mothers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, we take for granted some of the basics. Most of the communities we live in have access to clean water. There are, in fact, around 250,000 Australians, mostly First Nations communities, who do not even have access to clean water. This is why we are contributing $150 million to First Nations water security. It is unclear to me as to why, in 2023, we have this situation, but what it is doing is accelerating diabetes in those communities. Why? Because they're resorting to soft drink and sugary drinks rather than to clean water.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm currently sitting on a health committee which is looking at diabetes and obesity in this country, and we are finding out that First Nations communities, including children as young as three, are developing type 2 diabetes despite having a normal BMI. This is clearly unacceptable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we need is a whole-of-nation approach to solving this problem, and that includes leadership from our end—from every person in this parliament—and the use of evidence and data and investing in implementation so that we actually help Australians make better choices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We obviously also need to destigmatise being obese and overweight, because it only feeds into the problem. It makes it harder to actually shed those extra kilos.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BROADBENT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:54</span>):  I congratulate the member for Braddon for bringing this very important motion before the parliament today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is an epidemic of obesity in this country and in developed countries around the world. Australia ranks fifth among OECD countries, with nearly a third of all Australians living with obesity—I said a third of all Australians are living with obesity. This problem is hugely embarrassing for a nation as wealthy as ours. Obesity is expected to cost this nation some $87 billion over the next 10 years. We'd have to question why we're not doing more to address this issue. I appreciate the previous speaker, the member for Higgins, giving a doctor's perspective on this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I grew up in a community, a very small community, in country Victoria, where all of our food came from within 10 kays of where we lived. If anyone looked at me they'd say, 'That's a long time ago,' but in my school and realm, there were very few obese children—very few. What was different about them? Looking back, they were from poorer families that didn't have the access to food that people like myself and most of the community had. And it was hereditary; there were generations of people who were not wealthy and who were different because they had access to different types of food to what we were having.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even today, 40 per cent of the food that we consume is coming packaged—not necessarily from a supermarket, but packaged food. That's 40 per cent packaged food being consumed by the community. Something happened to me not long ago—and I won't name the township I was in—when I went to polling booths on election day. This community had gone from a small country community to an outer suburban community where they had Hungry Jack's, McDonald's, Red Rooster and all those sorts of things that they didn't have before. When I went to that community, I noticed the difference from the sixties and seventies. Then, there were very few obese people in the community, but on that election day, as I was handing out how-to-vote cards for Russell Broadbent, I noticed that there was obese family, after obese family, after obese family coming into the booths. I had never seen that there before. This was phenomenal to me, because that community had never had the type of dramatic change that I could see presented in front of me that day. People who were obese were so hot, on a very cool day—when I had a jacket on—that they had T-shirts and shorts on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was very clear from the parents and the children that they had the same diet. What have we done over these past years that has made this dramatic change? Is it cheaper to stop in at McDonald's on your way past? Is it cheaper not to buy the fresh food at the supermarket? I don't know what we've done, but this nation desperately needs a change of focus, particularly in health care, to point to issues that have to start at the family level and at the school level—at every level we can. When you see little, active kids—where you see Nippers down the beach—you don't see obese kids. They're active and their families are active—that's generational as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I put it to you, Mr Speaker, that on this day Australians should think very carefully as to how they're feeding this generation and the generations to come. This is a great opportunity for this nation to change its ways.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:59</span>):  Very briefly: I'm a worried man. I'm worried that, as a paediatrician, I'm seeing children in the preschool-aged group with morbid obesity. I'm worried that we're poisoning our children and our adolescents with the food that we're giving them. I'm worried that we have an obesity epidemic that is urgent. It is severely effecting health care in this country. We've watched this evolve over the last 20 years and done very little about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is urgent that we act on this major health priority, and that includes things like advertising the dangers of the foods that we're offering. Highly processed foods are killing our kids, killing our adults and killing our elderly. It has to stop. It has to change. We need to have proper food labelling. I don't want to know the kilojoule count of a bottle of lemonade. I want to know how many teaspoons of sugar are in that bottle. I want people to understand that they shouldn't advertise junk food, highly processed food, to our children and adolescents. This has to stop. This is a major epidemic, and we are doing very little about it. Times must change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm a paediatrician. I should not be seeing children as young as four with morbid obesity. They will inevitably develop liver disease, cardiovascular disease, blindness—a whole range of health priorities. We're also seeing an epidemic of gestational diabetes, and that has long-term implications for our children and their risk of developing obesity, diabetes and all that goes with it. We need to stop being judgemental. We need to do things that work. We need to stop lecturing people. It's time for action and change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think there are many, many health priorities in this country but obesity and type 2 diabetes should be at the top of the list. We have to act on this. All of my medical colleagues, no matter what field they're in, are seeing increases in issues. Vascular surgeons are seeing many more amputations than they've ever seen before because of diabetes and the risks of vascular disease. Our eye doctors are seeing more retinal disease and more blindness because of diabetes. Out liver specialists are seeing more people needing liver transplants because of the risk of fatty liver due to diabetes and obesity. We are seeing many more people unable to work because of the skeletal effects of massive obesity. Our hospital systems are being overwhelmed by people with diabetes and the complications thereof.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is much to be done. Our government is acting by looking at how we can better manage chronic illness, such as diabetes, in general practice. People need access to primary care and general practice so that they can deal with the complications of their diabetes and obesity. We need a national education program that teaches people about the dangers of the foods that we have developed through—</span>

This includes aggregate information and statistics about the occupation, the main job task, the industry and the state of residence of diagnosed individuals at the time they were exposed to respiratory disease causing agents. This aligns with the data that our government had intended to report on, so we are happy to support this amendment, which received cross-party support in the Senate.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the benefit of the House, I'll explain what is occurring. The minister has just moved that the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Small Business Redundancy Exemption) Bill 2023 be made an order of the day for the next sitting. As a consequence, I've moved an amendment to this motion such that debate on this bill can proceed immediately. As <span style="font-style:italic;">Practice</span> makes clear, the debate the House is now conducting is not, in and of itself, about the content of the bill that has just been read a first time. Rather, it's about the programming of debate and therefore about what this House judges to be most important to consider at any point in time. The purpose of the motion that I have moved would be to bring this bill on for debate in this House immediately.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me explain why the opposition has moved this motion. As those on this side of the chamber strongly believe, small businesses and, indeed, their employees are the very backbone of the Australian economy. This private senator's bill, which passed the Senate last week and has now been transmitted to this House, has the effect of ensuring that employees do not miss out on redundancy payments merely because their employer became a small business by reason of an insolvency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This will support equitable outcomes for claimants under the Fair Entitlements Guarantee. That's to say this bill addresses an anomaly which causes some employees to miss out on a National Employment Standards entitlement to redundancy pay, which would otherwise have been payable at the end of their employment. This can occur when an employer downsizes, due to insolvency, to fewer than 15 staff, thereby becoming a small business employer and therefore exempt, in the law as it presently stands, from providing redundancy pay to employees under the National Employment Standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This private senator's bill, which the opposition is advocating ought to be considered by this chamber immediately, would not make any change to how the small-business redundancy exemption currently applies to viable small businesses, including those that have restructured from being a larger employer and are continuing to trade. It would only change how the small-business redundancy exemption applies to employers that are bankrupt or in liquidation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to note that all business groups support this change. This is now an opportunity for the chamber, including the government, the opposition and crossbenchers, to express their support for this important change. It is, I think, uncontroversial to say that small business plays a very important role in our economy. That is a view that's expressed across the chamber. I want to acknowledge, for example, that the recently arrived member for Aston recently had this to say about the need to support and protect employees of small businesses: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We understand very well the pressures faced by small businesses, and they will not be punished for honest mistakes … I will continue to fight for the small businesses in my electorate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a matter, therefore, of considerable importance. That was the view of the Senate, which passed this bill last week. The government in the other place did not vote against this bill, which has now been transmitted to this House. Indeed the government did not even call for a division on this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've outlined, the provisions in this bill would ensure that employees are compensated accordingly when a small business becomes insolvent. It goes some way toward fairly shielding employees. You would think that, in a cost-of-living crisis, this would be precisely the sort of measure that the government would be minded to move rapidly to support. We may well hear a range of arguments about why the procedural motion that the opposition is moving at this time ought not to be supported. I want to, therefore, make some points for the information of members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's entirely open to the House to determine how and when it considers business. The government's agenda is an input, but it's not determinative. The very fact that the House is even giving consideration to this is evidence of that proposition. There is nothing wrong, in procedural terms nor in principle, with this House choosing to move rapidly to deal with a matter which has been dealt with in the other place. That's a decision for this House to make on the merits of the bill. We may well hear that it is somehow problematic in process terms for this private senator's bill that's passed the Senate to now be debated and voted upon immediately by this House. We may also hear arguments that this creates procedural difficulties because there is an identical provision in the government's so-called closing loopholes legislation, which is making its way through the various parliamentary processes. The simple fact is that, if this bill were to pass this House, it would be an entirely routine matter for the government—at the consideration and detail stage of debate—to omit from its closing loopholes bill the provision which would have already taken legal effect under this bill, should it pass this House. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It may be argued that debating this and considering this right now is in some way distracting the attention of the House from matters which are of greater urgency. That argument would have a lot more credibility if it were not for the actions that this government took to minimise the amount of work being done by this House only a few weeks ago. The government cancelled a week of sittings on the basis that the Prime Minister had some international travel and the government was not keen for that to be interfered with. Any argument that might be made that this is in some way distracting or diverting the House from other urgent matters which need to be dealt with is not an argument which ought to be given very serious consideration. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I might make the point that when those opposite were in opposition, from time to time they offered procedural motions of exactly this kind, again argued on the basis that the substance of the bill that a minister had just sought to effectively kick into the long grass—which is, let's have no doubt, exactly what the Leader of the House has just sought to do—was a matter of priority and that the House should consider it. I'm not going to get into the merits of what was argued there, because it was clearly misconceived. What is very different here is the urgency of the matter which this bill, moved and passed by the Senate, would give effect to. It is a set of changes that deal with the circumstances of employees who are facing redundancy. It deals with the particular issue where, the employer having moved from being a larger business to being a small business by reason of having gone into insolvency, the employee, through no fault of their own, is therefore suddenly excluded from being able to access support that would otherwise be available.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear that the government also considers this to be an important matter because the government itself has included such a provision in its broader so-called closing loopholes bill. But the fact is that this House now has an opportunity to consider, vote upon and pass this bill, the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Small Business Redundancy Exemption) Bill 2023, immediately. I think that most fair-minded Australians would, frankly, be mystified at the government's proposition about a bill embodying a provision which the government itself has brought forward and about which the government itself has necessarily said to the parliament and to the people of Australia, 'This is a sensible provision. This is a necessary provision.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here on the opposition side of the chamber we are simply providing the government and, indeed, the parliament with the opportunity to vote upon this provision immediately and to bring it into law very quickly. This is as opposed to the approach that the minister is putting to the House, which is that this matter should not be dealt with now but should be deferred indefinitely. This is an important matter; the government has been telling us for some months that it's an important matter. The opposition agrees that it's an important matter, businesses agree that it's an important matter and I understand unions agree that it's an important matter. The House has a chance to deal with it now, and that is the basis for the amendment that I've moved, so I commend the motion to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Page</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition </span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:16</span>):  I rise to speak in support of the amendment of the Manager of Opposition Business. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, after listening to us, might decide that what we're doing here is a measure of goodwill. We are here trying to help the government today, we are here agreeing with the government today and we are here to help the government this afternoon because, from what the Manager of Opposition Business has just explained, there is obviously a more complex piece of legislation, the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Closing Loopholes) Bill 2023, that is being held up in the Senate. It's going to be so for many months. It won't be coming back to this chamber until next year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the Senate, in its wisdom, has decided to pass certain subsets of the closing loopholes legislation with which we on the opposition benches agree. As a goodwill gesture when this subset of the legislation went through, many ministers and many members opposite spoke very passionately about this part of it, the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Small Business Redundancy Exemption) Bill 2023. They also spoke about the urgency of it and that it was really important that it happen ASAP. It wasn't just that this had to go through; it had to happen with great urgency. So we are here to help this amendment go through today—not today, this afternoon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just remind the House of what this is about. This is about the fact that employees should not miss out on redundancy payments because their employer has gone bankrupt or become insolvent. Who could disagree with that? Is that the fault of the employee? No, it's not the fault of the employee. The government knows that. The opposition knows that. If this procedural motion goes through, we can make sure that those employees are looked after almost immediately.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Manager of Opposition Business also mentioned that small business advocates and just about every advocacy group around the country supports this. We support it. The government supports it. This can happen today. So I'm very optimistically standing here today. I know the minister is very passionate about all parts of the legislation that he moved previously with the closing loopholes legislation, and I know he's as passionate about this part of it as he is about all other parts of it, so I think he's disappointed that the closing loopholes legislation won't be coming back from the Senate for quite some time. Given his passion for the issue, I understand his disappointment about that, but the good news is that we can do this right now. Maybe he hadn't thought about it, so I commend the Manager of Opposition Business for moving this procedural motion so that we can move on this today. I'm excited, the members of the opposition are excited and the government is excited, so I support and second this motion.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BIRRELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Nicholls</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:20</span>):  It's been fascinating to see how parliament works as a new member. I've been very impressed with what I've seen in the Senate recently with the omnibus bill. An omnibus bill is when you chuck everything in. Overall, it's a bad piece of legislation, in our view, but it has some good things in it. What the Senate has done, which I think is very sensible, is to take out the bits that we all agree on that are important and that are important to pass immediately and to do that so that we can get on with debating the stuff that we don't agree on. That's a very sensible thing to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As both the member for Bradfield and the member for Paige said, I've sat on these benches during the debate on industrial relations, and the urgency in which some of these things need to be passed has been expressed by all members who've spoken on the bill. We need to get it done. We need to make sure that these things are enacted in legislation so that workers are protected. In this case, it's redundancy payments for small businesses that might have become bankrupt or insolvent. Given that urgency was expressed when the senators, in their wisdom, took out those parts that we agreed on and said, 'Let's pass those to get them done urgently, and we'll debate the rest later,' I would have thought, as a new member of parliament, that that's one of the more sensible things I've seen the Senate do—and the Senate doesn't always seem like a sensible place from where I sit. But they've done that. It's constructive. It's proactive. It means that good pieces of legislation get pulled out of bad omnibus bills and that we can pass them. We can show the Australian people that we're not about politics, but we're about getting good pieces of legislation, which have bipartisan support, agreed to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a test for the government. Is this about politics? Is this about either passing the whole bill or passing none of it? Are you prepared to do something for the Australian people? Are you prepared to work constructively with the opposition who have come into this place and said: 'Okay, guys, we're having an argument about this bill. That's the way parliament works. We understand. But there are some pieces that we agree on'—in this case, it's the small business redundancy exemption? Well done--it's a good piece of legislation in a bad bill. You can then show us that we haven't wasted our time with all of this goodwill by saying, 'Let's pass those good pieces in a bad bill today and get them into law,' and then the urgency that has been expressed by those opposite—in this case, in relation to small business redundancy—can have the effect for the Australian people and look after the workers that most of us, I think all of us, in this place are very keen to look after. Here's the test. Is it about politics? Is it take it or leave it? Is it all or nothing--a bit like some other legislation or referendum that has been put up this year? Is it that no nuance will be entered into? Or is it: okay, this is a good part of a bad bill; let's work together and pass it, get it into law, get those protections working for Australian workers, which is what we're interested in, and then we can have the debate on the other stuff further down the track? It's over to you, government. I wish you well in your deliberations. The Australian people would be really proud of this place if it pulled the bipartisan-agreed parts out, voted on them and got them into the statutes today.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:24</span>):  I rise to support this motion so we can debate and pass this bill and the others excised from the 'closing the loopholes' bill by the Senate. I thank Senators Jacqui Lambie, Tammy Tyrrell and David Pocock for their hard work passing this and three other important pieces of legislation through the Senate, excising them from the omnibus 'closing the loopholes' bill so they can be addressed quickly.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill provides clearer rules around small-business insolvencies, and the bills to follow simplify compensation for first responders, expand the Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency and improve protections for employees subjected to family and domestic violence. These four matters have broad consensus support from unions, business groups, political parties and workers, and essentially these measures are the government's own legislation, own drafting and own words. The government has deemed these issues important enough to include in an omnibus bill, so it would seem pure politicking if the government chooses to vote against passing these bills today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The practice of combining uncontroversial reforms with controversial changes in order to create a wedge doesn't respect the need for parliament to debate changes on their merit. As an Independent, I think very carefully about every vote and I'm willing to explain my position to my constituents. When called to vote on an omnibus bill where I back some but not all changes, I have to either vote against parts that I want to support or vote for parts I don't want to support. By separating uncontroversial parts, such as this bill, I'm able to demonstrate my support for small business, for first responders and for workers who work with dangerous products without signing up to a whole lot of other changes with broad and unknown consequences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The remainder of the 'closing the loopholes' bill needs to be considered further in accordance with parliamentary processes to ensure its consequences are fully understood. It seems like an appropriate decision to debate these parts today and defer the bulk of the 'closing the loopholes' bill until next year, when it can be properly debated. I urge the government and every member of the House to support this motion so we can pass these measures into law as soon as possible.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:27</span>):  I support the opposition's premise that this should be debated now. I'm grateful that the Senate dealt with this last week and got what I'd say are the good parts of the government's bill debated and through. It seems to be a tendency of this government to mix up the good and the bad—to hide away, for instance, when we were dealing with the previous IR bill; that had more rights for union access and the possibility of bringing back the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal. There were good bits wrapped up in that bill as well, and this is the same. I guess it's a way of trying to lever public support for things that may be quite unpalatable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't know how the government is going to vote on this motion or whether we on this side of the chamber will be gagged. But it would be difficult to believe that the government would vote against its own legislation. I see the minister for industrial affairs over there smiling; I suspect that's where we're heading on this one. It would seem inconceivable that, on these four bills that are directly lifted from their omnibus bill, they would come into this chamber and say, 'No, we don't want to do that at all, because it is much more important to keep the sweet bits in the legislation for later on, when we might be dealing with the nasty bits.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These four pieces of legislation stand in their own right. They are about workers' rights. I remember when the bill to put in 10 days leave a year for sufferers of domestic violence came through this place, and we supported that. I supported the legislation. I made the point at the time that I thought it unfair that employers would meet the cost of it and that it should have been a public expense or a broad expense rather than one on individual employers, because I thought it might lead to distortions in the market and decisions on who may or may not get a job. But, as to this legislation, which refers to issues around handling dangerous products or asbestos-like products—we know what those are; they are those beautiful kitchen tops that create dust when people cut them—if it's urgent to do, and I think it probably is urgent to do, or it is urgent to do, we should deal with it now. We don't want to see it put off to next year, the middle of next year or the year after, or maybe the next term of government. If it's important to deal with, and all the industry agrees that it is important to deal with, we should be dealing with it now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, the bills that deal with the first responders—in another sphere, we say, 'We believe you.' Well, apparently, we don't believe first responders, that their stress is caused by the situation that they're put in. We, on this side of the House, agree with the government. So it should be pretty easy to do. We all agree. So let's pass this through the place now and get on with it, because it's quite clear that the rest of the legislation is going to be held up for a while. So let's do the good bits. Let's move on. That goes across all the four tranches here. We've got agreement—we've got agreement between the two major parties; we've got agreement with the crossbenchers. One would think it wouldn't be all that hard to get those bills through the House of Representatives. All we need is the agreement of the government.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:31</span>):  I too rise to speak in favour of the motion moved by the Manager of Opposition Business, to bring on debate immediately on this great opportunity that the parliament has to make an important change, an important reform, by passing the bill which has come back to us from the Senate. If we do pass this motion, and if we do bring on debate immediately, then it's an opportunity for everyone in this chamber to support an important improvement, an enhancement, to the situation of working people in this country. If you're a member of the Labor Party, I would have thought you would welcome the opportunity, particularly if you'd served in this chamber, to vote in favour of legislation—and therefore to vote for this motion to do it immediately—that will create an enhanced entitlement to workers in Australia. That is, after all, what the Labor Party is purportedly all about. We have a situation where, here on the opposition benches, we, indeed, are encouraging a government that is of a party named 'the Labor Party' to take our opportunity by supporting this motion and bringing on debate immediately to do something for working people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What's even more significant is that, if we pass this motion and bring on debate now, we will, indeed, be passing a piece of legislation—we can do it today—that the government has already indicated to be a reform that they support. They have it in another piece of legislation that is still in the Senate. I commend the point made by the Manager of Opposition Business when he anticipated potential arguments for not supporting this motion and not bringing on debate and the passage of this legislation, which has already passed through the Senate, on the basis that the provisions in this legislation are contained in a government bill in the Senate. I think the Senate is well aware of that. I think the Senate, when they passed this bill, did so on the basis that, maybe, the other bill that contains this entitlement enhancement for workers would not be coming back to our chamber any time soon.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would venture why the Senate has seen fit to send us this bill. There are some other bills that will be communicated to us—I anticipate, after we, hopefully, deal with this bill and pass it through this parliament—that are in the same category. They involve issues that are the subject of unanimity in the Senate and this chamber. They are reforms that we can all support, as has been pointed out by other contributors in this debate—that is, the major stakeholders that have been consulted, whether that be on the employee side, the trade union movement side or the employer side. Business groups have welcomed these sorts of reforms. We, in the opposition, are very interested and eager to support some elements of these reforms, which are the ones that are being transmitted back to us from the Senate. By supporting the motion that's before us right now, we can pass this new entitlement to Australian workers immediately.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's very important that this procedural motion is well understood by every member if this does need to go to a division. It probably won't need to, because the workers' party will of course support bringing on a vote to create an enhanced entitlement for Australian workers, and we, through our contributions on this side of the chamber, have indicated that we are very eager to bring on consideration of this bill so that we can support this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would anticipate that if you're in the Labor Party, if you're from a workers' party, you'll vote for workers' rights. Those who sometimes uncharitably cast aspersions on those of us on the coalition benches about our attitude towards supporting working people are saying that we are eager to support this entitlement for workers. We're so eager we want to bring on the opportunity immediately, which is what this motion calls for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I hope we don't need to divide, but, if we do, the very important point is that this question is to bring on an opportunity to immediately pass this through the parliament. This is a bill that's gone through the Senate. If we pass it unamended through the House of Representatives then we can immediately have the parliament create this enhanced entitlement for working Australians. If we divide on this, that means that anyone that votes against it does not want this chamber to take the opportunity to immediately do that. That will be the consequence of anyone not supporting this motion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have yet to be speakers against the motion. Hopefully it is the case that this parliament will welcome the opportunity to immediately address this important reform. It is one that the government say they want to legislate. They have it in a bill that's already been through this chamber and is now sitting in the Senate. The Senate has sent this specific legislative instrument back to us and said, 'When it comes to this particular principle around redundancy entitlements, let's get on with this. We may or may not be happy with some of the things in another bill that's already been through the House and is in the Senate.' That's a matter for the Senate and nothing to do with us. But I take the hint from the Senate that they're sending this bill to us so that we can get on with the opportunity of legislating this important change to improve entitlements for workers that would be impacted from redundancies under the small-business trigger—one that's got complete support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I urge the chamber to support this opportunity by voting for this motion to bring on debate. If there are members that don't like this reform then they shouldn't be frightened of having a debate and making those arguments in the chamber, which we can do forthwith. But we have an opportunity to vote to bring this forward. I urge the chamber to support that opportunity.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:37</span>):  I, too, rise to support this important motion, because there are multiple things that we are seeing happening with this motion. We are seeing another step in the so-called party of the worker walking away from Australian workers. That's what they're doing today. They're making a choice. They had a simple choice today and they had a simple choice last week when the Senate passed this bill: would they support Australian workers or would they play politics with Australian workers? We're not sure what those opposite will do, but I think it's fairly safe to say they'll vote against this motion. That will be disappointing because we, on this side, have sat here for 18 months and heard quote after quote from those opposite about how they're the party of workers, they're here to fight for workers and they care about workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They have also spoken a lot about how important this bill is and how urgent it is. The Leader of the House himself said: </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The people affected have had enough of being told, 'Can we have a delay?' They've had enough of being told, 'Can we just pretend the issue is about something else?' They've had enough of being told, 'Consultation hasn't been good enough,' even though there has been more consultation on this than on any workplace relations bill in years. People have had enough of those excuses …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He also said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Members on the government benches are ready to have this debate. We're ready to have this argument. We're ready to close the loopholes.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They were direct quotes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It appears that there was a little asterisk on 'close those loopholes'; there were only some that they were prepared to close straightaway and there were only some that were urgent. If you work in a small business in Australia, your loophole won't be closed but it could be brought forward and debated right now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's understand, importantly, the environment that we're working in. I've been fortunate to work in and with small businesses throughout my career, and those workers are some of the most vulnerable in our country, because small businesses don't have the cash reserves that large multinationals have and that leaves them exposed. And when small businesses go bankrupt or become insolvent, it is the workers that pay that price.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it's crucial that we do close this gap. That has bipartisan support. But the timing is crucial. As the Manager of Opposition Business said, the timing on supporting workers in small businesses is more important than ever, because we are undergoing a cost-of-living crisis and it is small businesses that are feeling the brunt of that. In fact, insolvencies and bankruptcies are up across the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, while the government want to play politics with this motion and delay to suit their own agenda, the reality is: the delay will cost the Australian people, because businesses will become insolvent in the gap between when this could be passed and when we finally get a resolution on the omnibus bill. More businesses, every day and every week, are becoming insolvent as their costs go up and their sales go down. That's the reality of what we're dealing with, with this delay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can get caught up in the politics of an omnibus bill. It's a pretty standard tactic to put four things which are quite reasonable, and which everyone agrees on, together with controversial measures that need to be worked through. What the Senate has done, to its credit, and what Senators Lambie and Pocock have done, to their credit, is to seek to take the politics out of it and to separate this important initiative, to support those that work in small businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a choice for this government. The rhetoric that they espouse about being the party of the workers and the importance of this legislation will be tested. The minister's own words will be tested. Are they going to continue to play politics, or are they going to work constructively with the opposition? We all sit here in question time and hear the Prime Minister and those opposite talk about how we're not constructive, we're not prepared to work with them and we say 'no' to everything. We're saying 'yes' today to four very important motions in this bill that this government could support. We will see what they say and what they do. Ultimately, they will be judged by their actions. Those opposite sit there and preach about being the party of workers. If they vote against this, we will see their hypocrisy and we will see a Labor Party that has lost its way and is no longer the party of the workers. They'll continue to use those words, but their actions today will define whether they actually are a party that's prepared to support workers in small businesses, if those small businesses become insolvent or bankrupt—as we're seeing happen more, in this economic cost-of-living crisis, with small business, unfortunately, bearing the brunt of the challenges. Time matters, and it's important that this legislation gets through, to support those workers.</span>

He's often said, 'We should cooperate where we can, and we should disagree where we must.' I think this is a perfect opportunity, in this parliament, in this moment, to take those words into account and actually act on this.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am a new member of parliament, and, when I ask people what they think of parliament, they think that this is game-playing. They think that we don't come together and focus on the needs of the Australian people. They think that we come here and focus on our own needs and on the political wins that we can have. I think that's why it is so important that we do debate and pass these bills.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is important because it has a real impact on people's lives, and in very difficult economic times when businesses are starting to fail the protections for people that this particular bill affords are absolutely critical and should be brought in as soon as possible. I don't think anyone in this parliament disagrees that these are protections that are vital and, therefore, we should bring them in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While politics normally plays these omnibus bills—we put every possible thing in to wedge the other side—I genuinely think that's not what the community asks of us. I think the community asks for us to be sensible, to work together where we can, and where we have to absolutely disagree to do that respectfully and make the strong case of why that is not appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Simply, I think that these changes are not controversial, that they would help people right now—that is why they are urgent—and otherwise the broader bill has an uncertain future. We're not going to be dealing with it in the other place until at least February, and there are already a number of bills that have reached that place and gone no further. I think the protections that this bill in particular would afford are really important and we should take action on them now.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:46</span>):  Thank you to colleagues who have contributed to this debate on the amendment. I would like to single out the member for Wentworth. I, too, am a new member, and often people will stop us and say: 'Why do you fight all the time? Why do you disagree? Why do you just yell at each other?' You say, 'Whether it's in a committee or in motions like this, there are opportunities for us to show otherwise,' and this is an opportunity for the government to show otherwise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear often, as a rhetorical device, that we don't want the Americanisation of Australian politics, or people will say, 'That's a Trumpian tactic that you're taking,' or use that as a pejorative. We see it again and again, and it's more often directed at this side of politics. If we're going to reflect on some of the things that are superior in our democracy compared to the United States' democracy, one is avoiding lumping things in omnibus bills. For anyone who's a student of the US Congress, quite often they will have acts that will have had more time spent on studying and writing the headline than they will for the content, many of which will go to thousands of pages. I urge anyone to look at the Inflation Reduction Act. It's a great title; we all think inflation should be reduced—in fact, some think it should be reduced more urgently than others. But, within that, there's an extraordinarily long list of other items that have nothing to do with the title. That's what the government has done here. They have lumped in some items that have broad support, that any reasonable person would agree need to be done, and then built in a legislative straw man.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that a strawman argument is a weak argument. It's an argument that seeks to misrepresent. It builds something up and says, 'Here are the things that reasonable people can agree on that are a part of this bill, and, therefore, in opposing this omnibus bill'—so you can single out the reasonable parts—'I'm going to tear you down for that.' I'm going to tear down the strawman argument.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Strawman arguments are tricks. They're dishonest. They seek to misrepresent what the actual debate is about. And it's not just a debating tool. I know the minister has a very distinguished record as a debater, and I admire his performances here, but, when we come to this place and we seek to practice our democracy, straw men should have no place in this building, in this room, because we should be as legislators able to focus on the specifics of the problem that we're trying to solve and actually address those, agree where we can and disagree where we don't. Again, this was well put by the member for Wentworth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Credit to the Senate, as the Senate has sought to tear down your straw man. They've sought to pull it apart and say, 'Here are the reasonable bits that we can agree on.' You, the government, have said this is urgent, and the member for Casey quoted you. And again, with a great rhetorical flourish, the government came in here and pointed the finger at us and said, 'Are you really going to stand up and say that you disagree with these reasonable things?' No, we're not. We agree with you. We agree on the four parts which have been pulled apart from the straw man.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The one that has come up first is the small business redundancy exemption. This is really important, and it clearly is a loophole that needs to be addressed; we agree with the government. They said it was urgent and that it needs to be brought on. So the question is then put back on them: will you vote against this reasonable proposal? Will you vote against the very thing you said needs to be fixed and should be brought forward now?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We shouldn't have straw man arguments brought before this House. It is a feature of democracy in the United States, and I always think that Australian democracy is far better than any other on earth. So let's maintain the practice we have of having the description of the bill match the content of it and the problem we're trying to solve. This is certainly one of those opportunity.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:50</span>):  I rise in support of this amendment to the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Small Business Redundancy Exemption) Bill 2023. Several of the measures in this lengthy fair work legislation are uncontroversial—indeed, they're to be applauded. But I made it clear to the minister some weeks ago, and repeatedly since, that the uncontroversial elements of the bill should not have been included in what I would describe as portmanteau legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All governments do it and, okay, I'm relatively new here; but I think it's disrespectful to the parliament and that it gets in the way of considered discussion of major policy initiatives and changes. None of us is elected by our communities to waive through really comprehensive changes to legislation without thought and scrutiny. I thank senators Pocock, Lambie and Tyrrell for their efforts to have the uncontroversial and, indeed, I believe, urgent elements of the bill debated separately in this place. This is the crossbench acting in the interests of the entire parliament, and the government should take up the invitation and debate these urgent measures in the House immediately. Those are: the proposal to make it easier for AFP officers, paramedics and firefighters to claim for PTSD; measures to protect victims of domestic violence from being discriminated against in the workplace; and—the aspect in this bill—to protect redundancy payments for workers who have been working for a larger business that has only technically become defined as a small business due to insolvency. And there are also the measures to bring silica in line with asbestos under the Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency. These are all measures that I believe require and deserve implementation without delay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this, I agree wholeheartedly with Senator Jacqui Lambie: if these elements were separated from the bill they could be resolved immediately and without being subject to what would be a lengthy and complex debate, and a Senate inquiry, which would result in an undoubtedly markedly different bill by the time it passed into law. In this, I would again say to the government that chucking everything, including the kitchen sink, into one piece of legislation is not good practice. It's a political wedge approach and a deliberate habit of the major parties which means either voting for a bill that is in some way flawed or against a bill that has its positives. Neither is a great way to do business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government argues that passing these bills before a Senate inquiry reports in February is not good process. There's some irony in that, given that the crossbench raised this exact point with regard to being placed in a position where we would have to debate and vote on a flawed omnibus bill before the inquiry reported. I am in favour of this amendment.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:53</span>):  I rise to support this amendment brought by the Manager of Opposition Business. This amendment proposes that we in this House now debate the private senator's bill, the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Small Business Redundancy Exemption) Bill 2023, which has come down today from the other place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In general, the bill concerns the government's very large omnibus legislation dealing with fair work. The bill that is the subject of this amendment, however, has seen the Senate, very sensibly, extract four elements from the government's very lengthy omnibus legislation and propose that those four pieces be dealt with today. The omnibus legislation, as we know, provides a whole series of controversial measures that the government knew the opposition was never going to support, but wrapped into that are various measures we do support. I commend the motion brought by the Manager of Opposition Business because those four elements that the private senator's bill has sought to extract are four elements that we on this side support. We support this for workers' protection, and in particular we note that small business and the business community generally also supports these proposed amendments. They go to four separate issues: first of all, supporting first responders to cope with PTSD; secondly, changes specifically related to people who are suffering from silica diseases that have been caused in the workplace; thirdly, supporting those in the workplace who have been the victims of domestic violence—these are all very important measures we support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In view of the comments that were made by the minister for industrial relations when this legislation was first brought before the House, I would imagine that those on the government side will also be supporting this motion. They have said over and over again how important it is that workers' rights are protected, and the private senator's bill will, if passed today—and it can be passed today—ensure those workers' rights are protected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we can just go back through a bit of the history of this matter: at the time of introducing the bill, the minister for industrial relations said the House needed to stop delaying because, apparently, we on this side were imperilling the safety of Australian workers. My question is this: will the government today apply that same test? Will it stop imperilling the safety of Australian workers and agree both with this motion and with the legislation? To not support this motion would in fact be a betrayal of Australian workers; that's on the government's and the minister's own test. And it would a betrayal of the very people those opposite claim to always support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Procedurally, this motion is correct. It is entirely appropriate for the House to determine what matters it considers most important to debate and when to debate them. Given the messages from the Senate contain provisions which would inarguably enhance worker's safety, this is an opportunity to immediately pass these commonsense provisions. It doesn't matter there'll be an argument put that these provisions also exist in the government's omnibus Fair Work amendment bill; when the whole bill comes back before the House, those provisions can easily be omitted during the consideration in detail stage, if the government wishes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The House must deal with what is currently before it; that is, the private senator's bill—a private senator's bill that we agree would help Australian workers. The government cannot claim that this motion somehow ambushes it and decreases its time to consider the private senator's bill. These bills aren't a surprise. There's already been a vote on them in the Senate, so the government has, in fact, formed a view on them. I congratulate both Senators Pocock and Lambie on doing the hard work to get these provisions through the Senate, and I note that the government did vote against the passage of those bills when they were in the other place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it might be useful, when we consider what the government is proposing to do today, to look specifically at some of the rhetoric that was expressed when the omnibus legislation first came into this place. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Members on the government benches are ready to have this debate. We're ready to have this argument. We're ready to close the loopholes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, we on this side of the House are today ready to have this debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Assistant Minister for Mental Health and Suicide Prevention said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">That is why I am so pleased to see that, in this proposal, first responders will have better support for mental ill health that has arisen due to their work.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:01</span>):  I rise to support this motion because, if there is the opportunity for the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Small Business Redundancy Exemption) Bill 2023 to be debated, voted on and supported, we could immediately be providing protections for workers with respect to small-business redundancy, so that large employers could not downsize to the small-business threshold of below 15 employees. Without doing that, we are not providing that protection, so really there is a sense of urgency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is about whether we want to do the right thing collectively with what is before us right now or whether we accept the government's position that the bill be in their name entirely, on the assumption that the legislation as a whole that's currently in the other place, is supported. Who knows? We actually could be in a position where that bill in the other place might not be supported and these protections might never be provided. That's what we have to think about at the moment—not about political game playing and who wins, but about exactly what is before us and the merit of what is before us. That is why I support this motion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is important for the government—and incumbent on them—to actually put the needs of these workers first, before their political game playing and before what they see as this whole situation not unfolding according to the political plans they perhaps had. So I'd like all of us in this chamber to consider supporting this motion. Let's debate this now. Let's put the people of Australia first, including the people who would be affected by this redundancy measure and the people who are already being affected by this redundancy measure. Let's think of them and put their protections before the politics of this place. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can do better. I would urge the government to reconsider their position and to support this motion. Let's urgently debate this piece of legislation that has come down from the other place, because it is a matter of urgency. We have four bills before us today. Each of them include measures that are not contentious and are broadly supported right across the parliament. Let's do the right thing, let's do the commonsense thing and let's all come together for the people of Australia ahead of political pointscoring and political game playing.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:04</span>):  As you know, Mr Speaker, I've been absent from the parliament for the last six weeks because I've been in the UN. I was relishing the opportunity to come and speak on this issue because it is something that is very near and dear to my heart. I thank the Manager of Opposition Business for bringing this very important amendment to this chamber. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll talk a little bit about the building industry in a moment, but before I do that I need to say that my heart sank when the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations just left the chamber. My heart sank because I was thinking, 'There are a lot of things I disagree with him on, but at least he's in here listening to the arguments.' He's back—excellent. I am very heartened by that. Minister, I hope you don't leave again, because I really want you to listen to this.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The building industry is the second-largest employer in the country. As some of my colleagues in this chamber will know, it is a sector that I have been involved with for 35 years. I started my working life as an apprentice carpenter. I then became a builder. I then went back to school and did a law degree and practised in construction law for 16 years. I have had 35 years in the building industry. It has been very good to me and it has been very good to many Australians, but the building industry is going through a very difficult time right now. If the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Small Business Redundancy Exemption) Bill 2023 does not pass today, it will make life even more difficult for the hundreds of thousands of people who are working in the building industry. </span>

                    </a>  It is in fact a very large part of the economy. It represents some 10.4 per cent of our GDP. Because I used to be on the tools myself I know that many people in the building industry around the country will be listening to parliament right now because they are good, decent citizens who want to take an active role in our democracy and really enjoy listening to parliament. They're going to be wondering what this is all about. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government introduced the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Closing Loopholes) Bill 2023. It's an omnibus bill. There are a lot of things in it that we disagree with. The Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Small Business Redundancy Exemption) Bill 2023 has come to this chamber from the Senate. To their credit, Senators David Pocock and Lambie have effectively hived out the less contentious issues. One of them is the small business redundancy exemption. We on this side of the House think it's really important—and I would have thought that those on the other side of the House think it's really important too, because it is their bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those listening at home or at work, the bill we are dealing with today is a private senator's bill that ensures that employees do not miss out on redundancy payments merely because their employer became a small business as a result of bankruptcy or insolvency. I don't in any way seek to take away from the gravity or importance of this issue, but it reminds me of the building industry joke: 'How do you make a small fortune out of the building industry? You start with a big company.' That's the reality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many pressures on the building industry right now that building companies are closing down left, right and centre. There are many pressures being brought to bear by the cost of living that this government has brought on: trades are in short supply; materials are incredibly expensive; the price of steel, concrete and timber has gone through the roof; and, sadly, more than two construction businesses in this country are failing every week. That is having a significant impact, obviously, upon their employees. Some businesses are small, but others are very large, and the carnage being reaped upon construction sector workers across this country is very, very significant.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would have thought that, for a party that prides itself on allegedly being the party for the workers, it would have come in here today and said: 'Fair go; no worries. These are relatively uncontentious provisions. They're from our bill. We'll support them.' To date, to be fair, we don't know how the government is going to deal with this. Do you know what? I have this sneaking suspicion that they're not going to support it. It would be a source of great shame not just for the minister but for all those members opposite who pride themselves allegedly on being the party for the workers--and, here we are, the crossbench and the opposition in the Senate support it, and we support the extraction of the less contentious issues. But I want to focus on the small business redundancy exemption. Hopefully, with a bit of luck, I'll have an opportunity to talk later today about the other three bills.</span>

                    </a>  I appreciate that, Minister. If this bill passes today, it will provide assistance to everyday working Australians, not just in the construction sector but particularly in the construction sector where people are hurting badly. They're not just hurting because businesses are failing. They're hurting because electricity has gone through the roof. They're hurting because rent has gone through the roof. Everything is up. The reality is that businesses are regrettably, very sadly, falling over, and none so more than in the construction sector. So I call upon the minister to reach deep, deep into his soul and heart and try and convince his colleagues, none of whom have spoken on this today—not one has spoken on this today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister can be very eloquent. Hopefully, I will get a chance to repeat his words to him very shortly. He can be very eloquent. I know that he can bring his colleagues around to support this bill because I know that in his heart of hearts, however hard it is to reach down there, he does believe in the importance of looking after workers and that this bill will provide assistance where, if it doesn't pass, it may not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that we can do this today. My understanding is that, if we don't do this today, we're talking about next year at the earliest. What about all of those businesses that are failing between now and next year? What about all of those employees who could potentially miss out on redundancy payments? It makes absolutely no sense for the government to stand on—I don't know what they're standing on on this issue, to be quite honest—other than politics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I call upon the minister, I call upon the prime minister and I call on every single member opposite: don't play politics with this issue. Remember the workers and remember your union members who will ultimately be impacted. They will suffer if you don't agree to this today. It's very simple. There's no contention here. You supported these provisions. You introduced these provisions. You should support them today to provide assistance to everyday working Australians today.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282306" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PEARCE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:14</span>):  I am honoured today that I am able to speak on the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Small Business Redundancy Exemption) Bill 2023. It means a lot to the people I represent within the great electorate of Braddon in the north-west, on the west coast and on King Island in Tasmania. In doing so, I also bring to the floor 18 to 20 years of experience as an agricultural contractor. I employed at one time up to 28 employees, some of whom were contractors themselves in their own right. The reason we did that was to allow them flexibility and the ability to operate within the legislation that existed. They could choose their own path forward. They could pick and choose which direction they wanted to take their own businesses. They could allow their families to have flexibility as far as lifestyle choices were concerned. They could take a week off and take the family camping, fishing or whatever great pursuit they wanted to do in the great state of Tasmania. It allowed them the flexibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing it did was allow them flexibility around capital. When you're starting out in a contracting business, there are many overheads that need to be paid for. That all requires money, and normally it requires debt. It's a hell of a risk when a young person or a young couple start a business in the construction industry or in the agricultural sector. They have to take a path on which they have never trodden before. It's the unknown in a lot of cases. At least having flexibility, the ability to control one's own destiny, allows them the confidence that they need to, firstly, go about taking up that new pursuit. Secondly, once you start borrowing capital, again you are at the mercy of your own work ethic when it comes to paying that debt back. Debt for me as a small-business operator was like a noose around my neck. I could never really breathe easily until that debt was paid off. It's those contractors, it is those mum and dad businesses, that I'm talking about today. I do so, as I said, from experience.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to this amendment in this particular bill, as far as I'm concerned, it's a no-brainer. I recently visited the Master Builders Association in a place called Devonport on the north-west coast. They told me with great vengeance and furious anger how much disappointment they had about your bill, Minister. I'm sorry to bring that terrible news from Tasmania, but they are not fans. The pertinent point they had on this particular part of the legislation is that unscrupulous operators could manipulate the legislation in order to rip workers off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me talk to you about that for a second. Let me talk to you about the wrong impression that some people, particularly on the other side, have in relation to employers, people who employ people. I can tell you from experience that most of the people that I represent fit into this category. They would give their right arm and their right leg for their employees. I know in my particular case I would treat them like my own children. I knew full well that, if I didn't, I wouldn't have a business. I knew that the money that I paid them each week would go a lot further if they were willing to do their utmost for me. It was a mutual arrangement. At Christmas time, I used to kill a cow and cut into all the cuts, and I would give that to the families. They would put those in their freezers and that would feed some of those families for most of the year. I didn't charge them for that. I could have bought them a gold watch or given them $1,000, but where would that have gone? Instead, I decided to do something that looked after their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can remember lending my employees money to buy their first homes, and they could pay me back whenever they liked. I remember one particular fellow had trouble with his daughter, who had a peculiar illness that needed specialist work in Melbourne on the mainland. I paid for that. I just said to that young bloke, 'You can pay me back when you get a chance, tiger.' And he certainly did. He was with me until the time I sold that particular business. The point I'm making, and the reason I'm telling you these stories, is that 99.9 per cent of our employers out there care very deeply about their people. I want to make that very clear here today. This particular amendment goes to augmenting, supporting and reinforcing that so that unscrupulous operators, as I've said previously, don't have the opportunity to rip off their workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the small-business capital that is the north-west coast of Tasmania—and, just on that, the way Tasmania works is that, geographically, it's shaped like a funnel. The money is earned up the top in places like Bass and Braddon, and then it trickles down south and ends up in Hobart. Who knows what they do with it down there! But, nevertheless, the north-west, the west coast and King Island are the engine room of our small-business economy. These aren't big businesses, they're small- to medium-sized businesses—mum-and-dad businesses. They're sole traders and partnerships; people who get in and have a go. The point I'm making about difficult parts of legislation, when something like an omnibus bill turns into legislation, is from my own particular case. Normally, it's my wife who would look after that, who would sort through that legislation and do all the paperwork while I was busy in the truck or the tractor, or doing something manual. However, when my wife has to do that then that's 50 per cent of the business taking it's eyes off the road; 50 per cent of the business stops being effective and now has to concentrate on copious amounts of litigious protocol just to go about the business and do the job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that weighs on the hearts and minds of my small-business operators is the punitive arrangements if you make a mistake. Invariably, that's what happens in small business: mistakes happen. There may be a number filled in the wrong column or an error that's made. The mens rea—the criminal intent—isn't necessarily there. So we need to have provisions within this legislation and this compliance which allow for mistakes to happen. I would rather an outcome-driven philosophy where we tell people how they can do something rather than tell them what they can't do. This is exactly where we're coming from here with this particular amendment. It's exactly the premise and rationale we had when we put this up: that we look after our small-business operators—we give them confidence and we allow them the flexibility they need to go about their business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, what those opposite need to understand—what everybody in this place needs to understand—is that business is tough. We can start talking about the cost of living, but it isn't just that; it's the cost of doing business as well. Everything small-business operators touch, everything they're involved in, has gone up exponentially when it comes to the cost of living and inflationary pressures. We can talk about the cost of energy or the cost of fuel, or we can talk about primary production costs that are passed down through the supply chain to the end user. Or we can talk about the isolated nature of Tasmania—the fact that it's an island some nautical miles south of the mainland, requiring extensive shipping costs in order to get freight there and to get product from the farms and primary production regions onto the mainland itself. It's an expensive place to do business.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that happens, particularly in my region, is that there aren't necessarily the support mechanisms for contractors and small-business owners. They can't simply go to a lobby group, a support mechanism or someone who looks after their particular industry because they don't have the scale and critical mass necessary to have that support measure. Often, they're by themselves and don't have that support. As far as I'm concerned, that's what my job is. I'm there to support them. I'm the bloke who they ring and who they trust. And they've rung me and told me—and they've looked in my eye and said—that they don't like this bill, particularly this part of this bill, and that this amendment will certainly go a long way to remedy that. It will support our workers and put the focus back onto the workers, where it really should be.</span>

I see the minister opposite in the House. It's pleasing to see that the minister has stayed in for the duration of this debate, so I thank him for that.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think this motion is a good test for the government. We have seen the crossbench and the coalition support the private senators' motion by Senators Pocock and Lambie in the Senate last week to split out the noncontentious components of an omnibus bill which has plenty in it that scares many in the business community. I think it's incumbent on us in this place, as I think the member for Warringah outlined in her contribution, to work together and identify those bits, in a very, very large and ominous piece of legislation, that have support in our community.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This particular portion of the bill, the small business redundancy exemption portion, is exactly the piece of legislation that we, right across this chamber, should agree on and support, given that those opposite, as other contributions to this debate have outlined, are supposedly the party for the worker. This particular piece of the omnibus bill seeks to prevent large businesses from using entering administration to avoid paying redundancy payments to their employees. I don't see any reason why the government would oppose this private senators' motion and not support it, given that their stated aim is to represent employees right across our great country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On that basis, I support the amendment by the Manager of Opposition Business to bring this particular bill on for debate immediately, because we've heard those opposite, in various comments, outline numerous times how important it is that this legislation get through this parliament. Here is an opportunity for the parliament to work on a bipartisan basis to support a key piece of the legislation, to ensure that one of those loopholes that this bill is supposedly seeking to close is closed. The coalition stands here fully in support of achieving that objective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we look at the importance of this piece of the bill, we know that we have seen, as the member for Fisher has rightly pointed out, large businesses enter into administration in the building industry. I saw that with my father, who was a ceramic tiler, over many years. It's not the first time it's happened. It's not the contractors of these businesses who'll miss out—well, they will miss out by these businesses going into administration, but, importantly, this piece of legislation refers to the employees in those businesses who might miss out on their redundancy entitlements as a result of that business entering into administration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just in the building sector we see this; we see it across other parts of the economy as well. We see medium to large businesses, that are presently not classified as small businesses, enter into administration and fall below that threshold and then use those provisions to avoid paying their due entitlement. It's one of the bits of the legislation that closes a good loophole to close. I would ask the government, in the spirit of bipartisanship—and the manager of government business frequently says that we are the 'no-alition'. Well, we're being the 'yes-alition' in this case, supporting a piece of government legislation to get it through the House and protect the—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wright</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  Labor are desperately failing the Australian public. Since the election, we've heard continuous promise after promise that it was going to be easier under Labor. I say that it's getting harder and harder. Every day it's harder. Electricity prices are up 18 per cent. Families right across the electorate of Wright are telling me how difficult it is to deal with the cost-of-living pressures. Electricity prices are up 18 per cent, and that flows through to our food producers. The largest contributor to GDP in my electorate is agriculture; we produce vegetables. When electricity prices are up, costs for the packing houses, the produce houses, go up, and those have to be passed on to mums and dads, and the Australian public, when they buy products at the grocery store.</span>

It never came, and that's why Labor is failing our public. We've seen an eight per cent increase in the price of food, again, as a result of the extra cost of goods. We've seen the 12 interest rate rises and inflation is out of control. There are many things that we can do with the fiscal levers, but this government aren't doing them. They're continuing to pump in funds after funds. The Labor government are failing the Australian people.</span>

That's what Diwali is about. It's a week-long festival of light that's one of the most important Hindu festivals. The Indian Society of WA, ISWA, held Diwali Mela 2023 on the stunning foreshores of the Swan River in the electorate of Perth. What an amazing festival ISWA threw: over 30,000 people came together and, boy, do Perth's Indians know how to throw a party! ISWA had to take it to a new whole level by having a Bollywood celebrity dancer-singer, and choreographer Terence Lewis, come. When Terence learned that the ISWA president needed a couple of tips on dance moves, he gave Satish and the dignitaries an impromptu dance lesson on stage. I am glad that I had my dancing shoes on!</span>

Congratulations to ISWA and all the volunteers, and thanks to the WA Cook Labor government and the City of Perth for their support. It was really special that I got to share this special festival with my mother. It was a stunning showcase of Indian culture and diversity on the shores of the Swan River. Thank you for making me proud of my Indian heritage and proud to be part of such a great community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:33</span>):  The Indo Pacific 2023 International Maritime Exposition was held in Sydney last week, the biggest defence industry gathering in the southern hemisphere. Despite an abundance of cutting-edge intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance providers, no-one could find the Labor defence industry minister. He managed to evade every radar, every sonar and every eyeball present at the conference. The minister even evaded detection at a packed-out defence industry gathering, and was declared missing in action until he turned on his social media beacon in the Cook Islands. Search and rescue was stood down, and we were relieved to find him festooned with flowers and hanging with the Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sure, he's also the Minister for International Development and the Pacific, but that doesn't mean he can be a part-time defence industry minister. The question remains: where is the minister? Does he care about Australia's industrial base? Does he care about the hardworking small and medium businesses innovating to protect our country? The message from the exposition floor was clear and consistent, and that was that the Albanese government has failed Australian defence industry. We are still waiting for Labor's response to the surface fleet review, which has resulted in delays and uncertainty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor government has to resolve a paradox at the heart of their defence policy. They keep saying that Australia is facing the most dangerous circumstances since the end of the Second World War, yet they're doing nothing about it. The good news is that the coalition is committed to a strong ADF and a strong industrial base.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  I stand before you today with a heart full of gratitude and hope, having had the privilege of being a guest of my local Mount Pleasant Baptist Church for the recent WA Governor's Prayer Breakfast. This event was not just a gathering of individuals of Christian faith. It was a profound experience that really touched me. On that day I walked into a room filled with people from diverse backgrounds, coming together with a common goal: to reflect, pray and share in the spirit of hope and faith. It was the first thing on my agenda, having flown back from sitting in parliament only the night before. It is always heartwarming for me to attend events with my fellow Christian brothers and sisters, to share in their belief, welcoming me in, even though I am a Buddhist.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Governor's Prayer Breakfast was a testament to the power of togetherness and really highlighted the importance of prayers and spiritual reflection. The speakers were so inspiring. Their stories of faith and resilience and the impact of prayer on their lives was so deep. They reminded us that, in the face of adversity, one's faith and prayer can be a source of strength and comfort.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  Last Saturday—on Remembrance Day, where there was a service at Parndana—saw the wrapping up of our spring South Australian Country Shows season. In total, seven country shows were held in Mayo, as well as two fairs—the Houghton fair and the Meadows fair. I thought I would quickly run through where those shows were: Yankalilla, Strathalbyn, Port Elliot, Kingscote, Callington, Uraidla and Parndana.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our shows are where we showcase what we make. They are regional showcases of what we grow. It's our produce and our flowers. It's our poultry, our sheep shearing and our cattle. They're all on display. It's what we make: our sewing; our handicrafts. It's wonderful to see so many of those skills, such as lace-making, on show for all to enjoy. Then there's what we bake—our cakes and our biscuits. Honestly, in Mayo, we grow everything, we make everything and we bake everything.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's best about our country shows is that families come out and they see old friends, and the little children are all running around in a wonderful safe space. Everyone looks out for each other.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I congratulate all the volunteers right across my electorate—everyone who was involved in our country shows and our two fairs, at Houghton and at Meadows, where I again milked a cow. I've yet to win a ribbon! But it's a fantastic day. Thank you all.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  Twelve months ago, on 14 November 2022, torrents of water tragically tore through the usually quiet country communities of Eugowra, Molong, Canowindra, Cudal, Manildra and Wellington, causing complete and utter destruction and devastation. In Eugowra, over 90 per cent of homes were destroyed or damaged. Many thought the town would cease to exist, but the Eugowra spirit shone through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This time tomorrow, I'll be back on the ground with residents to mark the anniversary of this tragedy. It will be a time of sad and solemn reflection. The pain of that day is still very real and very raw for our residents. Many are still in pods or caravans, and businesses are still closed amid the widespread insurance knockbacks. For the last 12 months I've been fighting for proper disaster funding for our residents, and I'm both pleased and relieved that both the state and federal governments have finally agreed to a combined $100 million for our communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this tragic anniversary, I would like to sincerely thank and acknowledge all the first responders, the emergency services personnel and the many, many truly heroic community members who did so much to save so many on that awful day. Our hearts and deepest sympathies go out to the friends, family and loved ones of Dianne Smith and Les Vugec, who tragically lost their lives in this disaster. They were both greatly loved and are greatly missed. They will never be forgotten. Tomorrow the thoughts of our nation will be with Eugowra and the communities of the Central West.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:41</span>):  Recently I had the privilege of joining students, educators and parishioners of St Charles Catholic School in Ryde to celebrate a remarkable milestone: 165 years of education at St Charles Ryde. The day began with a mass led by Father Greg Morgan. We spoke about the church's gratitude for education, faith and community that St Charles has provided for so long. The atmosphere was charged with the warmth of Thanksgiving, representing a living testament to the spirit that has sustained St Charles Catholic School for 165 years. The school has provided education to so many local kids and families, and, through its parish, has also served our community beyond the classroom. They are a parish and a school that are intertwined with Bennelong, with plenty of outreach, community engagement and the widely popular annual St Charles school fete.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Amidst the celebration, there was a touching moment as Father Greg acknowledged the impending retirement of an important man. Principal Peter Watkins, an experienced school educator and leader, has devoted 13 years of service to the school and its community. His impact has been profound, leaving a mark on the lives of countless students, colleagues and the wider community. The legacy he leaves behind will undoubtedly endure—a testament to his dedication to the principles of Catholic education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Congratulations to St Charles and to Principal Watkins for reaching these amazing milestones. Here's to another 165 years of education, faith and service.</span>

There have been multiple accidents at this intersection since I last raised this issue over two months ago in this place to improve road safety for local residents. According to the RAC this is one of the most hazardous intersections in WA, with at least 33 traffic crashes and countless near misses at this intersection.</span>

Last week I took the shadow assistant minister for infrastructure and transport, Tony Pasin, the member for Barker, to see this dangerous intersection firsthand. Our community should not be forced to go out of our way to avoid this notorious black spot which has needed attention for many years.</span>

This report and the government's ridiculous support of it effectively kills off Inland Rail in Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a way to save it: pause Inland Rail at Toowoomba. We sit at the junction of the Gore, Warrego and New England highways, intersecting with the western rail line and right next door to Wellcamp Airport, where freight is already being delivered directly into Asia. This would save the project somewhere around $9 billion while ensuring the benefits of Inland Rail are brought into Queensland. This simple solution requires no new engineering or business cases; it simply makes sense.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:47</span>):  We have done it again. I've stood here on many occasions banging the drum for Hunter wineries being the best in the world, and the recent New South Wales Wine Awards showed why. Hunter wines took out 36 gold and eight top gold medals, along with the prestigious New South Wales Governor's trophy for 2023 best wine in show. This highlights the quality and craftsmanship of our local wineries, with First Creek Wines 2022 Single Vineyard Wills Hill Road Chardonnay earning best chardonnay and best white wine in the show, as well as the New South Wales Governor's 2023 best-in-show trophy. This is a remarkable achievement. Congratulations to Brokenwood Wines for securing the gold medal for the best semillon, with the 2017 ILR Reserve Semillon 100, and to Bimbadgen for the gold medal in the best white single varietal category for the 2023 Growers Vermentino. Well done to Ash and Lauren from Horner Wines for clinching the gold medal for best organic wine with the 2022 Reserve Shiraz Marsanne, which also won gold medal for best red blend. Tulloch Wines' 2022 Cellar Door Release cab sav earned the gold medal for the best cab sav, adding another layer of excellence to the Hunter's achievements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Hunter Valley continues to shine on the global wine stage, and these accolades are well deserved. Cheers to the winemakers, the vineyard managers and everyone involved in making these exceptional wines possible.</span>

The government are about to hit 200 days in their infrastructure review. They have developed a specialty: opening projects that they haven't funded from programs that they have discontinued. They're buying unknown senators a new Akubra and a pair of RMs and sending them out to open projects, when they have no concept of what the project is actually about.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Next Saturday I'm going to a very important project under the Building Better Regions Fund, where it's been made very clear that I'm to take no part. After all, I was only the local member that fought for this project! With regard to the Inland Rail, I think the only reason we didn't get a senator to the opening of the last section of that is that Google Maps probably didn't show where North Star was and they couldn't find where this vital piece of infrastructure was built.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has got to start building. I believe they must think they're going to be a one-term government, because what are they going to open in their second term when they've built nothing in their first term? The only thing that's giving them oxygen at the moment is opening projects that were developed and funded by the previous government. They need to get on with it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  I rise to acknowledge Portia Roberts, a young constituent in my electorate who has recently competed at the 16th International Dragon Boat Federation's World Dragon Boat Racing Championships in Pattaya, Thailand. At age 11, Portia would often watch her parents and grandparents, who were dedicated dragon boat racers, train from the shoreline in Saratoga on the New South Wales Central Coast. Portia soon developed her own passion for dragon boat racing and, when she reached the age of 12, joined the Deepwater Dragon Boat Club in Saratoga, becoming its first junior paddler.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the years went on, Portia's training continued. Portia's potential was realised by her coach, Kathy Cummings. Kathy contacted the coach of the Sydney Zodiacs, Australia's national and state champions, who invited Portia to make the move to join the Sydney Zodiacs in 2022. Portia says that to dragon boat is one of the best decisions she's ever made, and she maintains a rigorous training schedule to ensure she is in the best shape to compete.</span>

Portia raced in the under-18s division and displayed tremendous effort in her category. I wish to congratulate Portia on all of her sporting success and for her achievements at the recent world championships. Keep going, Portia!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mitchell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  I rise again to call out the terrible incidents we've seen in Australia since we last met in relation to the rise of anti-Semitic activity on our streets. Sadly, in Caulfield we've seen unacceptable violence with people targeting people on the basis of their race or religion and, again, in my opinion, an inadequate response from the authorities. When I spoke on this last, I pointed to the inadequate police response in Sydney on the steps of the Opera House, and I again call on the authorities, with all of the power, with all of the legislation, with all of the money they're given, to do their jobs to protect minorities in Australia from acts of intimidation and violence specifically targeted at them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I point out to the government again that the response of the foreign minister, Penny Wong, was wholly inadequate in this regard in calling for a ceasefire. I point the foreign minister to the European Union, where Josep Borrell Fontelles, who of course is the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, recently issued a statement. In that statement calling for a ceasefire and the ceasing of hostilities, he pointed out that they, the EU, call on Hamas to immediately and unconditionally release all hostages, condemn the use of hospitals and civilians as human shields by Hamas and that civilians must be allowed to leave the combat zone. Hostilities are severely impacting hospitals and civilians. I would point the foreign minister to this statement, because that is the appropriate statement to issue on behalf of Australia—not that we're calling for a ceasefire but that we are calling for all of this to be addressed, including Hamas terrorism and the taking of civilians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  On Saturday I marked Remembrance Day at the Sunshine RSL, alongside returned soldiers, members and volunteers. While the occasion was about acknowledging past sacrifices, in an increasingly uncertain global environment our armed forces continue to play a significant role in peacekeeping and other capacities. Occasions like Remembrance Day also bring into sharp relief the vital welfare support that our RSL branches provide to our returned veterans, so I would like to acknowledge the extraordinary voluntary contribution of Lesley Twidle, who has served as secretary of the Sunshine RSL for more than 16 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lesley and her team organise the ANZAC Day community commemoration march and the ANZAC Day dawn service and breakfast, among many other events every year. Lesley also coordinates the welfare program, including fundraising for ANZAC Day and Remembrance Day, with up to $40,000 raised. She also coordinates the weekly Sunshine Harvester Day Club, which is a lifeline for many, particularly the surviving partners of returned soldiers. The meals, entertainment, trivia events and other social activities are a real highlight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For 15 years Lesley also spent one night a week volunteering with St Vincent de Paul's soup kitchen. In recognition of her work, Lesley was recently honoured with a Senior Achievement Award in last month's Victorian Senior of the Year Awards and was given her award directly by the Governor of Victoria. A teacher for 35 years, Lesley began volunteering with the RSL as soon as she retired from the classroom. Lesley, thank you for your service.</span>

Well done team members Riley Flood, Louis Ashby, Zane Jones, Yavita Waiko, Clancy Dunne, Sean Thorneycroft, Alex Robinson, Lachlan Mallet, Rigby O'Meara, Logan Connolly, James Cremona and Mitchell Mayes.

Riley overcame a broken collarbone and mechanical hurdles to win the Dungog event in the Hunter. He started riding before he turned two and spent his youth on dirt bikes on family farms at Coraki and Tunglebung. I'm sure Riley's father, Matt; mother, Angela; and brother, Cody; are very proud of his win at the national event.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  Brown Hill Creek is a particularly beautiful part of Boothby. It runs through the foothills and out across the Adelaide Plains. If you visited now, you'd see a very small trickle of water, but that creek is the sixth most likely catchment to flood in all of the country. In a one-in-100-years flood it would take out parts of the CBD, Ashford Hospital, Adelaide Airport and the interstate train lines, as well as many homes. Brown Hill Keswick Creek Stormwater Management Authority is working towards flood mitigation along the entire catchment. I'm very pleased that the Albanese government has provided $5 million to progress the next pieces of work. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was recently at Brown Hill Creek for the opening of the last tranche of works. This replaced woody weeds with bank-stabilising native plants and shored up the bank around a very significant tree. This tree is estimated to be over 450 years old and is known locally as the Kaurna shelter tree. It was wonderful to see Kaurna elders, including Aunty Lynette Crocker; Allan Sumner, the CEO of Kaurna Yerta Corporation; artist Brad Darkson; and Aunty Elaine Magias; as well as students from Urrbrae Agricultural High School, Mitcham Primary School, Scotch College, Mercedes College, Mitcham Girls High School and St Joseph's Primary School, who all pitched in to achieve the works. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a really special place in Boothby. It's a place where many of our community go. It's a place where the Kaurna people have been for many years. It's lovely to see it being restored so well.</span>

I had the privilege of being able to bridge the gap between their classroom and Parliament House. The bright and engaged students spoke with me about how Parliament House is set up and they identified the differences between the House of Representatives and the Senate, how a bill is passed and some of the political differences within our major parties represented in this House.</span>

The next generation, sitting in our classrooms and in the gallery here today, are our leaders of tomorrow. In a time when there is a strong woke agenda being pushed through our educational institutions it's our responsibility to ensure our kids are inspired to not just follow the crowd but to be informed and engage with our political dialogue. Radical views enshrined into our kids through the interference of the extreme left and the Greens party narrative celebrating identity and woke politics must be exposed for the dangerous and divisive views they are. There is no place for this in our educational system. It has never been more important to provide education and insight into the responsibility our young generation have for our country moving forward. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:59</span>):  The Prime Minister went to the election last year saying that we would prioritise TAFE and that we would value skills, because he understands that when we have skill shortages we don't just backfill with temporary overseas labour. We seize the opportunity to train our young people, and retrain and value our workers, to create the new well-paid jobs of the future. His leadership and his vision for TAFE landed an historic $12 billion National Skills Agreement that will translate to $1.2 billion in Western Australia alone. Alongside our commitment to fee-free TAFE, the government is seriously changing lives. Together, we went and met with students studying Certificate IV in Electronics and Communications. Until our introduction of fee-free TAFE, there were only seven students studying this course. Was it because they were not interested? Absolutely not. It was because it was unaffordable at $3,700. Today, 85 students are studying this course. An increase from 18,000 to 34,000 students across Western Australia are studying fee-free TAFE because it's affordable now. It's free. It's accessible. They want to learn. They want to upskill and to have the jobs of the future. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the House commemorate the fifth anniversary of the national apology to victims and survivors of institutional child sexual abuse. </span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tomorrow is National Survivors' Day, when we recognise and commemorate the courage of survivors of sexual assault and institutional abuse, their supporters, and whistleblowers across Australia. So it is especially fitting that today we mark the anniversary of a major turning point in their journey: the National Apology to Victims and Survivors of Institutional Child Sexual Abuse. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again, I pay tribute to the courage and compassion of Prime Minister Julia Gillard in making the royal commission possible. As great as her opponents' determination was, hers was even greater. What the royal commission achieved will be forever to her credit. The member for Cook delivered the apology as Prime Minister, and I thank him for his important and powerful words that day. As he said in here, half a decade ago, 'Today, as a nation, we confront our failure to listen, to believe and to provide justice.' This was a turning point, and, as we listened to the speeches that day, here and across the nation, we heard the member for Maribyrnong say 10 of the most important words to be spoken in this place: 'We hear you now. We believe you. Australia believes you.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Amid everything that was said during the apology, that was the beating heart of it—hearing and believing, at last. Addressed to the Australians who so badly needed to hear them, those 10 words began the easing of so many burdens: the burden of betrayal, the burden of abuse and the burden of an indifferent world, which so many carried for a lifetime. Far too often, they carried it to the very end. So we keep repeating the words like a heartbeat: 'We hear you. We believe you. Australia believes you.' With those words, this parliament apologised for all the years when we, as a nation, couldn't bring ourselves to hear and when we chose not to believe. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have done away with metaphors of darkness because much of what was inflicted on so many children, in the very places they should have been safe, didn't hide in the shadows. It needed only silence to exist and to continue: the silence of those too afraid to speak and the silence created when voices are ignored or disbelieved. This was laid bare in testimony after testimony to the royal commission. We feel nothing but awe for the courage of those who were able to tell their story and respect for those who could not. On the day of the apology, the then Labor leader the member for Maribyrnong said this to the survivors and the victims:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We do this because it is right, because it is overdue, because Australians must know and face up to the truth about our past. But, above all, we do this because of you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the families and friends of those who hadn't lived to hear it, it was a day of poignancy, yet it was also a day of catharsis, a day when the confusion and shame that had clouded so many lives began to lift. It ended a long chapter, but it also began a fresh one, and, importantly, the parliament was united on that day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last month was the fifth anniversary of the foundation of the Australian Centre To Counter Child Exploitation. Since its launch, the AFP has charged 877 alleged offenders with more than 7,000 child abuse offences. Think about that—7,000! This year also marks the fifth year of operation for the National Office for Child Safety. Recommended by the royal commission, it is working across the Commonwealth states and governments and the community in a coordinated approach to prevent child sexual abuse and support and empower survivors. All Australian governments remain committed to delivering the National Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Child Sexual Abuse 2021-2030, which responds to the approximately 100 royal commission recommendations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In June, the National Centre for Action on Child Sexual Abuse launched its five-year strategic plan, Here for Change, establishing a map for the national centre's work over its first five years and its vision for longer term, generational change. In September, the Attorney-General launched minimum practice standards for specialist and community support services responding to child sexual abuse and last month saw the launch of One Talk at a Time, the national awareness raising and behavioural change campaign on child sexual abuse. The government is reviewing the child sexual abuse offences in the Commonwealth Criminal Code to ensure Australia's legislative framework keeps pace with the evolving threat landscape and maintains our ability to disrupt, prevent, investigate and prosecute these serious crimes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year, the landmark Australian child maltreatment study was published. It is a significant contribution to our understanding of the prevalence and impact of child abuse and neglect in Australia. Beyond our domestic response, the government supports global efforts to fight the threat of online child sexual exploitation and abuse. This year, President Biden of the United States and I announced the establishment of the Australia-United States Joint Council on Combating Online Child Sexual Exploitation, and, later this month, the Attorney-General will host a ministerial forum on child safety to bolster national child safety reforms, strengthen existing frameworks and improve how states and territories and organisations work together to better meet the needs of children and young people and their families and carers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Redress Scheme remains an avenue for survivors to seek and receive recognition for abuse suffered and for institutions and governments to be held accountable for that. This week we are bringing legislation before the parliament to improve access to the scheme and implementing the recommendations of the second-year review. There is a long way to go, but, on behalf of this parliament, I say to the survivors and the victims that together we will continue writing that new chapter—a new chapter that began when your courage finally made Australia listen and broke the silence forever.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dickson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:08</span>):  I thank the Prime Minister for his heartfelt words and join with him to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the national apology to victims and survivors of institutional child sexual abuse. It's hard to believe that, as of 22 October, five years had passed since Prime Minister Morrison delivered the national apology. It's hard to believe that, as of 15 December, six years will have passed since the royal commission presented its final report to the Governor-General. To revisit the report today to again read the personal stories and impacts on victims and their families is no less breathtaking than it was when it was first published.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In volume 13, for example, there is Amelia's story. She recounted her experience as an 11-year-old primary school student in the 1970s. Amelia's deputy principal had singled out her and four female pupils who were her friends. He promised to make them prefects when they reached year 6 provided they stay after class and read aloud to him. The royal commission report says that he stood up and walked over to Amelia, put his hand under her skirt and commanded her to open her legs. The report goes on to say that Amelia and the other girls were abused once a week for one year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have omitted the more confronting parts of that account, but, frankly, we only do a service to perpetrators of this evil crime if we don't speak frankly about the depravity of their actions. It's an uncomfortable subject, and it's difficult to talk about, but we must be upfront, frank and open. This is the advice of many child protection advocates, including the Morcombe foundation. We have to have that conversation. It's a crime type that we don't see on television screens of a night-time. We don't see the CCTV footage from a stolen vehicle doing a ramraid somewhere. It's a crime that largely goes unspoken, but it's important that we hear the detail, as confronting as it might be. This account is just one person's terrible experience among those of tens of thousands of children that have been sexually abused at more than 4,000 institutions over the course of 90 years. Every one of these personal accounts speaks to a national tragedy, as the Prime Minister rightly pointed out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we commemorate this fifth anniversary of the national apology, I want to pay tribute to several people. I acknowledge former prime minister Julia Gillard, who instigated the royal commission in 2012. I also acknowledge the royal commissioners and the public servants who supported them and listened to more than 8,000 stories, read a thousand submitted written accounts and answered more than 42,000 phone calls. I recognise former prime minister Scott Morrison who made the national apology in this place in 2018. As he eloquently put it then, it was 'a sorry that dare not try and make sense of the incomprehensible or think it could'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank my coalition colleagues past and present for responding to the royal commission's findings and the actions we took as a government to prevent and respond to child sexual abuse. We implemented strategies, funded initiatives and created institutions like the Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation. I express the opposition's gratitude to the Albanese government for carrying on the important work, especially through the National Redress Scheme. More than 31,800 applications have been received, round 13,800 are finalised and more than 13,000 payments totalling more than $1.1 billion have been made. I note too that the government has released its final response to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Final </span><span style="font-style:italic;">report of the second year review </span><span style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> the National Redress Scheme</span>. The opposition thanks and supports the government's commitment to improving the scheme for survivors, building on the efforts of the former coalition government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most importantly today, I want to again commend the 17,000 victims and survivors who shared their terrible stories and provided evidence to the royal commission. As a House today, we salute your courage. To every victim—those who spoke up, those who understandably could not and those who, ever so sadly, took their own lives to end the pain—we as a House express our sorrow for what you endured and that you had to tolerate the intolerable. We recognise that your suffering was a result of many failures through society: failures in our institutions, failures in our criminal justice and child welfare systems, and failures in leadership. For so many victims and survivors, the passing of time will never have dulled their torment nor diminished their trauma, but I imagine that every victim and survivor would want our nation to do its utmost to prevent other Australians from suffering similar horrors to those which they endured.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prime Minister, we extend the offer again today of bipartisanship for our country to commit to a royal commission in relation to child sexual abuse within Indigenous communities. No Australian is naive enough to believe that this crime type is not still taking place in homes, in classrooms and in churches around the country, but the prevalence within Indigenous communities is significant and is not to be ignored. Now is a time to do what is right. Now is a time to act with courage.</span>

What the Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke about was perfectly consistent with the motion that was moved in this parliament that was supported by the opposition on the floor of this parliament and that, indeed, we continue to support. I think it provides a principled way of moving forward. It stated that the House 'unequivocally condemns the attacks on Israel by Hamas'. It asserted 'Israel's right to defend itself'. It also called for the 'immediate and unconditional release of all hostages'. It condemned antisemitism. It went on to recognise that 'Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people, nor their needs and aspirations'. It acknowledged the 'devastating loss of Israeli and Palestinian life and that innocent civilians on all sides are suffering as a result of the attacks by Hamas and the subsequent conflict'. It said that this parliament 'supports justice and freedom for Israelis and Palestinians alike'. It said—and this was backed up by the foreign minister yesterday—that the House 'reiterates Australia's consistent position in all contexts is to call for the protection of civilian lives'.</span>

We know that. We have a responsibility to not seek to politicise these matters but engage in a principled way going forward. I condemn unequivocally, as well, the decision by some to have a demonstration in Caulfield on Friday night, as I condemn unequivocally the decision to ride motorbikes through the eastern suburbs of Sydney—I condemn that sort of provocation. It is vital at this time that people in positions of leadership exercise that leadership in a responsible way and seek to bring people together. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Robodebt, as members of the House will know, was a cruel and crude mechanism. It was neither fair nor legal. It made many people feel like criminals. It was costly in both human and economic terms. So, today, the Albanese government says, 'Never again.' We have already ceased the use of debt collection agencies for debt recovery in Services Australia. We've stopped the reverse onus of proof. We have stopped treating people who use our social security safety net as second-class cheats. Last week, we announced 3,000 new jobs on the front line of Services Australia to help people process their claims and calls.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">As someone who's a Liberal and believes in the sanctity of the individual, due process and the presumption of innocence, it offended all of those. It was illiberal, it reversed the onus and it hurt people.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, so far, the Leader of the Opposition has not taken the high road, as some of his colleagues have. Rather, last August he took the low road and accused the royal commission of morphing into a 'witch hunt'. The victims of robodebt have noticed the deafening silence and the truculent refusal of a full-throated of apology by the Leader of the Opposition. You cannot have justice for Australians and the promise that never again will it occur when the potential alternative government doesn't own the problem. You cannot have justice for the victims unless there is a guarantee that it won't be repeated again and that the lessons have been learnt. However, the Leader of the Opposition, so far, has given no sign of fully owning the disaster which was robodebt.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know the difference between a standard politician's apology—'If you are offended, I'm sorry'—and a real one. So it's time, Member for Dickson, for a real apology today in the parliament—right here, right now. Copy your courageous backbenchers, own the sins of the coalition and stop airbrushing history.</span>

Over the last 15 months, the cost of everything has gone up under this Prime Minister. The latest CPI data shows that food is up 8.2 per cent, housing costs are up 10.4 per cent, insurance is up 17.3 per cent, electricity is up 18.2 per cent and gas is up a massive 28 per cent. The Prime Minister has broken every promise made before the election and made poor decisions every day since. Why are Australians paying the price for a distracted and out-of-touch Prime Minister failing to focus on the real issues affecting Australians?</span>

There are three vital ways that we are tackling cost of living: getting costs down for families, getting wages up for workers and getting the budget onto a stronger foundation. On all of those measures, those opposite oppose everything positive that is put forward in this parliament. The Leader of the Opposition has nothing positive to offer the country. He just says no to everything that is put forward, opposes change and can't even lead his own party. He can't even appoint a shadow minister to replace Stuart Robert, who resigned about five months ago, because he is hampered by those people on his backbench.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the opposition by those opposite, we've delivered $23 billion in cost-of-living relief to Australians—$23 billion. There is cheaper child care, which began in July, and more Medicare bulk-billing, which began just this month with a tripling of the bulk-billing incentive. And there were cheaper medicines on 1 January and, again, there was the 60-day dispensing. This is the first question on the cost of living that we've had from them for months! Jim Chalmers doesn't have to worry about not being here because he won't get a question as the Treasurer!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had the energy bill relief, which we put together with the states and territories last year and which was opposed by those opposite. There's fee-free TAFE training—over 220,000 places making a difference for free. And building more affordable homes, again, was opposed by those opposite. It's just like they opposed our actions that have got wages growing at the fastest rate in a decade and just like they opposed the pay rise for age-care workers at 15 per cent. And it's just like when they said that an increase in the minimum wage would lead to the whole economy collapsing. We've created 550,000 jobs since we came to office. More jobs have been created on our watch than under any first-term government in Australia's history, and we're not even halfway through. And we did something those opposite never did: we turned a $78 billion deficit into a $22 billion surplus!</span>

She understands that robodebt will forever stand as one of the worst policy failures by any Australian government. It was a deliberate policy to hound Australians—not an accident and not a mistake. It was one that was accompanied by threats in this chamber to hunt people down—to hunt people down!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that it made an enormous difference to so many Australians, who were the most vulnerable. We know, as well, that it was raised in this chamber day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year. Those opposite knew that it was an illegal scheme, but that didn't stop them still pursuing some of the most vulnerable people in our society. It was a shocking abuse of trust that was exposed by the royal commission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People like Melanie Klieve told the royal commission: 'I had to sell everything I could sell just to get a little bit by. I had to go to the Salvation Army for the first time ever in my life, and it was quite degrading. It made me feel like I was a criminal. I never want to deal with Centrelink ever again.' This is the pathology of those opposite, the party of robodebt; cutting the humans out of Human Services and replacing them with a system that sent people notices and threats for debts which they did not owe. They ripped the social justice out of Social Services. The same ideology that produced robodebt still drives them today. The Leader of the Opposition has nothing positive to offer Australia: no plan and no solutions to the challenges facing the country. It's just saying no and opposing change.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that many people out there are doing it tough, which is why we've had cost-of-living relief, including cheaper medicines, which have saved $200 million on 17 million scripts in the first 10 months of this year. We've invested in affordable housing, including for women and children escaping domestic violence. We legislated energy bill relief for five million households. We invested in fee-free TAFE after a decade of cuts and neglect. All of those measures they opposed. Those opposite continue to show a total disregard for people who are doing it tough—just punishment, blame and vindictiveness. They never miss an opportunity to stand in the way of supporting those people who are the most vulnerable. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've worked through, with the Minns government in New South Wales, support for the Central West region. We have promised funding through the Central West Recovery and Resilience Package, jointly funded by the Commonwealth and New South Wales governments. It comprises $32 million for the Regional Transport Resilience Fund, $25 million for the Community Assets Program, $1 million for legal aid assistance and $2 million for the Central West Housing Consultation Program. We have in-principle agreement, in addition to that, for $40 million for the Central West housing program. This funding is to help the New South Wales Central West region's recovery from these devastating floods but also, importantly, to build resilience for the future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember sitting in rooms some years ago, before the former Labor government changed the rules, where you weren't allowed to build back better, and that makes no sense at all. It makes sense to actually take into account when a national disaster occurs, and that's why we have that funding for the Regional Transport Resilience Fund, which is aimed at how we build roads that don't just get washed away and therefore isolate communities in the future. This package includes support for the repair and replacement of critical community assets, improving the resilience of public infrastructure, as well as legal assistance. We've also got that in-principle support to match funding for a resilient housing program for the Central West. These are important projects which will be overseen by a forum of community leaders and reps from both Commonwealth and state governments. I know that the mayor there is a fine fellow, and he will be involved as well.</span>

I know this impacts on the member for Riverina's electorate as well, and I thank him for the representations that he's made. My government is determined to make sure that people aren't left behind in those communities, and that's why we've acted in partnership with the New South Wales government.</span>

What we saw is a decade of profound mismanagement of our migration system, and the consequence of that is that some incredibly vulnerable people were very, very badly hurt.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nixon report was received by the government and it made very damning findings about the migration compliance system that was set up and overseen by the Leader of the Opposition when he was in this portfolio. We have seen enormous damage result from the poor management of this system. I know the member for Paterson is particularly concerned about violence and abuse that is perpetrated against women. The Nixon report makes it very clear that women were predominantly the victims of the conduct that was uncovered. We saw horrible instances of violence. We saw awful instances of human trafficking. We saw awful examples of sexual abuse. All of this was facilitated by a broken migration system that was broken by the Leader of the Opposition.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have taken a very different approach to the management of this system. We've set rules and we are making sure that people are following those rules. The work that the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs and I are doing is imperative. We are assiduously and diligently working through all of the broken aspects of the system and fixing them piece by piece.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A really important part of the government's efforts is Operation Inglenook, which is an Australian Border Force led taskforce which is working around the clock to track down the criminals who came across the borders under those opposite and bring them to justice. In fact, just weeks after Operation Inglenook was stood up, the leader of a syndicate who was running brothels and his wife fled the country because they knew about the new approach the government was taking. I can tell the parliament that when they left the country what we did was cancel their visas and give them a lifetime ban on ever coming back into our country again. Operation Inglenook is absolutely essential. The fact that we had to set it up really demonstrates how poorly this system was being handled.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have completely redesigned the work that is done within the home affairs department. I want to draw the parliament's attention to one really important fact, which is that, under those opposite, the number of immigration compliance officers in our department was cut in half. What did they think was going to happen when they pulled resources out of the department and ABF? What we found is the borders didn't get properly managed.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Health and Aged Care and Deputy Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:41</span>):  I thank my friend and electoral neighbour the member for Boothby for her question. She had a long career in health care before coming to this place and she campaigned very hard in Adelaide on a promise to her community to strengthen Medicare. As a member of this government she is delivering on that promise in spades, through our three-point plan to strengthen Medicare, to triple the bulk-billing incentive, to roll out a network of Medicare urgent care clinics and bulk-billed clinics—including one in her electorate, in Boothby—and to make medicines cheaper.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The week before last the member for Boothby joined me at the Castle Medical Centre in Edwardstown, in her electorate, to announce almost $6 billion of new investments in Medicare that took effect on 1 November, including the tripling of the bulk-billing incentive—the largest investment in bulk-billing in the 40-year history of Medicare. Dr Ng told us that 80 per cent of the patients at her centre were either kids, pensioners or concession card holders covered by these new incentives. From 1 November, a bulk-billed standard consult at that centre goes up a whopping 34 per cent for all those patients.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BUTLER:</span>
                  </a>  The increase is even higher in regional Australia, with that standard consult going up by as much as 50 per cent. This is on top of the largest across-the-board increase to the Medicare rebate, that also took effect that day, in more than 30 years, since Paul Keating was prime minister—a bigger increase in this year alone than those opposite managed in six long years in government. We are already receiving reports of practices returning to bulk-billing or reaffirming their commitment to stick with bulk-billing if they were reconsidering it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The college of general practice called this investment a game changer, and it could not be more different to the approach from those opposite, particularly the approach from their leader—a health minister who said, it must be remembered, that in his view there were too many free Medicare services; a health minister who tried to abolish bulk-billing altogether and make every single patient pay a fee every single time they visited a doctor—every child, every pensioner, every concession card holder.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For Labor, bulk-billing is the beating heart of Medicare. Our historic investment is a huge boost in funding and confidence to the beleaguered general practice sector that was so neglected by the former government. Most importantly, it will make it easier and it will make it more affordable for millions of Australians to see their doctor.</span>

Before the last election, the Prime Minister promised real wage increases, but analysis of OECD data shows that, in the first 12 months of his government, Australian workers have suffered a 5.1 per cent decline in real income—the worst in the developed world. Yet again, the Prime Minister has misled the people. Why are Australians paying the price for a distracted prime minister who is failing to focus on the real issues affecting Australians?</span>

That was their deliberate policy. That was part of their economic architecture: a deliberate design. They might have forgotten a point in the election campaign when I was asked whether I would welcome a $1 increase in the minimum wage, and I said, 'Absolutely!' For days afterwards, those opposite railed about how this would destroy the economy and bring everything down. They thought that was the basis of an election campaign that was held—</span>

There has been since then another case in which, once again, there was a significant increase in the minimum wage—something that is very important going forward. In terms of wages, as well, we on this side of the House are very proud that, in response to the aged-care royal commission, we have had a 15 per cent wage increase for aged-care workers. That applies to nurses—those people who look after our older Australians and give them the dignity and respect that they deserve. Did those opposite, when they received the royal commission, do that? No, they didn't do it. They didn't do it because they regarded it as just not a priority. We on this side of the House also have our closing loopholes bill—</span>

He's someone who has been operating very constructively with the closing loopholes bill—and I note that he's on the list to speak on it later today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Contrast that constructive way of engaging with the Manager of Opposition Business, who, earlier today, organised a filibuster on his own amendment to prevent it from coming to a vote! I've not seen that before, but that's what we had today to prevent his own amendment from coming to a vote. But that same constructive way of engaging that I referred to with the member for Bennelong has been how a whole lot of the employer groups have been engaging as well. I want to pay tribute to the work of the Australian Hotels Association. I know that the member for Bennelong would have many casuals employed by hotels and organisations which are members of the Hotels Association in his electorate. What did Stephen Ferguson have to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments which have been committed to provide much more certainty and fairness for workers and employers and can be chalked up as a win for both.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the Hotels Association isn't the only one that has been engaging positively with government. I've got to say, and I think the health minister will agree with me, that we don't often get the Pharmacy Guild turning up to Labor Party branch meetings. But the Pharmacy Guild has seen the common sense of the amendments which have been negotiated with respect to casuals and has said the following:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Pharmacy Guild of Australia supports the Albanese Government's decision to amend the 'Closing the Loopholes' bill in the interests of both casual employees and employers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite have voted consistently, and are doing so again today, to delay any provision that is about people being underpaid—any provision that's about people being underpaid! They want to say, and they hide behind it—'We're just wanting to advance the ones about safety.' If that were true, why are they not trying to advance the clauses about industrial manslaughter? Are they, somehow, nothing to do with safety? Do they not understand that labour hire workers are far much less likely to speak up about safety issues on a mine site than are people who are directly employed?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government will not say to workers who are being underpaid that their concern is somehow not so controversial, that it's a second-rate concern and something that we would vote to delay. We're not going to say to gig workers, 'You can just wait as long as possible before you have any minimum rates.' We're not going to say to the families of people who have died at work, 'Oh, we'll just delay industrial manslaughter into the never-never.' We're not going to say to people who have their wages stolen deliberately by their employers that it's somehow not urgent or that it's too controversial to make wage theft a crime, or to the casuals who are working as though they're permanent and who just want security that this government will not— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

We appointed a four-person independent panel to consult the farmers, communities and supply chain participants—to do all of this, to inform when and how this policy could be implemented. That's why we've very clearly not put a date on when the phase-out will occur. We've said we'll consult with industry in the interests of a strong and sustainable future for the Australian sheep, wool and sheepmeat industry. One of the things that we've been doing as well, it must be said, is negotiating with our trading nations, in order to open up our exports further.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingston</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Social Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:56</span>):  I'd like to thank the member for McEwen for his question and for his strong advocacy for so many families and pensioners in his electorate. Our government knows many families are feeling cost-of-living pressures. That's why the Albanese Labor government is delivering $23 billion in cost-of-living relief to make things easier, including by strengthening our social security safety net. In my portfolio alone, we are helping families by increasing the maximum rate of rent assistance, expanding the single parent payment and increasing paid parental leave. At the same time, we've lifted the base rate of many working-age and student payments to provide extra support for those doing it tough. We are providing direct and tangible support to hundreds of thousands of families and pensioners in different settings and different circumstances. This support is flowing into household budgets now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have delivered the biggest increase in rent assistance in more than 30 years for around 1.1 million households, including pensioners and families who receive family tax benefit. That's more money to help cover the cost of rent. For many families, more rent assistance complements the extra support we're delivering through electricity bill relief, cheaper child care, cheaper medicines and investment in bulk billing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For single parents, who face the difficult challenge of balancing work and care on their own, we've extended the eligibility for single-parent payment until their youngest child turns 14. This will result in an extra 65,000 single parents being better off by, on average, $170 per fortnight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the parents of newborns, the government is delivering the biggest investment in paid parental leave since it was introduced in 2011. We've expanded access to more families, including introducing a $350,000 family income limit, and made it much easier for both parents to share care. From 2024, we will expand the scheme by an extra six weeks, reaching six months by 2026. That's over $5,000 extra to help cover time off around the birth of a baby and help juggle work and care. Not only will our investments help families, but they will help participation and productivity, so there is a dividend to the Australian economy as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this Labor government, my colleagues and I are working across government every day to deliver cost-of-living relief, including through the measures I've outlined, and we will continue to work for Australian families, to deliver for them now and into the future.</span>

We have said very clearly that Israel does have a right to defend itself. We have also said that the way that it does matters, and we must distinguish between Hamas and Palestinian citizens. We have said the same thing consistently.

I have said very clearly that every Israeli and every Palestinian life matters—every one: every child, every baby, every innocent civilian.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say with respect to the member for Melbourne that during this debate it does not assist to suggest that somehow the government or indeed any individual, unless you have some basis for it, is dismissive of the loss of life of people in Gaza or in Israel. I have met with the Islamic leadership of this country from right around the country. I have met with Jewish community leaders. This is a really difficult time, and community cohesion matters. The attempt to somehow say that Australia is engaged in on-the-ground action almost with some of the comments you read is just not accurate and is not appropriate in my view. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have said that we want humanitarian pauses as the necessary first step. We have said that any step on the path to ceasefire can't be one-sided. Hamas is still bombing Israel, still using human shields and still holding more than 200 hostages. I've said really consistently that Hamas has contempt for international law—they're a terrorist organisation—but Israel, as a democratic nation, has the responsibility to uphold international law and to protect innocent lives and to protect civilians, including children. It's a message I give here and it's a message I gave when I spoke to leaders in those countries as well. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Last week's Optus network outage impacted some 10 million Australian consumers and businesses across mobile, broadband and fixed-line services, underscoring just how essential connectivity is for all Australians. The impacts were felt across the economy and the community, with repercussions for eftpos systems, hospitals and public transport. Consumers and business customers were understandably frustrated. It was not just an inconvenience. For some small businesses it represented a whole day's trade and for Australians with a disability, including those relying on internet assisted technology, the outage would have been deeply distressing.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman is available to provide support to consumers and small businesses who were impacted if direct engagement with Optus does not result in a satisfactory outcome. The TIO has useful and clear information on its website that is specifically relevant to this outage. The ACCC also offers information about the relevant rights under consumer law. I encourage all members to visit accc.gov.au and tio.com.au and share these important materials with their constituents. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians expect and deserve better from their communications service providers. It is essential that we understand what happened, what went wrong and what improvements can be made by the sector as a whole in order to reduce the risk of a future disruption of this scale recurring for any major telecommunications provider.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why I have tasked my department to establish a post- incident review. My department is currently working on the terms of reference, and the government will make further announcements in due course. This will include an examination of issues, such as the adequacy of regulatory settings to support access to 000 emergency services, amongst other important matters. Importantly, independently, the regulator, the Australian Communications and Media Authority, has also announced that it has commenced an investigation into Optus's compliance with rules requiring emergency calls to be successfully carried from each telecommunications provider to the emergency call service, which is Telstra. Our government will carefully consider recommendations from the upcoming reviews to ensure regulatory and policy settings adapt and respond so as to keep Australian safe and reliably connected.</span>

Perhaps I can begin by reminding him and all members that last Wednesday afternoon the High Court handed down a decision which required the release of individuals from immigration detention. The High Court handed down a decision which we, of course, are complying with. I would say that, as we heard earlier, not every Australian government has complied with the requirements of the law nor respected separation of powers. Can I say this too? The Commonwealth argued against the decision that ultimately the High Court maintained. But, of course, we were prepared, as I think the shadow minister's question suggests, for this outcome because of the significance of this case. Members would appreciate that the case has overturned a precedent of nearly two decades.</span>

I hope that that is the concern that is echoed across this chamber and in the other place. To that end, the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Border Force have been working closely with our state and territory authorities. I'll make very clear that that cooperation through the ABF commenced prior to the decision being handed down. In recognition of our apprehension of the seriousness of an adverse decision to the Commonwealth, we took those steps in advance of it. We also established a joint operation with state and federal—</span>

We moved quickly to ensure that we issued visas to impacted individuals with appropriate conditions to ensure that community safety can be upheld, including requirements to report readily to the department to inform the minister of any changes of personal details such as address, social media profiles, restrictions of industries on employment and a range of other conditions.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hotham</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Cyber Security</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:10</span>):  In my role as Minister for Cyber Security, I'm not always able to get up and deliver positive news to the parliament, but we do have good news today. This afternoon, DP World announced that they are resuming operations at their facilities. Their expectation is that 5,000 containers will leave their ports today. The incident at DP World is the latest in a string of cyberattacks which have shaken our country, and this is why this is such a central priority for our government. The DP World incident also shows that some of the critical reforms that our government has put in place in the past 18 months are actually working.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Australians are probably not really conscious of the tremendous complexity that's involved in managing a cyber incident of this size. In the case of DP World, we have a company that manages 40 per cent of freight movements in and out of our country. The implications of a shutdown, even briefly, of the ports are very widespread, affecting most of the parts of the Australian economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the instance of this particular cyberattack, the National Cyber Security Coordinator was on the ground effectively immediately, working with the company and across industries to help manage the impacts of this. The National Coordination Mechanism, which was triggered for the first time by our government in the context of the Optus attack, has been meeting daily to manage the impacts of this serious incident, and it's been able to also coordinate the Australian Cyber Security Centre in its engagement with the company and the Australian Federal Police.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's really important for the parliament to understand that none of these mechanisms would have been possible without the reforms of our government and under the former government. But we're not satisfied with clearing what has been an impossibly low bar set by opposite in cybersecurity. Let's remember that they didn't even have a cybersecurity minister. Let's pause on that point for a moment. We've dealt with a lot of cyber incidents in the last 18 months. They didn't even have a minister who was clearly in charge of these issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have implemented enormous reform in the 18 months that we've been in government. We have declared 168 critical infrastructure assets to be systems of national significance. We've commenced a very substantial, very important set of national cyber exercises, which help us flex and build that muscle. Indeed, today the government made two announcements about policy reforms that will be contained in the forthcoming national cybersecurity strategy. One of those is to introduce mandatory reporting requirements for ransomware attacks around Australia, and the second is to lift the requirements that we place on telecommunications companies to make sure that those telcos, which can do so much to affect the cybersecurity of every citizen in our country, are meeting their responsibilities. We've got a big mess to clean up here, but there's lots of work underway, and I'm proud of the work that's been done so far.</span>

It's one of the reasons interest rates have increased, which is hurting working Australians immensely. Fuel prices will go up and down, but a cut to fuel excise would lower costs and reduce inflation now. Why won't the government reduce the fuel excise at a time when it has a budget surplus and provide instant cost-of-living and mortgage relief to families, especially in Western Sydney?</span>

                  </a>  We inherited, when we came to office, a decision of the former government that they put in their budget in March 2022—a limited-time pause on fuel indexation. They put that limited period there because, when it comes to the issue of petrol indexation, one of the concerns in the economy, including from the Reserve Bank, which feeds into interest rates is how much cash there is in the economy. So we have purposefully targeted cost-of-living relief through the increase in payments, which the Minister for Social Services spoke about earlier today and the Minister for Health and Aged Care also spoke about, with cheaper medicines and the tripling of the bulk billing incentive. We have very consciously targeted the relief at families, through child care relief as well. We will always look at measures to—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:16</span>):  I thank the member for Moreton for his question. We know that the world is confronting serious challenges and economic headwinds and that what happens internationally matters at home. It's crucial that Australia take its seat at the table and speaks up for our interests. That's how we get results for Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that for jobs, trade, the economy and security, engagement matters. That's why I was pleased to be the first Australian PM to visit China since 2016. This is one of our most important relationships. More than one in four of Australia's export dollars derives from the relationship with China. Indeed, more than one in four of Australia's jobs depend upon trade. We have been patient, calibrated and deliberate in our approach to this relationship. It's already paying dividends, removing trade impediments on timber, coal, barley, hay and a range of other products and creating a path forward for wine exports from Australia. Between January and August this year, and there's been a huge bump since then, Australia exported to China $6 billion worth of products that had had impediments placed on them. Compare that to the $85 million for the same period last year. That's $85 million up to $6 billion. It's no wonder the National Party are so pleased about this, as well, because it's had a particular impact in regional Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was in Port Lincoln, they were already signing deals on barley. Barley is already in China from Australia, making a difference. The wine industry has had bumper crops that are sitting there waiting to be exported, and already, there are negotiations on a deal there. I look forward to the removal of any of the impediments across the board. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In regard to the visit to the Cook Islands, it was also important that we engage with our Pacific neighbours. We know what happened with security arrangements during the last government. Our government has reached out and ensured that we are involved in securing peace and stability in the region. As a result of Tuvalu's approach, the Falepili Union, the Tuvaluan word for the traditional values of good neighbourliness, care and mutual respect, is a bilateral treaty that will come before this parliament. It will deal with climate change, including disaster assistance and coastal adaptation; a special mobility pathway to enable an initial cap of 280 people per year; and, importantly, a security agreement, a mutual agreement on any arrangement or engagement with any other state or entity on security and defence-related matters in Tuvalu. This is very important for Australia's security.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you very much. In question time today, the member for Maribyrnong suggested that I hadn't expressed remorse in relation to the robodebt issue. I'd point the minister to comments I made at a doorstop in Brisbane on 8 July, where I said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It went on. Secondly, on 13 July, in an interview with Ray Hadley, I said:</span>

                    </a>  But, Mr Speaker, that's not the situation we're in. No member has moved, first of all, in relation to the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Strengthening Protections Against Discrimination) Bill—there was no minister at the table, so there has been no motion indicating what is to happen to that bill. So I'm seeking an indication from you or, indeed, from the Leader of the House, as to what is to happen, firstly to the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Strengthening Protections Against Discrimination) Bill? And, secondly, what is to happen in relation to the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency) Bill 2023, consistent with the procedure that was observed in relation to the first of these four bills, the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Small Business Redundancy Exemption) Bill 2023?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What happened with that bill, of course, was that upon you announcing that the message had been received, the Leader of the House stood and there was a first reading. He then moved that the second reading be made an order of the day for the next sitting. I'm seeking your ruling as to what happens now.</span>

                    </a>  I presume this is a point of order that you're seeking a ruling on, so this is just a contribution. There are four different messages being received from the Senate. The presiding officer has an obligation to report those messages to us. What we do with those messages is a matter for the House. On the first of those messages: I moved that it be made an order of the day. I understand why an amendment was moved to consider it immediately; the thing that I don't understand is why there was then a filibuster so that we got to 1.30 without any of the questions being resolved. As a result, that motion will appear in future on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> under government business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the second one—there are four—the antidiscrimination one: I understand that it has been reported to the House and no-one moved anything. That's a right of the House, if no-one wants to move anything. So then we get to the third message, which I think is where we're up to now. Particularly when government legislation comes in, there's very much an obligation on the Leader of the House to take the lead on how government legislation is dealt with. Ministers don't have that obligation for business that arises is private member's business. It's completely up to the Manager of Opposition Business—as I've done previously, years ago in the past—or for crossbenchers, or whoever wants to jump, to jump up. But there's certainly no obligation on anyone in the House to deal with a message. It's up to members.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the first one has gone as a result of the filibuster, and that will be on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>. The second one the House chose not to deal with, and we're now up to the third message. If a member chooses to deal with that, they can, but it's certainly not incumbent on us to do that.</span>

                    </a>  I make the point that, because of the way the notice in relation to Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Strengthening Protections Against Discrimination) Bill was handled, it should be recommitted. Certainly on this side of the House, in good faith, we were waiting for the government to stand up and deal with it exactly as it did with the first of these. If what the Leader of the House is now admitting is that he's engaged in some sharp practice to allow this to go through so that the government can achieve its objective of not having this matter dealt with immediately, I think there should clearly be a recommittal.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's first turn to the notice from the Senate which is before the House at the moment, which is transmitting the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency) Bill 2023 for concurrence. If the Leader of the House is not going to move that the matter be dealt with, if he is again proposing to remain silent in the rather curious way that he's just done in relation to the second bill—part, I might say, of a pretty deliberate effort to avoid this bill coming on for debate in the full knowledge that both the opposition and, I'd venture to suggest, a number of the members of the crossbench are eager to see—if the Leader of the House—</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr FLETCHER:</span>
                    </a>  Yes, and I now proceed to speak to my motion, Mr Speaker. Again, for the benefit of all those in the House, what I am moving is: 'That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Manager of Opposition Business from moving that the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency) Bill 2023 be brought on for debate immediately.' The reason that I am moving this is that it is clear from the conduct of the government that it is doing everything it possibly can to avoid having a debate on and, importantly, moving to vote on these four pieces of legislation, of which the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency) Bill 2023 is one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason that standing and sessional orders need to be suspended is that, first of all, the substance of the matters in this bill are matters of substance which go to important rights for workers, particularly the amendments to the Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency Act to broaden the functions of the Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency. This would allow the agency to play a central role in coordinating, monitoring and reporting on national efforts to eliminate asbestos and silicon related diseases in Australia and to support those affected by these diseases. This is a matter of importance because, thanks to work done in the Senate, there is now a bill before the House which would allow the House to deal with this matter immediately. I refer, of course, to the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency) Bill 2023, the bill that's been the subject of the message we've just received. That was debated and voted on by the Senate last week, and the Senate passed this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is now the option for the House to consider this matter immediately. It is not a contentious proposition that these matters are of considerable importance. Let me quote, for example, the member for McEwen. He's not somebody I would typically quote, but on this occasion I am pleased to quote the member for McEwen. He had this to say: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The need to extend the functions of the Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency to address silica related diseases is something that was brought home to me through meetings with the ACTU …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be very clear about what is going on in this House. The provisions that were contained in a bill moved by the government, rejoicing in the Orwellian name of 'Closing Loopholes', packages together some extremely politically contentious matters which are all about the government responding to the aspirations and desires of its paymasters in the union movement. It packages together those contentious matters with matters that are widely accepted as necessary to be dealt with, as a matter of urgency, by the union movement, the business community, the government, the opposition and, I'm informed, by most, if not all, of the crossbenchers. This is an opportunity for this House to deal with that matter immediately.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen a consistent pattern, by this government today, of doing everything it can to avoid this House engaging efficiently and promptly with these bills. We've seen this government doing everything it could to delay these being brought on and, I may also say, doing everything it could to avoid being put in a position where it needs to vote on these matters. But the effect of this suspension of standing orders motion, Mr Speaker—and through you to the House—is that it allows the Australian people, and indeed this House, to see very clearly where this government stands on these matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is an opportunity for the government to join with the opposition—and, I'm informed, some, if not all, of the crossbench—in support of this bill, to pass this bill immediately. This bill would have the effect of broadening the powers of the Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency. This government has done everything it could to avoid being put in a position where it needs to deal with this matter in this House. But I'd suggest that that is not, from the point of view of this House and its members, a satisfactory way to deal with this matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the effect of the suspension of standing orders that I am moving is that, if the suspension is passed, it would put me in a position to move that the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency) Bill 2023 be brought on for debate and, indeed, a vote, immediately. That is the simple proposition that I am putting to the House. There's 25 minutes of debate on this particular bill. I'm conscious that there may be crossbench colleagues who wish to speak, so I will conclude my contribution here, and I hope that crossbench colleagues who have views may choose to express them.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr HOGAN:</span>
                    </a>  Thank you, Mr Speaker. Just to put into context what is going on in the chamber, the government has its Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Closing Loopholes) Bill, which has gone through the Senate. The Senate passed four amendments to that legislation, and this is one of them. At the moment, we are talking about the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency) Bill 2023. What we could do right now is pass this specific amendment, which is part of a bigger bill that the government hasn't been able to get through the Senate yet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is, in reality, a goodwill gesture from the opposition. We are saying four things could happen right now. Members of the government spoke very passionately about this element, the Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency, when the bigger bill was going through. They spoke about the urgency with which it needed to happen. So what we are doing is an element of goodwill. The opposition and, I'm sure, many crossbenchers got up and spoke about the first amendment today and were happy to support this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why would we want to rush this through? When you talk about occupational health and safety nothing is more important than the asbestos safety and eradication bill. It will expand the functions of the Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency and will allow the agency to play a role in monitoring and reporting on national efforts to eliminate asbestos and silica related diseases in Australia and support those affected by the diseases. The agency is well regarded for its role, and the bill would provide the agency with silica oversight functions and would allow it to leverage its experience with asbestos and take on cross-portfolio coordination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will be really interesting to see what the government does here. This bill is one of four on which we are saying to the government: these four elements of the bill were important to you. We are saying that the opposition, and many crossbenchers also, will vote for this to happen today. So it is over to the government. Do they want these benefits? Do they want this amendment and others to come into force for workers in the Australian economy now or not? That is their decision. It will be interesting to see what they vote on because they spoke very passionately about the importance of this bill in particular, about its importance for the health and safety of Australian workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate in its wisdom went through a process and has sent back to the House these four amendments as separate bills. We are saying that we don't want the government to put them on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> and kick them out into the never-never. We do not think that is in the interests of Australian workers. I commend the crossbenchers who spoke on an earlier amendment this morning. We are trying to be constructive. We are trying to make this particular issue come into force for Australian workers earlier than it otherwise would be. This one specifically is important in that it relates to the health and health benefits of Australian workers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This will be important. Is this just politics for the government and they won't take this measure of goodwill from the opposition to pass this now? Are they going to take their bat and go home and not allow to pass this amendment, which is good from the Australian workforce. They have the support of the opposition in this chamber, and of many crossbenchers as well. The minister is very passionate about this part of the closing loopholes bill. I encourage the minister to take this gesture of goodwill and let us pass this amendment today.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Watson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Minister for the Arts and Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:44</span>):  I appreciate the opportunity to speak. I had wanted to speak during the debate this morning, but, of course, as I had been the mover of the motion I had to wait for there to be no-one else to rise because, otherwise, giving the right of reply would have closed off debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason the first resolution today will never get voted on is the hijinks of the opposition. They thought there'd be a clever game to filibuster, they thought they'd dare me into moving that the question be put and, all the while, they were simply behaving in a way that prevented their own amendment from being put. Then we had a complaint from the Manager of Opposition Business that somehow it was unreasonable that, having spent the whole morning complaining about the resolution the government had moved, when the next message came the government didn't stand up and move a resolution. It turned out that without the government moving a resolution the opposition chose not to either. So the second bill has no response from the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't expect every member of the House to be ruthlessly following procedure, but I would have thought the Manager of Opposition Business would have a cursory glance at what's happening with procedure, particularly when there are bills that are not government bills that are coming through as messages. Now we're on the third of those. What is in front of us is not what was just put by the Deputy Manager of Opposition Business. The Deputy Manager of Opposition Business just claimed something that is not accurate. He claimed that the 'closing loopholes' bill has gone to the Senate and that they have considered it, made amendments and sent back different parts of it. That identical claim was made in similar terms in the debate this morning. It's similar to some of the coverage where people have said that, somehow, the bill I introduced has been split in the Senate. The bill is still here. The bill is listed for debate and listed for debate today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The question that is before us now with this suspension is: today, do we debate which of two options? Do we debate a bill that only deals with the impact of what I introduced on the Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency, or do we deal with a bill that deals with every single clause of that and also deals with every other loophole that has been introduced to this House? That's the choice. Either way, we end up today debating the impact of including silica as one of the things the asbestos agency has to deal with. Either way, the House will debate that today. But the question is: do we only deal with that, or do we deal with that plus the other measures that are loopholes the government has said it wants to close?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You might ask the question: if those opposite are so passionate about this one, why is it that, for nine years, nothing was done on it? If they are so passionate about the impact of silica dust, why was it that, when I turned up to my Safe Work Australia meeting as minister and there were all the states, there had been no attempt to do the work we then commissioned on the deadly impact of kitchen benchtops? Why was it that none of that work had been done? For each of the four measures the Senate has been sending messages on, how many of those four did any member of the opposition in government or in opposition call on me to introduce? The answer is: not one. Not one of them! So don't come in here suddenly saying that you think you're going to position the government and we'll feel bad and we'll look like we're on the back foot. We want to debate all those measures, and we intend to do it today. That's why we're opposing the suspension.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we think, 'Is this a tactic to delay or not from them?'—think about this: the first thing they did when I introduced the 'closing loopholes' bill was to attempt to delay it for six weeks. The very next day, they changed their position and, instead of delaying it till October to commence debate, they wanted to delay it until February. Then the Senate, immediately after they passed these individual bills, voted to change the requirements for the Senate committee that was looking into the provisions that are in these bills—provisions that stakeholders have made submissions on and that the committee is very likely to recommend amendments to. What did those opposite or their counterparts in the other place do? They immediately moved to change the reporting requirements for the Senate committee from it having to report by 1 February next year to 'it must not report before'. So they deliberately have created a situation where the consultation has been commenced on this bill that you want to debate now. You say, 'Oh, let's just put it straight through.' Stakeholders have put forward submissions, wanting amendments to it. There's a Senate committee still considering it. That Senate committee was likely to have been in a position to report next week, but the Liberal and National parties voted in the Senate to say that, even if it is ready—even if it has considered those submissions and is ready to make a recommendation—they won't allow it to. That's how the Liberal and National parties voted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For each of the provisions—on PTSD, on silica, which is what we have here, and on the small business redundancy issue that we dealt with earlier—there are submissions that people have made in good faith. Who are these people? They're very often people who have lived experience and whose lives have been in some way destroyed or changed from what they otherwise might have been because of exactly these issues. They've made submissions asking for amendments. Those opposite will pretend to be the friends of the issue. Having asked for submissions, they have then said, 'But you're not allowed to report until 1 February, but let's just put it through in its first form anyway.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is always the case, particularly in this portfolio, that government legislation introduced here ends up being amended as a result of a Senate inquiry. You don't get to introduce industrial relations or workplace relations legislation without a Senate inquiry, and you always end up with amendments as a result. But never before have I seen a situation where the opposition and crossbench in the Senate, who traditionally are the champions of due process, have decided to start that due process and then not allow it to be concluded before the legislation gets locked in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So why would this have unfolded? I have a lot of respect for Senator David Pocock, Senator Tyrrell and Senator Lambie, but Senator Lambie, on Radio National, made it clear. Why were these the four issues? Because those were the ones on which they could get the agreement of the other side. So that's what we've got here. It is not that these issues are the only ones that make a difference to people's lives. I'll tell you what: spend five minutes with people who've lost a loved one at work and ask them whether we should have industrial manslaughter laws. Somehow there's been a decision that they're not urgent. Ask a casual working permanent shifts who could easily be transferred into secure employment because they have a firm advance commitment, but whose employer refuses to do that, whether they'd like to be able to do that. Ask them whether, without secure employment, they have any chance of being able to get a loan from the bank. What does that mean for their lives? But those opposite have decided: 'Oh, that's not urgent. Push that off.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, ask someone on a mine site. Those opposite will talk a lot about coal, but they won't talk a lot about the workers. Ask someone on a mine site who is being paid less than the person beside them, even though they've both worked there for the same length of time, simply because of the accident that one is employed by a labour hire company and the other isn't. They have the same qualifications and are doing the same job. One of those people is being underpaid. Tell them that, with everything that's going on with cost of living, we shouldn't be dealing with their underpayment. I'm sure everybody here, including me, has gig workers delivering food to their home sometimes on a weekend. It is not that those gig workers have unreasonable minimum rates; they have no minimum rates. I'm not willing to tell them that their concerns are second rate.</span>

We'll end up doing some late nights to make sure we do, but we owe it to the people whose lives are affected to ensure that a whole bill goes through. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

For those of you who were listening to the Leader of the House in his earlier mellifluous, calm, 'nothing to see here' presentation, he was busy giving the impression that it is nothing out of the ordinary for the government to sit there, arms folded and do nothing, when a message comes from the Senate saying that a bill has been passed. It's perfectly standard, apparently! Are there pieces of evidence which suggest that it's very far from standard and is, in fact, part of a sneaky strategy that the Leader of the House and the government have been passing all day to avoid being put in a position where they could move quickly to introduce safeguards for workers that they have been arguing around the country are important?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's one powerful piece of evidence that it was pretty sneaky stuff. That powerful piece of evidence is that, around midday when the first message from the Senate arrived—the first in respect of four bills which were passed by the Senate last week—what the government chose to do after the first reading of the bill was to move that the second reading be made an order of the day for the next sitting—in other words, deal with the matter as a responsible government managing the flow of legislation would do. Of course, when the second message from the Senate came on shortly after question time, it turned out the Leader of the House was on a go-slow. The Leader of the House was on a stop-work. He just wandered off. Nothing happened. There were shrieks of silence. There was complete inactivity. There was no hand on the tiller. That is something that all Australians who care about good government should be very concerned about, but it should also put you on notice that this is very sneaky stuff going on from the Leader of the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will point to a second piece of evidence that this is very sneaky stuff. If we have a look at the daily program circulated by the authority of the Leader of the House, no less, what does it say that the government is going to do in respect of four bills coming from the Senate? In respect of the first of them—the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Small Business Redundancy Exemption) Bill 2023—it says: 'First reading. Second reading to be made an order of the day for the next sitting.' That's exactly what happened it midday. At least, that's what the Leader of the House attempted to do at midday, but we then moved a motion to have this matter brought on as quickly as possible. When the message in respect of the second of these four bills came from the Senate, what did the Leader of the House do? Nothing! He sat there—no action. Stop work—all out. On this rare occasion, this was not done at a time when a concrete slab had been poured, but it was very much in the finest traditions of the unions that are constituent members, funders and paymasters of the Labor Party. Why did the Leader of the House do that? Why did he do precisely the opposite of what was stated on the daily program circulated under the very authority of the Leader of the House? Why did he do that? Why did he do that in respect of the next bill when a message came from the Senate? That was the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency) Bill. Why has he just done it again—the third shameful piece of inaction?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's the third time he has chosen to do precisely the opposite of what the document circulated under his own authority to all parliamentarians and members of this House says. The document says: 'First reading. Second reading to be made an order of the day for the next sitting.' Then when the opposition asked, 'It seems a bit irregular; why is this happening?' according to the Leader of the House it was nothing out of the ordinary and there was nothing to see. In fact, there was everything to see. It put the opposition in the unpalatable position of there being no option but to move that so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the order of the day for the consideration of the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (First Responders) Bill 2023 being called on immediately. Why are we doing that? We are doing that because the Leader of the House and the government have chosen not to act. We are therefore moving a suspension of standing orders so this matter can be called on for those who consider that it is an important opportunity for the parliament to act quickly to legislate a measure for which there is agreement between the government, the opposition and, I am advised, many members of the crossbench. This is an opportunity to move quickly to legislate and to bring into effect measures that are given effect under the first responders bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is very important legislation. It would amend the law relating to work health and safety and workers' compensation and rehabilitation. In particular, it would give fairer treatment to first responders. That might include, for example, people who have been employed as a firefighter, an ambulance officer or in other very important occupations. This is the reason why the opposition is moving this. It's because this is an opportunity for the government to join with the opposition and the crossbench to move quickly to legislate a measure which the government has expressly said it supports. But, for reasons that are frankly inexplicable, the government is choosing to sit on its hands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We were prepared to give them the benefit of the doubt when it came to the first bill of the four that were before the House. There was every opportunity for the Leader of the House and the government to indicate that they would be supporting the bill. We could have moved very quickly. But, unfortunately, that's not the approach the government has taken. What is troubling is that we have seen the same approach taken on bill after bill. It's particularly troubling that we have seen some pretty sneaky behaviour by the government to seek to avoid the operation of the normal processes of this place. But the suspension of standing orders that I am moving would allow this parliament to deal with this matter with the alacrity it deserves. That is why it is urgent that standing and sessional orders be suspended.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is quite remarkable that the government and just about every member who has spoken in the second reading debate has given passionate arguments as to why these measures in relation to first responders are so important. On this side of the House, we agree. Indeed, all material stakeholders within our society agree. The chance this House now has is to vote very quickly to put this legislation into force. We heard how many words from the Leader of the House saying, 'If it were not for these procedural motions from the opposition there would be an opportunity to return to the bill'? But we know that all that would do is allow more time for debate. What the opposition is proposing, and what this measure is directed to achieve, is the opportunity for this House to vote quickly and to put in place immediately the measures that apply to the benefit of first responders. It is quite extraordinary that the Labor Party, the supposed champion of the worker, is not wanting to do this. It's not wanting to seize the opportunity the Senate in its wisdom has provided to this House. This House can join with the Senate. This House can demonstrate a bipartisan approach and work together to put in place in very short order these desirable and necessary changes in relation to first responders. It is for these reasons that I commend this suspension to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr HOGAN:</span>
                    </a>  There is, and I have just signed it. I'll put this into context. We have a larger omnibus bill that is being debated in this chamber and will go through to the Senate at a later date. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations is very aware of the public comment that there are many contentious parts of the ominous bill. I acknowledge that it will get voted through this House, but the Senate has already reflected that many areas of the ominous bill will have a lot of debate and a lot of amendments. A lot of things will go on. That bill, as the minister said, will probably look nothing like it does now. It's very common, as the minister said, to have an IR piece of legislation that doesn't have amendments in the Senate and goes off to committee and then a whole lot of other things happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we're talking about now is a private senator's bill that has come to the House from the Senate. There are four elements of the larger omnibus bill that the Senate has passed already. They have said: 'There will be no amendments to this part of the legislation. We're good with this. We see this is important for workers.' That chamber has passed that and sent it to us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're saying to the government: 'We know that four elements of your larger omnibus bill are going to be accepted by that chamber with no amendments.' The minister should be ecstatic about this. No minister really wants to see amendments to their legislation. This special IR legislation is going to go through with no amendments. So the government and the minister have a choice today. They can say: 'There are contentious parts of the ominous bill. There will be a lot of amendments moved. There will be committees and delay. The benefits for workers may not happen until well into next year.' So the minister and the government have the choice today to pass the four elements in this chamber, knowing they will pass the Senate as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion is about the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (First Responders) Bill 2023. We had one about the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency) Bill 2023 before. I'll just touch on what this bill is. This change will simplify workers compensation systems and will provide, unless proven otherwise, the presumption that PTSD suffered by first responders was likely contributed to by their employment as a first responder. That's obviously a great part of the larger omnibus bill. We support that part of the bill. We support and think that it's important for first responders to be appropriately protected and have access to workers compensation systems easily and in a timely manner. That's what the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (First Responders) Bill 2023 is about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge what the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations said earlier—that we may be perceived as being pre-emptive and that we may be perceived as not allowing the Senate to have normal due process. If I were the minister and the government, I would say: 'This is a really important part of the larger omnibus bill. This is an opportunity for the government to get this particular section of the larger bill through this chamber today.' Given that the government has the opportunity right now to pass this bill in this chamber, I would say that all first responders would say that the government should do that. Yes, it might not be the normal process. Yes, it is a private senator's bill that has come from the Senate, which is not the normal convention. Yes, it is before some committee processes have happened. Will there be amendments moved on this particular section of the bill in the Senate? Maybe not. Maybe everyone will say that this is exactly how it should be worded or written.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would say to the government and to the minister that this is a really important section of this larger bill. I would say to the government and to the minister that I think every first responder in this country would say that they think you should support this bill. I support the motion put by the Manager of Opposition Business. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Watson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Minister for the Arts and Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:19</span>):  I'll deal with some procedural issues before I deal with the substance of what's before us. The Manager of Opposition Business went through what's in the blue, the daily program, and said that it was somehow in there an expectation that the Leader of the House, being me, was definitely going to be the one who would move that it be made an order of the day for the next sitting. The blue says that that will be moved by someone. But, when something comes through as a private members' bill, there is no presumption that it will be done by a minister. I know I did it on the first one, and I then endured a wonderful hour and a half of speeches telling me why it was a terrible thing to have done. And so I didn't do it on the three subsequent motions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Apparently, all of those speeches for the hour and a half, which was what prevented the first bill from ever making it onto the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>, were apparently not true, if you were to believe the Manager of Opposition Business. He said in his speech on that first bill that we could have moved very quickly. Yes, we could have. But I couldn't give the right of reply speech until no-one else was jumping. The only way to move more quickly was either to (a) not filibuster or (b) for me to move that the member be no further heard or that the question be put, which I reckon, if I'd done so, the opposition would have had a problem and voted against that. The reason it wasn't done quickly was the behaviour of the opposition. That's what happened.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of whether it can it be done, they say, 'When a bill comes from the Senate, normally the minister stands up and puts it on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>.' Yes, they do because normally it's a government bill. But we have in the chamber right now the Leader of the Greens, the member for Melbourne, who, I remember, a couple of terms ago stood up and moved what the Manager of Opposition Business had been invited to move by the Speaker, which is simply that it be made an order of the day. Then, having moved it, you have carriage of it. And the second reading speech was then given by the member for Melbourne. That approach, which, if you check with the clerks, you read your procedure and you learn your rules, has happened in the past. And, as I say, of the 151 members of the parliament, not everyone's expected to do, but I'm probably expected to, and the Manager of Opposition Business is probably expected to. It doesn't happen when it's a government bill because of course when it's a government bill the minister's going to stand up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the first bill today, I did stand up and take it. But the Manager of Opposition Business had a problem with that and now apparently also has a problem when the opposite occurs. But it certainly never occurred to me that we would end up, when the second message came, with a long moment of silence where nothing happened. So we're going through a process now where we're going to end up with, of the four bills, none of them on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> simply because of the—I won't use the noun, because that'd be unparliamentary—idiocy of the way this has been handled by the Manager of Opposition Business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the bill that's in front of us, there were some important issues made by the Deputy Manager of Opposition Business about what the view of first responders would be. We've had evidence on that both publicly and to the Senate inquiry. When you think about who first responders are, what this part of the closing loopholes bill does is acknowledge that, for first responders, PTSD can be presumed. If you've got PTSD, you shouldn't have to then go and prove it's because of your job. In the nine years that I was in opposition, I have no recollection of the government of the day doing anything in this area. Now they claim to be very passionate about it. If they're willing to support those parts of the closing loopholes bill when we get to the closing loopholes bill, that's great.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is also a concern of first responders that they don't only want this dealt with; they also want to avoid some of the forms of trauma. They also want the sections of this bill that deal with road safety, which make it safer for gig economy workers on the roads and make it safer for transport drivers for the road section. You don't just say, 'Oh, let's just presume you're all going to get PTSD because you're going to be turning up to those horrific accidents.' Let's also deal with the parts of the legislation that say, 'Let's avoid that.' Similarly, there's nothing more traumatic for first responders than when they turn up to a workplace death. That's why people want to keep the section of the bill, in exactly this context, that deals with industrial manslaughter, because if it's a crime to cause someone's death out of work it should be a crime to cause someone's death at work. But somehow that one's not urgent. You can't separate those issues from the PTSD issue. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the view of different first responder organisations? We got told before, 'All the first responders would just want this pulled out and dealt with.' Well, I'll tell you that's not the case. Scott Weber, CEO of the Police Federation of Australia—which I would have thought would, as an organisation representing the different state police federations, have a reasonable idea about what a whole lot of first responders think—said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill needs to get up in its entirety … It's critically important this legislation go through in its entirety and quite soon …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Police Federation of Australia doesn't cover the Federal Police, so what does Alex Caruana, the president of the AFP Association, say? 'We support the bill in its entirety.' What did we have in evidence? Simone Haigh, a working paramedic and president of the Ambulance Employees Sub Branch of the Health and Community Services Union Tasmania—listen to this one—said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We see that the whole bill needs to go through together, not just separating us out for presumptive PTSD legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If those opposite are serious in their speeches in caring at all about how this will affect frontline workers, they should look at what the organisations that represent them have said. They should look at the simplicity of the concept of wanting to make sure that you have a situation where you avoid horrific accident sites and turn up to fewer of them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If those organisations are against dealing with these provisions separately, what are the organisations that are in favour? The Business Council of Australia, the Minerals Council of Australia, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Australian Industry Group and Master Builders Australia. How many of them had, in advance, called for this PTSD provision? I hadn't been lobbied about it. How many of that list of organisations had called for silica to be added to the role of the asbestos agency? It wasn't there. How many of them were willing—until they thought, 'Maybe we can say, "Split the bill," and that's a way of delaying it'—to call for anything other than the defeat of the bill in its entirety? There's a really simple reason for that. This bill addresses underpayment. It addresses people being underpaid, whether they're underpaid through the labour hire loophole or because they're in the gig economy with no minimum standards or because they are victims of wage theft. Those organisations all have people who pay their membership to help keep the wages bill low. It's part of their job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So why are they suddenly supporting this? Is it because they're desperate to quickly see through provisions that they have never once in their history supported? No, and no-one thinks that's the case. This is a device, in the same way Senator Cash straightaway got behind the idea of splitting the bill: because they think that if they do this then next year they can argue, 'Oh, we've dealt with the urgent bits and we can keep putting this on for delay after delay after delay.' The original delay that the opposition called for was until October. The next delay they called for was until as late as February. Now they're saying 'no earlier than February'. There will be a further delay because, as long as there is any prospect of people being paid properly, the Liberal and National parties have a problem with it. When they were in government, we had wage theft legislation in front of the parliament. It was introduced by them, and they voted down their own provisions. This is another device to protect underpayment for workers. People know exactly what it is, and, outside of this room, in the little meetings that they have, those opposite know exactly what this is as well, because not one of them has ever called for any of these provisions prior to them being introduced by this government. They don't believe this is urgent. It's another delaying game and should be opposed.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">Mr Burke:</span>
                  </a>  I appreciate the first two suspensions were dealing a matter before the House. We're now dealing with suspensions for matters the House had an opportunity to deal with and chose not to. It might not be this one, but at some point do we get to the point where continued suspensions one after the other start to be seen as frivolous? I don't know if that discretion is within the chair or not. I've not seen an occasion where we've had three suspensions in a row before. I suspect we might get to four. I don't know if we're going to be here all day with continued suspensions, but there is a point when, particularly now we're dealing with something that was before the House earlier today and the Manager of Opposition Business chose to not deal with—to be dealing with suspensions of standing orders the House decided to not deal with this very day is starting to seem pretty extreme.</span>
              </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr FLETCHER:</span>
                  </a>  On the point of order, Speaker, I acknowledge suspensions of standing orders are not to be moved lightly. I think the case for this suspension of standing orders to be moved is a very strong one because, when you announced the message that the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Strengthening Protections Against Discrimination) Bill 2023 had been returned from the Senate, at that point there was complete silence. I think it was entirely reasonable for the opposition and indeed all parliamentarians to expect that at that time the Leader of the House would do exactly as he did with the first bill that was the subject of a message coming from the other house. At that point he stood to move that the second reading be made an order of the day for the next sitting, and it was in reliance on that expectation that the opposition did not immediately jump. I can inform the House it's the opposition's intention to move this suspension of standing orders and one further suspension of standing orders. This suspension of standing orders relates to the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Strengthening Protections Against Discrimination) Bill 2023.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="53517" type="MemberInterjecting">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">The SPEAKER:</span>
                  </a>  I'll rule on the point of order. Whilst I appreciate the work of the House and the leader's point, it looks like we're going back in time in dealing with things the House has dealt with. I will allow the suspension to continue. But I understand there are other matters before the House, and I just ask, where possible, that we expedite the work of the House as quickly as possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr FLETCHER:</span>
                  </a>  Certainly the opposition is always eager to engage in a constructive fashion to expedite the work of the House. Indeed the very substance of this suspension of standing orders motion gives effect to that objective of the opposition, because the motion that is before the House would, if passed, allow the order of the day for the consideration of the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Strengthening Protections Against Discrimination) Bill 2023 to be called on immediately.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me just for the benefit of members remind us of the context in which the House is considering this matter. Four bills were passed by the Senate last week. They deal with a range of matters going to the safety, rights and position of workers under the industrial relations framework. The opposition was pleased to support those bills in the Senate, and it was certainly our expectation, as I think it would be the expectation of any reasonable Australian looking at these facts and circumstances, that there would similarly have been an opportunity to bring these matters on for debate and have them voted on immediately this afternoon. The government could very readily have done that, and we could have by now indeed have dealt with all four of them. By doing that we could have materially advanced the position in relation to the rights of workers in circumstances where they're being made redundant from a business which is eligible for the small business redundancy exemption in circumstances which I think are widely agreed to be inappropriate—that is to say, it's managed to come under the threshold by virtue of insolvency. We would have materially advanced the rights and position of workers who are in the very difficult position of having been subject to domestic violence, with that potentially impacting the way that they are dealt with in a workplace context. We would have materially advanced the position of workers who are at risk of silicosis, and we would have materially advanced the position of first responders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because of what the Senate has done in passing four bills addressing these four matters, which are uncontentious, uncontroversial and supported by the opposition and, indeed, by the government—as is evident from the many passionate speeches that have been given and from the fact that they're included in a bill that the government has brought forward—and, as I am advised, by many on the crossbench, we could have dealt with these matters very quickly and efficiently. But, rather confusingly, what the government has chosen to do is reject this opportunity to deal promptly with these matters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What the opposition is seeking to do, in each of the suspension of standing orders motions that we have moved, is to give all members of this House the opportunity to vote in a way that indicates whether or not they're supportive of bringing these matters on so that affected workers can have their position improved immediately. That is the reason the opposition is moving this particular suspension of standing orders, just as it is the reason that we have moved the other suspensions and intend to move one further suspension of standing orders: because it is important that members of this House have the opportunity to vote on these bills. These bills are before us. They could be considered immediately. They were considered and dealt with very rapidly in the Senate, and the opposition certainly believes that there is an opportunity here in the House to deal with these matters very rapidly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The specific bill that is the subject of this suspension of standing orders motion deals with the problem of family and domestic violence. Under existing arrangements in the Fair Work Act, an employee who is subjected to family and domestic violence is not necessarily protected from employer adverse action within the workplace unless it is connected to the exercise of the employee's workplace rights or it can be argued to be protected by another attribute such as sex. The fact that an employee has been subject to family and domestic violence, therefore, could be a source of discrimination within the workforce—for example, resulting in a reduction of work hours or a demotion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The very sound policy reasons as to why this matter needs to be dealt with as quickly as possible are undoubtably what motivated the Senate to pass a bill which had the effect of taking these uncontroversial provisions, which are widely supported across the political spectrum, and putting them into a standalone bill. That's now been passed by the Senate, and there's an opportunity for the House to vote on that bill as well. That is certainly something that we in the opposition would be supportive of. It is for that reason that I have moved the suspension of standing orders in the way that I have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again I make the point that if the Leader of the House had conducted himself in accordance with the reasonable expectation on the part of all members, having regard to the words he caused to be included in the daily program, then this less direct method would not have been necessary. But, the circumstances being as they are, this is the next best option for the House. I commend, therefore, this motion for suspension of standing orders to the House.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="218019" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HOGAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Page</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:48</span>):  I stand to second the motion to suspend standing orders. The minister at times raises very valid points about process, conventions and standing orders in relation to what's happened today. Some of the things that he raised, I'm sure, are very relevant. I'm sure he will also say, as he did when we moved the previous suspension of standing orders, that the workers want all of the elements of the bill passed. In relation to the PTSD provisions, he said that the workers not only want that but also want all elements of the larger omnibus bill, the closing loopholes bill, to be passed. He may well be correct with some first responders; he may not be correct with other first responders, but I take the point.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister may also raise the point: 'It's all well and good that you think it was important, but you didn't do it.' You could say that about any new government in relation to any bill that they bring forward. To compliment the minister on his point that we didn't do it—good point—but we support the minister in what he's trying to do in certain elements of this bill. On this element of the bill—strengthening protections against discrimination—we support him. He may well say that the people who are supportive of that part of the bill want the whole of the bill supported. What is blatantly clear, and I think the minister has almost said this publicly, is that the whole of this bill is going to be a multi-month process that is going to take us well into next year. The Senate have already reflected that with the way they've broadcast how they're going to treat this bill when it gets there. What we have had is good news. What we've had in the last week or so is good news from the Senate, saying that they are going to support four elements of the bill without amendment. They're happy with how the minister has constructed and drafted it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Strengthening Protections Against Discrimination) Bill 2023 is one of those. I'll reiterate what that part of the bill is. It adds the experience of family and domestic violence to the protected attributes for discrimination of employment. We agree with that. I know we didn't do it, but we agree with it. Well done to the minister for bringing it forward into his larger omnibus bill. We agree with this, as the Senate has reflected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I would say to the minister on process, practices and standing orders is that he may well be correct on some of those, but not on others. I acknowledge his points about the processes of the parliament. I acknowledge that no other previous government, including previous Labor governments, has done this. He has brought through four areas, including this one about discrimination. We acknowledge that and we support that. I would say, as I have about the other bills that we've looked at today, that the people in the community who may be affected by such discrimination in their workplace would be, I think, willing the government—those people may want the whole of the bill to go through; they may not—to put this through today. What that means, like the other four aspects, is that if this legislation went through today, people who need this protection within their workplace won't have to wait for many months. They won't have to wait until we see how the larger omnibus bill goes through the Senate, and other things, next year, which will be protracted and take a long time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask the minister to look at this as a goodwill gesture. It might not look like it as far as parliamentary process goes, but I ask him to look at it as a goodwill gesture, because this means that the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Strengthening Protections Against Discrimination) Bill 2023 could go through this House today and bring in these protections for the relevant workers.</span>

                  <a href="DYW" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Watson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Minister for the Arts and Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:53</span>):  I have a few things. First of all, I don't think the motion that's been moved will be carried, so this may not have an impact. Even if carried, it would potentially have no effect because what the Manager of Opposition Business has moved is to suspend standing orders that would prevent the order of the day for the consideration of the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Strengthening Protections Against Discrimination) Bill 2023 being called on immediately.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why, if that were carried, would it have no effect? There is no order of the day. He's described it as an order of the day in the motion. At the end of my speech, we will vote on that. I don't think it will be carried, so it won't actually matter, and certainly not carried by an absolute majority. But if it were to be carried, I'm not sure what we'd do, because it refers to bringing on an order of the day that doesn't exist. Not only does the order of the day not exist today; because the Manager of Opposition Business has handled this today in a way that no Manager of Opposition Business has handled these issues in the history of the parliament, none of these four bills will be on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> for tomorrow either or for the day after. When he says 'the normal process', where the Leader of the House would often stand up and take the call: what would happen would be that Christopher Pyne would be here and I'd be over there, and we'd both be jumping trying to get the call at the same time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">Mr Chester:</span>
                  </a>  The good old days!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DYW" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BURKE:</span>
                  </a>  Yes, it was fun! They were fun debates. I'm glad Christopher is no longer in this job but I am sad he is no longer in the parliament; I'll acknowledge that!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We'd both jump because, if you jumped and you got to be the one to move that it be made an order of the day, that meant you had carriage of the bill—so we'd each want that. Christopher would usually jump and be first, as Leader of the House, and he'd get the call, and then it'd go onto the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> under government business. The only person who beat him was not me jumping from there; it was the member for Melbourne jumping from up there, on the anticorruption commission private members' bill that came across. As a result, the second reading speech came on for debate and the second reading was moved by the member for Melbourne.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am struggling to work out how we got here, because I'm not sure anyone other than the current Manager of Opposition Business could have achieved this one. He complained we could have dealt with this quickly. Well, we spent an hour and a half on speeches being made by opposition members about why this had to be dealt with quickly, and, because the full hour and a half was used up, the question didn't get put at all. I didn't make the Manager of Opposition Business do that. The opposition members looked really proud they were holding all this up. What they were holding up was that first message ever making it onto the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In those speeches they complained about the motion I had moved. So, the second time, I didn't come into the chamber to move a motion, presuming that what would probably happen is what used to happen with Christopher Pyne and myself ready to jump, and that the opposition would jump. They didn't. There was a long pause. No-one jumped. As a result, the second of the messages, the second bill, will never appear on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>. I did not make that happen. Ordinarily, any Manager of Opposition Business would jump and would move the resolution. If you check with the clerks in advance or if you check on the blue—he has been quoting this—the motion to move that the second reading be made an order of the day for the next sitting is there; what you have to move is actually there. But the Manager of Opposition Business, on the second message, didn't move anything, so the second bill doesn't get on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We then had a long period of points of order between the Manager of Opposition Business and myself. During that long period of points of order back and forth, you, Mr Speaker, made it clear to the Manager of Opposition Business what he would have to move and what the procedure was. Had he moved that, the bill would be on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> tomorrow and there would be an order of the day, and it would be possible in subsequent days, if they wanted to put pressure on the government, to move to bring on this bill that was on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> that was an order of the day, and they'd be able to list what number it was and the suspension and have the debate to put pressure on the government. He was specifically told by you, Mr Speaker, what he had to move. But he gets a rush of blood to the head and instead moves a suspension of standing orders. So he gets to have the vote and the debate but he could have moved what the Speaker had said, got it onto the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> and then moved the suspension, and the bill would have remained in front of the House on an ongoing basis through the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>. But then, during the whole 25 minutes of that suspension debate and the period for the division, there was no moment where the Manager of Opposition Business checked what the impact of this particular tactic was. So the third one doesn't get on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All he had to do to get the fourth message, the fourth bill, onto the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper </span>was say out loud the words that are on the blue that had been suggested by the Speaker. What does the Manager of Opposition Business do? He stands up and moves another suspension. So we end up with a situation where you have four private member's bills that come from the Senate to here, and, through actions entirely within the agency of the Manager of Opposition Business, where all he had to do was read out loud the dozen or so words that were there printed in front of him—he refused to do that and made sure that, as far as the procedures of the House are concerned, after today, none of these bills are before the House. The only way for them to be introduced is to put one forward for private member's business and give notice of it, and I guess it comes up in private member's business on the Monday when we're back after next week off. Why anyone would do this, I have no idea.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am regretful to some members of the crossbench that approached me in good faith about moving suspensions on this issue. I always give honest procedural advice when asked questions like that. I said the logical time to move a suspension would be the following day because then you've got it on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>. What never occurred to me when I was talking to the crossbench about waiting until the second day was that there would be no second day; that the Manager of Opposition Business would take all the work that Senator Cash had done in the Senate and refuse to follow procedure for any one of the four bills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So now we're going through one suspension after the other to be able to have a debate so he can tell his side he fought the good fight—even though the only reason this has been stuffed up completely is that the Manager of Opposition Business decided to wing it on the first time this term that private member's bills make it across from the Senate. It's a big deal when this happens. It doesn't happen that often. You go to the Clerk, you talk to the Speaker, you read the procedure, you work out the rules and you don't make a mess of it. Now the only thing he will have achieved is wasting an hour and a half this morning and I don't know how long this afternoon, when we could have been debating the bill that was already before the House that deals with these exact provisions and getting that done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a long speaking list. Having lost this time, I advise the House now that I'll be putting something on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> for us to have some extra nights to make sure we fit everybody in. I won't be cutting the speaking time, but I'm going to have to provide extra time for the House because we basically have wasted a day because four messages that could have been dealt with in about five minutes have instead been catapulted from the Senate to here and then to oblivion by the design, for reasons I will never understand, of the Manager of Opposition Business. That's where we are. The government will vote against this suspension, although, as I said, even if it were carried, it refers to an order of the day that does not exist.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Small Business Redundancy Exemption) Bill 2023 being called on immediately, and debate on the question that the amendment moved by the Manager of Opposition Business, that the bill be considered immediately, continuing.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have seen today is repeated attempts by this government to avoid dealing with bills that have come from the Senate. We have four bills that have come from the Senate. The first of these was the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Small Business Redundancy Exemption) Bill 2023. The opposition believes that this bill ought to be brought on immediately so that it can be debated as quickly as possible and voted upon. The reason we believe that this is necessary is that the matters within this bill are matters that are not contentious. They are agreed. They're certainly supported by the government, as is evident from the fact that they're included in the governments so-called closing loopholes bill. They are supported by the opposition. They are supported, I'm advised, by many of the crossbench, and, of course, they were supported by the Senate, which has moved and passed this bill. There is an opportunity before this House to proceed, bring this matter forward and vote upon it. That is what the opposition believes ought to happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe that ought to happen for all of the reasons that have been argued by the Leader of the House and by Labor members in various speeches within this place and externally when they've spoken about the importance of this legislation, the small business redundancy exemption bill. We've seen repeated attempts by this government and by the Leader of the House to avoid this House dealing with these bills. We've had a host of explanations from him as to why it's not his responsibility and why he shouldn't have put his hand on the tiller to move that the House deal with this bill. These are matters which could be and should be dealt with by this House immediately. That would be entirely consistent with the bills passed by the Senate, and it would be consistent with what I'd suggest Australians expect people in this House to do where there is agreement between the government, the opposition and crossbenchers—in this case on matters dealing with the circumstances of employees of historically large businesses which by reason of insolvency, under effectively a technical provision as it exists today, fall within the scope of the small business redundancy arrangements. Presently the position under the law is that employers in those circumstances are able to take advantage of a provision which deals with redundancy for employees of smaller businesses. I think it is widely accepted across the parliament that this is a technicality. I think it is widely accepted across the parliament that this is a provision or this is a circumstance in which the ordinary redundancy provisions ought to apply and the small business redundancy exemption, which is there for a particular set of circumstances, ought not to apply.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The critical thing is we could move to deal with this now, and that is what the opposition is seeking to do. We've been given an opportunity by the Senate in relation to this set of bills that have come across to the House. It's transparently and abundantly clear the government does not want to consider these matters quickly. But it is the opposition's view and, as I understand is evident from voting patterns, the view of a number of the crossbenchers as well that this matter should be dealt with quickly, and we have an opportunity to do that. Indeed we believe on the side of the chamber we have a responsibility to act quickly. For these reasons the opposition is moving this suspension of standing orders motion, just as we moved a series of other motions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe the appropriate act for the House would be to support this motion so we can suspend standing orders and resume debate on the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Small Business Redundancy Exemption) Bill 2023. We can bring that on immediately, and we can vote on that immediately, before Christmas—for people employed who, as the law presently stands, face the risk that, due to circumstances outside of their control, where they would ordinarily have available redundancy provisions in the general industrial relations legislation, those provisions would not apply, because of the very technical operation of the small business exemption. It's widely accepted that exemption ought not to operate in the specific circumstances where a historically large business, where the normal redundancy provisions would apply, has managed to fall under the small business provisions by virtue of insolvency, so we can act now to deliver that greater certainty to employees around Australia. The government has completely failed to explain why it doesn't want to bring this on now, and this is a chance for the government to do this. It's a chance for the parliament to legislate in a way the Senate already has legislated, to pass this bill, therefore I commend this motion to the House.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HOGAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Page</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:19</span>):  I second the motion. A lot has been said. We have three precedents for this. So I want to go through a couple of points that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has made in relation to when we've done this three times prior. He has made points about practices in this chamber, process and procedure in this chamber and standing orders in this chamber. He may or may not be correct about some of the points he's made, but I take the point that this could've been dealt with in different ways. There are different processes and procedures. There are lots of different ways that these bills that have been sent back as private members' bills from the Senate may well have been dealt with. I hear that. I'm sure that's true. When we got into the detail of what the bills were dealing with, he said, 'If you were so passionate about this, why didn't you do it when you were in government?' On the bill relating to people in the Pacific islands that we're looking at, the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Small Business Redundancy Exemption) Bill 2023, he said, 'I think those people want the whole omnibus bill passed, not just sections one at a time.' He may or may not be right about that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Putting all that to one side—forgetting how the different procedures, practices and standing orders of this chamber could have dealt with this, forgetting about what previous governments have or haven't done in relation to this legislation and putting aside whether people who are affected by these four bills that have come back today do or don't want the whole legislation to go through—the one thing that is factual, the one thing we can agree on right now, is that if the government were to support these four individual bills to go through this chamber today they could. That's the bottom line. All the rest, in some ways, is semantics. We could talk about how the chamber dealt with this and what the processes, procedures and standing orders say and what the Manager of Opposition Business should have done. That is all by the by. What previous governments did is by the by. Right now, we have four private members' bills that have come back from the Senate. The government could support those and they could be implemented all but immediately. Those four elements of the larger closing the loopholes omnibus bill could happen right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister's also previously mentioned that this has been presumptuous because when IR legislation goes to the Senate there are always amendments and references to committees. Do you know what? That chamber has said—as we have in this chamber today—they could move through those four parts of the omnibus bill today with no amendments but exactly how the minister first wrote them up and wanted to legislate them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's put all the processes, procedures and standing orders aside. Yes, there are different ways that this could be treated. But, at the end of the day, the issue is this. The opposition today came into this chamber saying, 'We are willing to debate and to support these four bills and pass them in this chamber today.' These four bills were all drafted by the minister. They have all passed as private members' bills through the Senate. That's happened there. So the minister has four elements of a larger bill that he could take through this chamber today. I've said this before, but I would again say to the minister on this one about a redundancy exemption that ensures that employees do not miss out on redundancy payments merely because of their employer that the people who are affected by this would like the government to pass this today. They don't care how the Manager of Opposition Business introduced it or what's happened with the processes of the parliament. They would like this to pass today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people who are affected by the asbestos issue in that particular bill would like it to pass today. Those people who may well be discriminated against in the workplace because of domestic violence would like that specific amendment bill to pass through today. For those who are first responders, that particular bill affects their lives. They are not into what 90 per cent of this debate has been about. They are not into the parliamentary processes, the standing orders or the procedures we are debating here. They are not into that. They are into: 'Okay. Great! The opposition and some crossbenchers have said they're prepared to support four elements of the government's bill, and some of them affect me. That's great. That's going to save six or seven or eight months, and that bill will change my life quicker than it otherwise would be.' And that's why I'm seconding this motion.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Watson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Minister for the Arts and Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:25</span>):  It's not the most effective afternoon in the House, but here we are. To go through it once again, I'll deal with the procedural issues quickly and then I want to say a bit more about the substance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the procedural issues: if the opposition wanted to deal with these issues quickly, why did you filibuster this morning? Why? If you actually wanted to deal with these quickly, why did you spend an hour and a half making speeches about when we would debate it? Why? I didn't get to declare the government's position on the amendment, because to declare the government's position—because I was the mover of the motion—would have wound up the debate. I did try to stand up earlier in the debate, and opposition members were still wanting to speak, so I went and sat down, and then they kept going for an hour and a half, and, as a result, that question never got resolved. If you were serious about wanting to deal with this quickly, would you have designed to filibuster and waste as much time as possible, with people giggling about how clever this was?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition have treated this like a game all day. That's what they've done. They haven't done their homework—they haven't bothered—with something happening for the first time this term, on a private members' bill coming through like this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can tell you: if there had been a Greens party bill that had made it through, I can guarantee the Greens party would have been onto the right procedures when it reached the House, if a private member's bill that had been moved by one of their senators had made it through. I know they would have, because I've seen them do it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In opposition, we had occasions where we were in the same situation, and, as I said, Christopher Pyne and I would be jumping to try to see who'd get carriage of it. That's because you want it to be something that you can make sure you give a second reading speech to. You want to be able to do the advocacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But if there was any sincerity in wanting to deal with these issues quickly, why was there a filibuster this morning? A whole lot of people in the chamber right now were roped into being part of it. I don't know whose decision it was, but it all happened without there being any response by the government, because I didn't want to be in a situation of closing off debate. Was it a game where people thought it would be funny—'Let's see if we can get him to move that the question be put'? Is that what it was? Was this entire thing just a game, as far as the opposition is concerned? This is an issue that they have never cared about. As to this one in particular that's in front of us right now, this hangs off another provision, because this is about discrimination not occurring, and we don't have any examples of this having occurred yet, but it's about making sure that no-one is discriminated against, in relation to family and domestic violence leave being there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, paid family and domestic violence leave is only law. The call for it had been around for more than a decade, and we'd started, when we were last in office; we hadn't got there. The call had got really loud during the nine years intervening. Those opposite never moved on it. And now we're meant to believe that suddenly they think these provisions are urgent? It's a tiny area of discrimination that hangs off provisions that they held back their entire time in office. Is that what we're meant to believe?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You see, we had a line from the Manager of Opposition Business—and I wrote it down, so it mightn't be quite verbatim, but I think it's pretty close. He said: 'We've seen repeated attempts by the government to prevent these bills from being debated.' The prevention of the bills being debated has been all of his own making, because, if he'd done what the leader of the Greens party had previously done, or if he'd done what I'd tried to do when Christopher Pyne was here, then he would have made sure that the debate could at least occur in the House. But he did none of that. The opposition played, this morning, what can only be described as a game. Then, when given direct instruction from the Speaker about how to make sure that it ended up with debate, they refused to do it and just went to suspensions. That's what they've done. But I think the best evidence—and I don't know who's going to tell Senator Cash what's happened today—</span>

                  </a>  Can you let me know what time of day it happens, because I want to be in the corridor! The person who speaks on behalf of Senator Cash on legislation issues is the Manager of Opposition Business, so he spoke. The opposition gets the first speech in response, and they get the half-hour. He used 20 minutes of the half-hour, so he used pretty much all of it. Guess how many references he made to any of the four issues that they're now saying are urgent? Not one!</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BURKE:</span>
                  </a>  Zero! So now they're coming back claiming that this is urgent from their perspective, claiming a passion and goodwill! And, when they were asked to talk about the legislation, they could find 28 minutes and there was not a single reference to any of the provisions that we're talking about now. Not one! It is unparliamentary to use the word 'hypocrite'. It is not an parliamentary to refer to hypocrisy, and we are witnessing hypocrisy on steroids right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The question then, though, is, why would they want to split the bill? Of course they haven't split the bill, because the bill's still here, and we probably won't get to debate it today because we've wasted all this time. That's probably what will happen. So the net impact of this entire game will be: we'll have a couple of late nights the next couple of nights to get through the speeches because we had all of these suspensions, not because procedurally they were going to get anywhere but because the Manager of Opposition Business felt he needed some cover for the monumental stuff-up that he participated in. So, if you're one of the people who gets rostered on for the 10 pm slot over the next couple of nights, remember this moment, because it's the only reason it's going to happen. If you look at the number of people on the speaking lists and the time that we were planning to set aside for the week, it was all there. For all the talk of 'Will there be a gag motion?' and 'What will happen?', we haven't gagged a vote, we haven't reduced speaking times and we've been making sure that these provisions all get to be discussed and discussed properly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue that comes up—and I respect that the Deputy Manager of Opposition Business has raised this a couple of times—is the issue of amendments, as though somehow it would be a victory for me and why don't I want to get the bill through in the exact form. Senate inquiries can improve legislation. They are often do, particularly on provisions like this. And I might say some of the people in the Senate who voted for these private members' bills are also negotiating with me about amendments to the provisions in the main bill. They don't want them to go through in this form either. Evidence has been brought to the Senate committee on each of these four bills about how some of the different provisions need to be tweaked to have maximum effect. As the Leader of the House, I probably let the House down—I don't knock the Senate as much as most of my predecessors did. I'm more respectful. That might just be because Senator Wong is the leader over there and it's just a smarter course of action.</span>

                  </a>  But I don't bag the Senate. Maybe it's because I was briefly in an upper house in the state parliament. But the process of an inquiry, particularly on a bill like this—of getting stakeholders to make submissions, of getting cross-party conversation to say what amendments might improve things here and then to get the report and to make amendments as a result—does land you in better legislation. And the Senate inquiry was probably pretty close to ready to report. If you look at their hearing schedule, they may well have been able to report next week. They probably could have. Why will they not? Because the Liberal and National parties voted that they are not allowed to. Even if they are ready to report, they are not allowed to, and they're not allowed to because those opposite changed the rule from 'report by 1 February' to 'must not report before 1 February'. That looks to me like a delaying tactic. It looks like this entire charade is nothing but a delaying tactic for the opposition. I don't have that view of why Senator Lambie has participated in it or why Senator Pocock or Senator Tyrrell have participated in it. But I'll tell you what: it's exactly why Senator Cash was all over it. It's exactly why the Liberal Party and the National Party were suddenly all in on provisions they had never supported and, when they had a chance to debate the bill, provisions they never referenced. What do they want to delay? They want to delay legislation that will close loopholes and make sure people are paid properly. With everything that is happening with cost of living at the moment, that will never be our position.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The trial of David McBride has commenced just a few short kilometres from here in the ACT Supreme Court. David McBride, a brave whistleblower, could not stand by while he had evidence of crimes committed by Australian Defence Force personnel in Afghanistan. But nobody would listen to him. Nobody in his chain of command would act. No-one would commence an investigation into the evidence David McBride had that a group of Australian soldiers had committed war crimes in Afghanistan. He followed the correct processes. He went through the chain of command in the ADF and had every door shut on him. Eventually his sense of duty led him to blow the whistle and tell the media and the public what had happened. Whistleblowers like David are essential to our democracy and in holding our governments and institutions to account. Think of the robodebt scandal and how whistleblowers were silenced, or Richard Boyle, who blew the whistle on appalling practices in the ATO and is being prosecuted despite been vindicated by a Senate inquiry and an internal ATO inquiry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After blowing the whistle on Australian war crimes in Afghanistan and being vindicated by the Brereton report, which found evidence of dozens of war crimes committed by Australian special forces, it is David McBride, the whistleblower, who is in court today being prosecuted by the government. There is one person who can stop this. That person is the Labor Attorney-General. The Attorney-General has the power to end this with a single pen stroke using section 71 of the Judiciary Act. With a flick of his pen the Attorney-General could end the prosecution of David McBride, who faces the very real prospect of years in jail simply for telling the public the truth about war crimes. While David McBride is facing trial today, not a single member of the ADF who committed the war crimes has been brought to trial. There is one pending prosecution, but the first person to face trial, the first person to face jail, is not one of those who committed the war crimes but the whistleblower. Someone needs to riddle me that. There are clearly exceptional circumstances here where our country's whistleblowing laws have proven incapable of protecting David McBride. The Attorney-General has admitted Australia's whistleblowing laws are broken and do not protect genuine whistleblowers, so why let David McBride suffer? What does Australia stand for when we have compelling evidence of troops committing war crimes and the person we prosecute is the whistleblower?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWG" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DREYFUS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Isaacs</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Attorney-General and Cabinet Secretary</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:47</span>):  Standing orders should not be suspended. All of us in this House have an obligation to the administration of justice, and this motion is not appropriate in the context of a criminal trial which started today in the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, where a jury will be empanelled this week. To repeat, this is a jury trial. Of all the matters ministers should speak on, a current criminal trial is not one of them. As everyone in this place should know, to do so carries the substantial risk of prejudicing a proceeding before a court. As Mr McBride's proceeding remains ongoing, it would be wholly inappropriate for me to comment, and I will not be commenting on the particulars of that matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I am happy to make some comments about the prosecution process in Australia. The Attorney-General of the Commonwealth does not conduct prosecutions. One of the most important features of our criminal justice system is that the decision to prosecute is a matter for the independent Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. The Attorney-General's power to discontinue a prosecution that has been commenced by the independent Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions is an extraordinary power that should be exercised only in extraordinary circumstances. Clearly, that has been the view of every Commonwealth Attorney-General since Federation, given that the power in section 71 of the Judiciary Act has been exercised only once in 120 years. I'll say that again: the power in section 71 of the Judiciary Act has been exercised only once in 120 years. That might be a little hint to you about the exceptional circumstances that might be required.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Generally, the only time that the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth will be involved in the prosecution process is when a law specifically requires the Attorney-General to consent to a prosecution in order for it to proceed. There are a small number of laws which require the Attorney-General's consent, in addition to the decision being made by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to commence a prosecution. That's for a very good reason. It is vital to the administration of justice in Australia that the prosecution process is, and is seen to be, largely independent of the political arena, and we should all be thankful for that. We should be thankful that, in Australia, the prosecution process is largely independent of the political arena.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I invite all of those on the crossbench to contemplate this: if the Commonwealth Attorney-General intervened in a prosecution as a result of public or political pressure, that could have a range of far-reaching consequences. It could call into question the Attorney-General's motives. It could politicise the prosecution process. It could undermine the independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions. So any suggestion—and it's the implication of this motion that is now before the House—that an attorney-general should intervene in prosecutions routinely or has some kind of permanent, standing or ongoing supervisory jurisdiction in circumstances that are not truly exceptional should be strongly resisted. That's why the standing orders should not be suspended. I will say this, too, about the process of reform on whistleblowers. In relation to law reform, the government is delivering on its commitment to ensure that Australia has effective frameworks to protect whistleblowers. This work is critical to supporting integrity in the rule of law.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a very longstanding personal interest in this. I was the Attorney-General and Special Minister of State in 2013 who brought to this House the Commonwealth's first legislation to protect whistleblowers. It's called the Public Interest Disclosure Act. When we brought that bill before the parliament and had it passed in our last term in government, I wrote into the act a statutory review process in order to ensure that, within two years of that bill becoming law, there would be a review to ensure that it was working as intended. The former failed government, which had no interest in whistleblower protection, of course ignored that statutory review that was conducted by Philip Moss. The Moss review had to wait until our government, which has an interest in whistleblower protection, came to office and picked it up. We have implemented a little over half of the recommendations of the Moss review in a bill that I brought to this parliament last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have, in the Public Interest Disclosure Act, a framework which facilitates and protects disclosures of wrongdoing raised by public officials. Its aim is to promote integrity and accountability in the Commonwealth public sector. On 1 July 2023, the first stage of reform to that system, the Public Interest Disclosure Amendment (Review) Act 2023, commenced and ensured that immediate improvements to the public sector whistleblower scheme were in place when the National Anti-Corruption Commission commenced. It was important to match the commencement of the National Anti-Corruption Commission. The improvements included strengthening protections for disclosures of witnesses, focusing the scheme on integrity wrongdoing, making the scheme easier to administer and enhancing oversight of the scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More specifically, the amendments which commenced on 1 July reinforced the positive duty to protect whistleblowers upon principal officers by requiring them to provide ongoing training and education to public officials in their agency, strengthened protections for whistleblower disclosures and introduced protections including expanding the definition of detriment that will attract remedies. The amendments enhanced the oversight role of the Ombudsman, enhanced the oversight role of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and facilitated the reporting and sharing of information relating to public interest disclosures to ensure that they can be properly addressed. The reforms also improved the allocation and investigation processes for authorised officers and removed solely personal work related conduct from the scope of disclosable conduct. This first stage of reform implemented 21 of the 33 recommendations of the 2016 review by Mr Philip Moss AM. It's another reason why standing orders should not be suspended as sought by the member for Brisbane.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will soon commence a second stage of whistleblower reform to address the underlying complexity of the Public Interest Disclosure Scheme and provide effective and accessible protections to public sector whistleblowers. That'll include consideration of the remaining recommendations of the Moss review, some recent parliamentary reports, some recent external reviews and reports from stakeholders and significant changes to the integrity landscapes since the Public Interest Disclosure Act was introduced, which include, of course, the establishment of the National Anti-Corruption Commission. We are interested in the community's views on what reforms are required to the Public Interest Disclosure Act and to other related measures to ensure the public sector whistleblower framework is fit for purpose. We'll be seeking views on who can make and who within the government can receive disclosures, including a 'no wrong door' referral approach. We'll be seeking views on pathways to make a disclosure outside of government. We'll be seeking views on protections and remedies that are available under the Public Interest Disclosure Act. We'll be seeking views on the function of oversight and integrity agencies and support for whistleblowers, including potential functions of a whistleblower protection authority or commissioner as well as education and training. That's another reason why standing orders should not be suspended.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been a whole range of improvements in recent times to the broader Commonwealth National Integrity Framework, including, of course, the establishment of the National Anti-Corruption Commission, which creates a new avenue for all persons, including public officials, to raise concerns about wrongdoing. Standing orders should not be suspended. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:57</span>):  I rise in support of this standing order motion, and I rise as the elected representative of David McBride, as he is a constituent. The Attorney-General makes the point that we shouldn't have this motion at this point, because the trial is ongoing right now, starting today. I think that is actually the point. Others across the crossbench and I have been making representations about this very issue, the case of David McBride, and also the case of Richard Boyle, for months and months and months, as have many people across civil society and law reform, because this is a critical issue. I pay tribute to the Attorney-General's strong actions on whistleblowers in the past, and I understand his reluctance to intervene. But this is a case of justice that needs to be dealt with, and this is why others and I are standing at this time. David McBride did undertake processes to try and deal with crimes that he had concerns about. He undertook processes to try and get those resolved and dealt with internally, and, when he felt he had nothing else to do, he went to the press. He has stood up for the broader goals of the Australian community. He has taken one for Australia, as opposed to having taken one for the team—in this case, he has taken one for the broader Australian community—and we are better for that. As a country, we are better for his actions, and we are better for the understandings that he brought to this country as a whistleblower.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, he is the man on trial today. Many people have worked tirelessly to avoid this situation, but this is where we are. I think this is a matter of urgency, and this is why I rise in support of this and I rise in support of David McBride, his bravery and what he has stood up for up until this time.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:59</span>):  I rise in support of the member's suspension of standing orders motion for one simple reason: whether or not reform has been fast enough in coming when it comes to the Public Interest Disclosure Act, the reality is that we now have an Australian citizen who, for all intents and purposes, has done what he believes is in the best interests of our country, and yet he finds himself to be under the full attention of our judicial system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To many Australians, including many in my electorate of North Sydney, it makes absolutely no sense that the first person to face criminal prosecution in our country for war crimes in the Afghanistan conflict is actually the person who blew the whistle on them. It makes no sense. It's just not logical. More concerningly, it sends a very chilling message to anybody else currently sitting in a position who is watching the activities of a department or process that they may be involved in and thinking that they need to speak up about this. The message this prosecution sends to those people is: 'Do not, or, if you do, you will face the full weight of the law.' As a civil society that is seeking to progress itself ever forward, one of the things we must commit to is transparency. We must commit to integrity in all of our processes. In this simple case, it's hard not to see David McBride as a pawn in a much bigger political game. That's why I believe it's important that we suspend standing orders today to debate this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I absolutely pay my greatest respects to the Attorney-General. I know this is a passion project of yours, and I know this is an area you are incredibly committed to. I also know, though, that you do have the power to stop this prosecution. The terms under which you can exercise that power are not written in the legislation. It is up to you to decide whether they are extraordinary. I would make the case here that, in this circumstance, just as with Bernard Collaery, these are extraordinary circumstances. David McBride should not be the person on trial today.</span>

David McBride might be on trial today, but he's not the only person or entity on trial in this matter. This government is also on trial. This is a matter in which a whistleblower—and he's acknowledged to be a whistleblower—has drawn attention to crimes committed by representatives of this country, yet it is an egregious and cruel paradox that he is the first person to face trial on this matter. The reality is that these are extraordinary circumstances. The Attorney-General is aware of the fact that he has, as he has before, the power to exercise his unique powers to stop this prosecution.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What members of the House might not know is that David McBride 's father was also a whistleblower. He was the person who brought attention worldwide to the adverse effects of thalidomide. This is a family with a long and proud history of bringing unfortunate and sad events to light. He shouldn't be penalised for his actions in this; he should be lauded. We should be celebrating the actions of a brave man who has taken a personal risk to bring to light events of which we all now are sadly aware. So it is with great strength and with great conviction that I support this motion for the suspension of standing orders</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:03</span>):  I also stand in support of this suspension of standing orders motion. I appreciate that the government has a desire to increase the protection of whistleblowers and has commenced this process. Last year, when the National Anti-Corruption Commission Bill 2022 was being discussed, the crossbench urged the government to improve protections for whistleblowers with a whistleblower protection authority. Some changes have been made to whistleblower protection, but clearly not enough, so we find ourselves in this extraordinary situation with David McBride on trial this week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the Attorney-General's point that his power to intervene should only be applied in exceptional or extraordinary circumstances. It's only been exercised once in 100 years. The question here is really whether these are exceptional circumstances. I think the government finds itself in a difficult position of its own making, because that whistleblower protection wasn't extended last year at the time when the crossbench was pushing for that. This appears to be exceptional. Mr McBride has done everything right: he told the truth, he showed courage and now he's paying the price. Earlier in his defence in the proceedings against him, Mr McBride sought to rely on the Public Interest Disclosure Act to introduce evidence and to defend himself in that prosecution. But the Commonwealth made an application under public interest immunity to prevent that evidence from being introduced in court, which, as Mr McBride has said, made his Public Interest Disclosure Act application and the conduct of his defence impossible. These circumstances are extraordinary, and so I call upon the Attorney-General to intervene because these are extraordinary circumstances, and to assure the Australian people that in our democracy whistleblowers will receive the appropriate protections.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STEGGALL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:05</span>):  I rise in support of this motion to suspend standing orders to call on the government to suspend the criminal prosecution of whistleblower David McBride without delay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This began today in the courts, and it goes to the heart of what many have been calling for over many years in relation to whistleblower protection—that is, to have proper, robust whistleblower protection. David McBride blew the whistle to expose horrible war crimes in Afghanistan. These were crimes done in all our names—in the name of Australia. Those soldiers represented Australia overseas and so we bear a moral responsibility for those crimes. It is also our responsibility to welcome those things being exposed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whistleblowing is an action of last resort. David McBride blew the whistle to expose horrible war crimes in Afghanistan; he is brave and he is not a criminal. Whistleblowers pursue all avenues available. They raise concerns with their superiors and through the administrative process, if you look at the different ways in which it has occurred. They try to do it through internal ways, but when the organisational structures they belong to fail to address those concerns and fail to take action, the moral compass and the ethical dilemma they're faced with in knowing those facts and what must be done means that they take the incredibly brave course of action of blowing the whistle. We all benefit from that, as a society and as Australians. It is not done lightly and it is not done easily; it's a matter of last recourse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To be a whistleblower requires a conscious weighing up of what is morally and ethically required for the public good, and what consequences they may have to bear themselves. Currently, our laws are incredibly and wholly inadequate. I know that the government and the Attorney-General have indicated a willingness to look at these laws but they're taking too long. In the meantime, we have the wrong person on trial. Proper legislation in this space is needed as a matter of urgency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to think of the balance between the public interest and not having vexatious claims raised about the Public Service or departments. It's having people respect the administrative process and due process for raising complaints and concerns—for example, in agencies. It's also about acknowledging that the public interest should never outweigh the public interest of telling the truth and exposing wrongdoing in public life. If not, we will never know what's happening behind closed doors. This puts a veil of secrecy over our Public Service, Defence Force and any other system where we know that whistleblowers have actually done the Australian public a good.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I support this motion to call for intervention by the Attorney-General in this case. I appreciate that it's a matter of exceptional circumstances to intervene in these prosecutions, but those exceptional circumstances are borne out by the fact that these laws are acknowledged to be inadequate and incomplete. So we do have exceptional circumstances for that intervention. It's not something that should be called for as a matter of course; it should only be done in the most rare of circumstances.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="241067" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr COLEMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Banks</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:16</span>):  I've already spoken twice on this bill so I don't propose to speak at length. The opposition broadly supports this bill, which makes sensible changes such that gambling using a traditional credit card, a credit card via a digital wallet or digital currency would be prohibited in the future. We think that is sensible. We note that much of this started in the inquiry led by the member for Fisher back in 2020, which made recommendations which have broadly been adopted by the government. So we broadly support this legislation but we have one amendment before the House at the moment, and this is specifically in clause 15 of the bill. In addition to the methods of paying for gambling which are prohibited by the bill, that clause also states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(d) a method of a kind determined by the Minister by legislative instrument for the purposes of this paragraph</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Basically, that means any means of exchange determined by the minister in the future could be prohibited.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are concerned about that for a number of reasons. Firstly, something of that significance, where we are seeking to restrain Australians on how they use legal currency, is something that generally should come through the parliament. We think, as a point of principle, that's the right way for this to be done. If there is a proposal in the future to ban another form of legal exchange, it should come back to the parliament because it is a significant thing to do to affect the rights of Australians in that way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We particularly note that this is a question of ministerial discretion, so ultimately we must consider the facts before us. Were this to come into place, the Minister for Communications would have that discretion. We're concerned about that in general but particularly concerned given that we have seen, on numerous occasions, failures of judgement by this minister—and that judgement is effectively what comes into play here through clause 15. We have seen that failure of judgement most notoriously in relation to the misinformation bill, where the government has begun the process of walking that back, of delaying the bill, of taking provisions out of the bill because it is, frankly, one of the worst pieces of legislation ever put before this parliament. That was a judgement of the minister because the minister published that legislation, and you don't publish legislation because you think it's a bad idea; you publish legislation because you think it's a good idea. That was the judgement of this minister, so we are anxious about that judgement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also anxious about the judgement, as we said, as it pertains to the Mobile Black Spot Program—a tremendous program created by the coalition, that has helped thousands of Australians to access vital mobile connectivity in regional and rural areas. We saw this minister shamefully politicise this program, with some 74 per cent of sites being allocated to Labor electorates, even though Labor held only a third of seats in rural and regional Australia. It was patently wrong, and so much so that it has really captured the attention of the Auditor-General, who is now very carefully going through all of the facts and all of the information in relation to this program. He said he'll come back by May next year. He is conducting a very thorough and forensic investigation into this very sorry episode relating to the Mobile Black Spot Program. That goes to judgement as, indeed, does the minister's inexplicable decision to fail to implement the eSafety Commissioner's recommendation to implement a trial of age verification software to protect children from dangerous content online. The eSafety Commissioner wanted to do that. The pornography industry doesn't want that to happen. They welcomed the minister's decision not to proceed with that trial, but the minister has been roundly condemned by dozens of experts.</span>

                    </a>  Order! I don't like to interrupt the shadow minister, but this is the detailed amendment stage. He is going around the world. I ask him to refer his remarks specifically to schedule 1, item 15 on page 6, line 24. I've given him some leniency, but the way this works is that we've had the debate, so return to the detailed amendments.</span>

                    </a>  Certainly. The reason that we don't want that clause in this bill is that it gives the minister unfettered discretion. We have no confidence in this minister to exercise unfettered discretion, and that's why we oppose this specific provision, whilst we do welcome the legislation overall.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:21</span>):  As the Speaker may be aware, I didn't get an opportunity to speak on this bill. I will try and confine my remarks to the amendments that's being proposed by the member for Banks—a sensible amendment—but I think it's also important that I give some context, as the author of the report which led to the bill being drafted in the first place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge the government for picking up this report. I was the chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services that undertook the review into this issue because, as you would be aware, you can go to the track, but you can't gamble there using your credit card. If you put your credit card into an ATM at the track, at the TAB, at an RSL or at a surf club, you cannot use your credit card. That is for very good reason. State and territory governments acknowledge that a great deal of harm can be done when people use credit facilities to gamble.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee heard some very concerning, alarming evidence in its inquiry. Approximately $25 billion a year is lost by Australians when they gamble. If people want to gamble with their own money, that's a matter for them, of course. But when they gamble with borrowed money, particularly using a credit card, then they're paying north of 20 per cent interest on that credit card. Once upon a time, when you gambled and lost all your money, you walked out. But now you can use a credit card and you can keep going down; you can keep sinking and you can keep getting further into debt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say that, in terms of the evidence we received, the pushback that I got from the banking sector was just unbelievable, as was the pushback from the gambling sector. Anybody would think you were dealing with big tobacco in the eighties and nineties. They did not acknowledge that this was a problem. In fact, the peak body, Responsible Wagering Australia, changed their position, with a 180-degree turn in relation to the use of credit cards for gambling, the day before they were due to give evidence before the inquiry. So at least they came to their senses, but they had to be dragged, kicking and screaming.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And the banks were worse. The banks told me there was nothing that they could do. They were very cognisant of the damage that was being done in the community, but they refused to lift a finger. I think that that is a great shame. Shame on the banks, and shame on the Banking Association for doing very, very little. I congratulate the government for picking up on this issue, because it is an important issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendment that's proposed by the member for Banks is a very sensible amendment, and I would call upon the government to consider the amendment very closely. The amendment would remove the ability for the minister to determine, by legislative instrument, the ability for a member of the public to use some other form of currency. The amendment is to remove that power. The power that's currently contained within the bill is too broad. It's an overreach, effectively, by the government. The opposition calls upon the government to remove that position. No minister should have the ability to effectively do what the government is empowering the minister to do in this instance. It's overreach. It's quite a folly, in my view.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government wants to do this, it should come back and do it by way of a parliamentary amendment, if and when the opportunity arises. The minister, irrespective of who's sitting in that seat, should never have the ability to just make their own decision on this. It should go through the appropriate parliamentary processes.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Greenway</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Communications</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:27</span>):  The government will not be supporting the amendment moved by the member for Banks in the proposal to remove paragraph 15C(4A)(d) of the Interactive Gambling Amendment (Credit and Other Measures) Bill 2023. When the honourable member has the time, he might want to read the Interactive Gambling Act and note the many other provisions in the act which give the minister discretion to do certain things that are subject to disallowance. When he has finished that, he might want to read the Telecommunications Act and see the same sorts of provisions, right across the sphere, in the communications space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I'm pleased that the member for Fisher has acknowledged that the government has picked up this 2021 report. It is important, because, quite frankly, people should not be betting with money that they do not have. That is the case for land based gambling and it should be the case with gambling online.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Section 15C(4A) of the bill lists the methods of payment that wagering providers would be prohibited from accepting under section 15C of the Interactive Gambling Act. These are credit cards; credit related products, like digital wallets; and digital currencies, such as cryptocurrency, and the provision that will be removed, through the member's amendment, a method determined by the minister by legislative instrument.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Subsection 15C(4A)(d) of the bill would provide the responsible minister with the power to nominate additional payment methods for prohibition, via disallowable instrument. So the notion that this is unfettered is completely wrong. It's a disallowable instrument that is subject to scrutiny. This provision is to make sure that this legislation is able to be responsive to future developments in credit card payment technologies and prevent them from being used to circumvent the bill. This is about closing those loopholes to prevent future harm.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the department undertook targeted consultation on the bill in August, with banking and payment system and wagering and harm reduction stakeholders, as well as Commonwealth, state and territory officials. Stakeholders unanimously supported the bill. I want to be clear that no objections were raised in relation to the proposed minister's power under paragraph 15C(4A)(d).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, the future legislative instrument will receive the normal disallowance scrutiny process to enable the parliament to have oversight of any new payment methods that would be proscribed. The government, along with stakeholders, recognises the importance of this power, in light of the rapidly changing payment, credit and wagering environment. The drafting of the legislative instrument is, as I said, also consistent with various other provisions in the Interactive Gambling Act. These provide the minister with discretionary power to determine certain conditions through legislative instrument, such as section 8A(4), excluded wagering services; section 9A(1), designated country; and section 10A, what is or is not a sporting event.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 14 September, the Senate referred the bill to the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 12 October. The committee's report did not raise any issues in respect of the paragraph raised by the member. In submissions to the inquiry, stakeholders—including Financial Counselling Australia, the Australian Gambling Research Centre, the Australian Institute of Family Studies and the Uniting Church of Australia Synod of Victoria and Tasmania—specifically mentioned their support for the provisions.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments seek to close a loophole that remains in this legislation. The legislation, in substance, bans the use of credit cards and cryptocurrency for online gambling, and I acknowledge this is long overdue. This bill delivers on the government's April commitment and implements recommendation 2 of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. Some 80 per cent of Australians believe gambling with credit cards should be restricted or banned. That is from clear research by the Australian Banking Association. Warringah constituents want to see action taken by all levels of government to reduce gambling harm.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am, I should note, concerned at the slow implementation of recommendations from that joint standing committee and other committees, including those in the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs' aptly named report <span style="font-style:italic;">You win some, you lose more</span> from June 2023. Numerous recommendations came out of that, and we absolutely need a national strategy in cooperation with states and territories. We know that through COVID gambling took on a whole other dimension, and it had a significant impact on communities. We saw a huge increase in online gambling, and the government is only just catching up. So it is really important that, when we are addressing our use of credit cards in relation to gambling, we do so in relation to all forms of gambling, including lotteries, which may lead to addicts engaging with unsecured and small creditors such as payday lenders, pawnbrokers and family members.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is welcome because it prevents people from gambling money on credit—money they do not have. But it fails to close all the loopholes, thus undermining its efficacy. The use of credit cards for online lotteries should also be banned, and this is what these amendments go to. Financial Counselling Australia noted recently:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Lotteries are now operated by corporate giants with multi-million-dollar salaried executives, mega profits and online platforms. They have a slick online marketing model with tickets available 24-7. KenoGO's online lottery offers a draw every three minutes! … KenoGO is showing us the future of lotteries, where it is possible to buy a $20,000 basket or more every day of the week.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Alliance for Gambling Reform echo these sentiments. They also oppose the carve-out for online lotteries, and say the harm from online lottery and keno products is being understated. As outlined in their submission to the Senate committee:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">using credit cards, so it's clear these are still tools for harm. If credit cards are allowed to continue to be used in these instances online, we are still feeding a beast and we are still leading people into to great harm.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amidst a cost-of-living crisis, allowing people to incur further debt via their credit card through online lotteries is a major problem and is frankly irresponsible. Their marketing is compelling. It's drawing people into thinking they will win big—that these will be the lucky tickets. But the odds of winning a division 1 lottery are one in 8,145,060 and the odds of winning a larger keno jackpot are one in 8,911,711, so clearly very long shots. Meanwhile, people are incurring those debts on credit cards and paying high interest rates on those debts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Online lotteries absolutely need to be included in this bill, and I urge the government to support these amendments. I appreciate some are saying the issue is the not-for-profit sector. They rely on the sale of raffle tickets and often use of credit cards, so they are concerned this will curtail their fundraising abilities. But I would say to the minister the problem is that classifying online raffles, for example, in the same category as these big multinational lottos and kenos, with their slick marketing campaigns, is very dangerous. I ask the minister, who is here, to either support these amendments or tell this place and the Australian people what the government will do to protect our gambling addicts from excessive spending via their credit cards on online lotteries and keno products.</span>

I acknowledge the member for her ongoing engagement on matters relating to harm minimisation. The member approaches this issue with the best intentions. The government will not, however, be supporting the amendments in their current form. The 2021 Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services inquiry recommended banning online gambling operators from accepting credit card payments, excluding lotteries. Lotteries, including those offered by charitable organisations, are excluded from the ban, as they present a lower risk of gambling harm. In its report handed down last month the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee acknowledged concerns by stakeholders about lotteries, specifically around keno-type lotteries, and recommended:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments I'm moving today have six objectives, but the overarching purpose is to draw attention to the fact that the bill has real room for improvement. It could do so much more to address the concerns of the community. I do not object to the changes being made by the bill and will happily support it, because we need to stop credit cards being used for gambling, but the bill could have and should have gone much further and delivered more of the changes the community wants to see from this government on gambling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My amendments will deliver some of those changes. The first is a comprehensive ban on advertising by online gambling businesses. In our daily lives we are inundated with gambling advertising, from branding on sports jerseys and signage across stadiums to constant reminders about odds during sports and news broadcasts. It's absolutely everywhere.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A comprehensive ban was one of most important recommendations of the recent House inquiry into online gambling and one that I personally believe we need to see swiftly implemented. The government and opposition have both said the status quo needs to change, but we have yet to see real action on legislative reform. There is no time to waste when real lives are being impacted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first step should be a total ban on online gambling and then a move to prohibiting inducements, preventing odds being reported during sports broadcasts and phasing out team sponsorships by gambling companies. Secondly, we must ban political donations by online gambling businesses. In an ideal world, businesses that engage in harmful practices would not be able to exert influence over our political process through donations or favours. We are a long way off this world, but we can take a step in that direction by prohibiting donations from gambling businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third step is to have Treasury look at how GST distribution is affected by state gambling policies and, at the very least, ensure states are not penalised for stricter gambling regulation. It is an incredibly narrow, technical issue which nonetheless shapes the incentives of state and territory governments when it comes to gambling regulation. Those governments are more reluctant to take action if the loss of gambling tax revenue is compounded by the loss of GST revenue as well. We should reform current distribution arrangements so that it's no longer a problem, and we should consider providing incentives for those governments to take sensible steps to limit harm and problem gambling within their jurisdictions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fourth step is to establish a federal gambling regulator. As a House inquiry has shown, online gambling is regulated at the state and territory level, but, as the activity is online, the businesses can be based wherever they please. This creates a regulatory race to the bottom, where states can offer weaker regulatory frameworks and lower tax rates to attract businesses and gambling tax revenue to their jurisdictions. We should establish a national regulator to: ensure that all businesses are subject to a robust regulatory framework that emphasises the importance of consumer protection; support those at risk of problem gambling; impose minimum standards across all operators; and ensure that gambling businesses pay an appropriate amount of tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fifth step is to require the government to make a formal response to the House inquiry into online gambling. This inquiry was a substantial piece of work. It received 160 submissions from across the community, held 13 public hearings and made 31 recommendations. The final report was tabled back in June, but we are yet to receive a formal response from the minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last of my amendments would prohibit gambling businesses from employing politicians or senior public servants after they leave office. There is a huge potential conflict of interest for anyone who is responsible for overseeing and regulating these businesses. These decisions can have a massive influence on the profitability of gambling businesses, and those decisions could be influenced by the prospect of a high-paying appointment. We should act today to introduce rules that prevent this behaviour and protect the integrity of our political and regulatory frameworks. My amendment would prohibit any parliamentarian or senior public servant from taking up employment with a gambling business for two years after they leave office or five years if they have had direct responsibility for gambling policy or regulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are six things the government could do that would go a long way towards improving integrity and delivering on community expectations about how gambling activity should be regulated and controlled. I strongly encourage the government not to underrate the depth of feeling in the community about these matters. A huge number of people genuinely feel that the prevalence of gambling promotion is ruining their enjoyment of sport and is ruining people's lives. This is felt particularly strongly by parents, who want to watch football or cricket with their kids without the constant references to gambling odds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I suspect the government will not be supporting these amendments, so I invite the minister to address each of these issues I have raised. I would particularly encourage her to commit to responding to the online gambling inquiry before parliament rises for the summer.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:44</span>):  I rise in support of these amendments. As I said during the last parliamentary sitting, the Interactive Gambling Amendment (Credit and Other Measures) Bill 2023 in its unamended form is a small but significant step towards addressing the harms of gambling in Australia. Prohibiting the acceptance of credit cards, credit related products and digital currency as means of payment for online gambling services is necessary but not sufficient.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments proposed now by the member for Wentworth go further towards addressing the reforms needed. We've been waiting six months for the government to respond to the strong recommendations in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Y</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ou win some</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> you lose more</span> report from the Social Policy and Legal Affairs Committee, of which I'm a member. We need to see a consistent regulatory framework across the country. We need measures to address the pervasive advertising associated with online gambling, a coordinated public education campaign, a mechanism to monitor and develop consumer protection for interactive gambling and simulated gambling, and the banning of all political donations from gambling companies. If the government won't draft its own legislation to address these matters, then it can start by accepting these amendments.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In mid-2022, a survey showed 71 per cent of Australians supported a ban on gambling ads. All of the research is telling us that the immersive technology platforms not only mean people can gamble whenever they want 24/7 but that these interactive platforms are becoming more and more sophisticated with their targeted, invasive advertising strategies on social media and direct messaging. This is why the amendment to ban advertising by interactive gambling businesses is necessary and urgent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments also prohibit providers from making political donations. We read in the <span style="font-style:italic;">AFR</span> today that the communications minister, who regulates gambling, was taken out to lunch for her birthday by the gambling lobbyists, after a long history of receiving hospitality and donations from gambling companies and gambling lobbyists: tickets to the races, shows at Crown casino and hosted fundraising dinners. None of these things are against the currently overly lax rules, but they're just wrong. I can't imagine that many Australians would be happy about this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My restoring trust bill, introduced into this House in August, includes a proposed reform banning donations from any company inflicting social harm. The very broad consensus, supported by alarming data, is that gambling does a great deal of harm, not just significant financial harm but psychological and social harms as well. In 2022, gambling and alcohol companies contributed $2 million to major parties. Sportsbet donated $278,000, including a donation of $19,000 to the communications minister in the week of the election. We clearly need to remove the influence and perception of influence of gambling companies from the political arena.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments would also prevent online gambling providers from employing senior government advisers. This is important. A revolving door between government and gambling companies will not fill us with confidence that the government is making decisions in the best interests of the community. It gives gambling companies inside information and increases their influence. The many people across Australia experiencing gambling harm just do not have this type of influence. Government should be looking out for them, not for the companies that inflict the harm and may employ them one day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another proposed amendment goes beyond the interactive gambling inquiry and requires Treasury to fix the GST problem when it comes to gambling. WA has banned pokies. We're very proud of it. This has had bipartisan support for a long time in WA. As a result, the WA government earns no revenue from pokies, and we wouldn't want to change that. We look at the other states, and we see how hard it is to get rid of pokies when you're already getting a cut of the profits. This is yet another example of how money influences decisions in this gambling space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need governments to be making decisions in the interests of communities, not gambling companies. I support these amendments wholeheartedly. If the government is not willing to accept them—communities across Australia will be watching very carefully, expecting to see these types of changes announced. Next week marks six months since the committee report came out. This is the period during which government is expected to respond. Time is up. We must clean up online gambling in Australia.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Greenway</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Communications</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:49</span>):  I thank the member for Wentworth for bringing these amendments to the parliament. I don't doubt the member's good intentions. The fact is that this is a broad-ranging set of proposals which deal with everything from taxation to issues that fall within the ambit of the Special Minister of State and, perhaps, even beyond the Commonwealth to state rules and regulations. Whilst I do appreciate and acknowledge her right to bring this forward, I note that this is the first time that the government is seeing this and that we will not be able to support this amendment at this time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the member for Curtin for her contribution. This is a government that will be judged on its delivery when it comes to harm minimisation, and I invite the honourable member to identify which incoming government has done more in the space of harm minimisation in 18 months than the Albanese government? We have before us an important bill, to ban the use of credit cards for online gambling, to bring this in line with land based gambling. The harm of this has been known for nearly three years. It is time that this legislation was passed. It is time that we moved forward with a ban so that people cannot bet with money they do not have in the online environment. It is time to get this done. This government has picked up a report that lay dormant under the previous government and is taking it forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also invite honourable members to consider the fact that it's under this government that we have implemented the final stages of the National Consumer Protection Framework for Online Wagering in Australia and, most importantly, in relation to implementing the National Self-Exclusion Register. As I said, this is a government that will be judged on its delivery, and it is my signature, as minister, that is on the proclamation commencing BetStop. Let's look at what BetStop stop has done in the relatively short time since August 2023. Over 10,000 Australians have voluntarily registered themselves with BetStop. More than 80 per cent of those registered are under 40 years of age. And, so far, a third of people have registered for lifetime exclusion. The actions of this government are changing lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a multifaceted problem which had been left dormant for some 10 years under the previous government. The last time they tinkered with the advertising rules, it actually resulted in an increase in advertising in some aspects of broadcasting. We are going to get this right. We know the time and care that have been put into this report by the House of Representatives. It has 31 recommendations, which we welcome and which we're considering holistically. We're also assessing them to ensure that we get this done and that we get it done and implemented effectively.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note that, as a government, we have implemented the final phase of the national consumer protection framework when it comes to updating taglines. The outdated 'gamble responsibly' taglines are being replaced. We've also had, under myself as minister, changes to the classification rules. In some aspects those have, again, been left dormant for some 25 years. This will enable and update the framework to ensure that we have proper classifications for computer games or online games that contain simulated gambling or loot boxes. We know from our engagement with harm-minimisation experts, advocates and clinicians that this is a critical aspect of harm minimisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government, and myself as minister, will be judged on our delivery. We understand the importance of this to the Australian people, but, most importantly, we understand that it is multifaceted—that it needs to be done carefully and implemented properly to get it right and to get results.</span>

I acknowledge the work that the minister has done and the government has done, but, frankly, as a crossbencher, it's not my problem or the issue of the crossbench that the previous government didn't take enough action. We have been in this parliament for 18 months, and it's only up to a three-year term. It's quite a narrow term, so it is important to understand what the minister's plans are to address some of these issues and which of those issues are going to be covered in those reviews that you will be taking forward.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:57</span>):  I will speak this afternoon in continuation after the last sitting. Additionally, procurement under the FFSP Regulations means that many programs are not subject to effective regulatory oversight arrangements. This legislation will change that. It will allow for a clear framework under the act to fund disability services outside of the NDIS and ensure that funding is subject to proper oversight. A mandatory code of conduct for all providers will be embedded into the legislation, similar to that of the NDIS code of conduct, ensuring that there is consistency in the quality of disability services. The code of conduct will set standards and obligations that service providers and their staff must adhere to. Those in breach of the code may have their funding arrangements revoked or altered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills also establish the framework for consistent complaints-management requirements for providers, ensuring that Australians can make complaints regarding services and the department can act effectively, a crucial step in creating greater accountability and better safeguards for Australians with disabilities who receive support outside the NDIS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation will introduce an instrument that will allow the regulation of eligible activities, meaning providers in emerging, unregulated activities that are to be now regulated would require a certificate of compliance. This instrument is similar to that prescribed by the National Disability Insurance Scheme (Provider Registration and Practice Standards) Rules 2018. We know that many providers work all across the centre, interacting with state and federal government bodies and complying with various requirements. Where appropriate, alternative quality standards may be recognised to reduce duplication and regulatory burden for providers, ensuring they are both adequately certified and can effectively provide services to all that need them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, this legislation does not define disability, which is in line with the majority of the feedback during the consultation. We know that disability can be complex, and to define it could potentially and unnecessarily restrict a person with disability from accessing vital services. The legislation recognises that, and specific programs continue to define target groups that require specific services and support. There are over 4.4 million Australians with a disability, and the government must be there to ensure that they can fully participate in the community. That is the foundational purpose of government agencies such as the NDIS. But we know that the vast majority of those with a disability, roughly four million Australians, are not supported through the NDIS, and they receive services from a number of programs that operate outside it—programs that receive funding under the current framework, which this legislation will modernise and improve. It will ensure that these programs can effectively support Australians with a disability alongside or to complement the support provided by the NDIS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills are another step in our government's commitment to support those Australians who rely on services. We are under no illusion that this will be the last step. Whether it be continued support and the strengthening of the NDIS or the recent establishment of the task force to respond to the royal commission's recommendations, the Albanese Labor government will continue supporting all Australians living with a disability, because they fundamentally deserve to live with dignity and respect. I am proud to commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="297660" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr RYAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:01</span>):  The Disability Services and Inclusion Bill 2023 will establish a new legislative framework for the funding and regulation of those new and existing disability related programs which operate outside the National Disability Insurance Scheme, the NDIS. The bill builds upon the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 and Australia's Disability Strategy 2021-2031. It prescribes statutory funding conditions aimed at ensuring good quality, safe supports and services for people with disabilities, their families and their carers. Its broad eligibility criteria will allow a range of services to be provided to those requiring disability services outside the NDIS. For example, people who have temporary disabilities or those who are living in Australia on a time limited visa will potentially be eligible for support under the DSIA, as may individuals aged more than 65 who are currently ineligible for NDIS services but hope that that situation may change in future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill does not, but I feel it should, specifically address the provision of disability support services in circumstances where people are deprived of their liberty. This is especially important, given the significant representation of people with a disability in all types of places of detention in this country. The bill, in my opinion, should stipulate that eligible activities can include supports or services provided to people in immigration detention facilities—who, let's remember, spend an average of 711 days in detention in this country. This would be consistent with key recommendations of the Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability's final report in relation to Australia's commitment to the implementation of the optional protocol to the convention against torture. I've sought assurance from the minister that the explanatory memorandum of this bill will be amended to include that stipulation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More than one in six Australians have a disability. The NDIS currently supports more than 600,000 people. The 3.8 million individuals with physical and mental disabilities who do not qualify for the NDIS have at times felt left out in the cold. We have to establish systems which enable supports and services which will benefit all people with disabilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS has moved many government supports from sole direct service provision to include person centred market models of service delivery and support. Almost from inception it has become a backup default service for most children and adults with developmental disorders, delays and disabilities as other disability supports and programs, particularly those funded by state and territory governments, have been defunded or become defunct.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Vacation of the space previously filled by community-based block-funded services has left a void for those people who have multidevelopmental delay or physical disabilities. This has resulted in development of massive inequities. Those on the scheme, the NDIS, receive much more support than nonparticipants. Melbourne Disability Services reports that 90 per cent of people without NDIS funding are unable to access the supports they need. This renders current clients desperate to retain their NDIS funding and others fighting to become eligible. When all you have is a hammer, everything starts looking a lot like a nail. This has led to the situation where 11 per cent of Australian boys aged five to seven years, and five per cent of five- to seven-year-old girls are NDIS participants. That's unsustainable and it demands change. It is my sincere hope that this bill will facilitate that change, in concert with the systemwide changes which I hope will be recommended by the forthcoming Independent Review of the NDIS Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS was established as a classic market based system, but the reality is that there are still shortages of many allied health disciplines and other disability sector providers. This thin and complex market means that appropriately skilled providers often can't be found or accessed. Establishment of a private marketplace of services funded by government has meant that there's little incentive for clients to cease their publicly funded support. The market model for providers incentivises repeat customers, not the provision of the high-quality outcomes-driven services that would lead to system exits. So we've seen numbers of participants on the NDIS increase because those participants are failing to leave the scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The disability market fails where participants need more specialised supports and in areas where there are poor economics of scale. Because of the shortages of providers, those in the market have been able to raise their prices to the maximum permitted by the NDIS scheme, to levels above those supported by other services—the TAC, Veterans' Affairs and aged care—so that individuals in those other schemes are failing to compete. The siloing of funding in different schemes and the variability of funding that is provided have set up what is effectively a 'hunger games' for disabled individuals who are seeking care and support. We all know that the disability dollar is not unlimited. The NDIS is expected to cost $50 billion annually by 2024-2025, more than the annual budget for Medicare or even defence—nuclear submarines notwithstanding. And let's not forget that the NDIS serves only 600,000 of the 4.4 million Australians living with a disability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This sort of legislation really matters. It's a shame that it has received such scant attention from the opposition, who failed to improve disability services for many years, who had not managed the market of service providers and who had not put into place adequate quality or standards monitoring for many of the services provided under the auspices of the NDIS. When done well, disability care generates both revenue and productivity by facilitating employment and facilitating engagement of people with disabilities, and by freeing their carers to return to the workforce. The multiplier effect of disability care is significant. In the NDIS, every dollar spent generates an economic contribution of $2.25. This is a service; it's not an expense. As a member of parliament and as a member of the parliament's Joint Standing Committee on the NDIS, I hear often from individuals with disabilities, their carers and their relatives about their frustration and anger with many aspects of our disability care. I hear from patients and families unable to find affordable and accessible psychologists, psychiatrists, dietitians, physiotherapists, speech pathologists or occupational therapists. I hear from older individuals who have acquired disability after age 65 and who have therefore been shut out of the NDIS. I've heard how we have forced disabled Australians and their partners, parents and carers to battle a system in which transparency and generosity have been sacrificed to red tape and mean-spirited bureaucracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given those issues, I remain concerned that this legislation does not appear to make sufficient provision for robust and independent oversight of the quality and safeguards in disability services provided outside the NDIS. It's intended that details of how systems will be overseen and the consequences for breaches will be set out in individual funding agreements or delegated legislation. But this approach increases the risk of inconsistent and nontransparent oversight mechanisms. I note the Commonwealth Ombudsman's call for prescription of requirements for complaints and incident management by service providers and of consequences for breaches. This would deliver a more consistent approach to complaints handling across the programs funded by the network. Importantly, it would also be consistent with the key recommendations of the Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Only this morning, the government proposed an amendment which will embed within this primary legislation a measure to ensure existing service providers are held to the same code of conduct as new entrants under the new act. This will mean that, once the legislative instruments are in place, all organisations that are currently receiving funding and whose legislative authority would fall under the new Disability Services and Inclusion Act 2023 for future funding arrangements will also have that code of conduct applied. This is a positive step, but you have to ask why it was made only today and why we can't have the details of oversight mechanisms and enforcement provisions in the body of this legislation rather than buried in the delegated legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The question remains: how do we best support those needing help within and without the NDIS? We can, we should and we must do better with disability supports in this country. We have to increase access to, and provision of, community based programs for infants and young children with developmental delay, children with mild autism and neurodivergence, and adults with mild deficits. For those individuals, not only will group therapy result in better use of resources; it might also promote inclusion. We have to increase the range of community and mainstream supports for people without severe disability. We need to provide group therapy and services for all who are able to benefit from them. This model would need us to resile from our current premise that all disabled people must self-manage their care and should receive support individually. The model would also mean that, as a society, we accept our responsibility to include and support all individuals and their variations and imperfections, and to create a context accepting of their varying capacities and needs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend this bill to the House, and I hope it will be effective in improving outcomes for all Australians with mental and physical disability.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:12</span>):  I am very pleased to be speaking on the Disability Services and Inclusion Bill 2023. Over 4.4 million people in Australia live with some form of disability—that's approximately 20 per cent of all Australians—and this proportion increases as we age. For Australians over 65 it's about 40 per cent, reflecting the likelihood of disability increases with age. There are 2.1 million Australians of working age with disability, and 35.9 per cent of Australian households include a person with disability—and mine is one of those households. Disability is not an unusual experience in our country but people with disability are a group that often don't experience the same human rights as other Australians, and that's not good enough.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also explicitly reflects Australia's commitment to supporting people with disability in line with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Disability Services and Inclusion (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2023 will replace the Disability Services Act 1986 with a modern legislative framework for the funding and regulation of programs targeted for the benefit of people with disability, their families and carers. The Disability Services and Inclusion (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2023 will make consequential amendments to legislation that reference the Disability Services Act to assure no adverse impact and assure continuity of services and arrangements. And I'll be referring to them collectively as the DSI bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to expanding the population that can benefit from funding authorised by this bill, it also broadens funding options so that governments can respond to emerging needs and changing circumstances both now and into the future. The DSI bill contributes to improving and aligning quality and safeguarding arrangements for disability services by introducing a code of conduct and including the power to recognise other standards. To support an inclusive process, the bill uses modern language to establish a contemporary framework for disability supports and services that comply with the human rights approach.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been significant changes to the disability policy landscape since the Disability Services Act was introduced, which predates the internet, and this includes Australia's adoption of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2008; the introduction of the National Disability Strategy 2010-2020, which was followed by the development and implementation of Australia's Disability Strategy 2021-2031; and, of course, the establishment of the NDIS, which has been a game changer.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The disability sector has called for changes to disability services legislation so that it's more aligned with this transformed service delivery landscape and affirms the rights of people with disability to full inclusion in Australian society. The DSI bill is designed to help deliver the government's commitment to enable people with disability to participate fully in society, to exercise choice and control over their lives and to improve job opportunities, job readiness and support in employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Contemporary disability programs employ a range of service delivery models that were not envisaged when the current act was established, and their funding must currently be under the Financial Framework (Supplementary Powers) Regulation 1997. A single unified piece of enabling legislation authorising funding for disability services and supports will avoid the significant administrative delays and lack of effective regulatory oversight of the current system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Providing a public code of conduct will ensure consistency in the quality of disability supports and services, helping to keep people with disabilities safe. Repealing the current act and replacing it with a modern and more broadly based framework offers the most effective means to create a fit-for-purpose legislative basis for disability programs. The new bill will allow for greater flexibility to respond to emerging needs and changing circumstances now and into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is needed. Repealing the current act, replacing it with contemporary, modern and streamlined legislation is the most effective way to ensure that the government is able to support all people with disability and complement the supports provided to people with disability who are eligible for the NDIS. This new act will help deliver on the government's commitment to enable people with disability to participate fully in society and exercise full choice and control over their lives. This legislation will strengthen the provision of consistent, high-quality supports and services and ensure people with disability are safe when accessing them through introducing a code of conduct, compliance requirements for eligible activities and consistent and mandatory complaints management processes. Supports and services will continue to be subject to quality and safeguard checks to make sure they are appropriately delivered and that they are person-centred. Consistent national standards will ensure the rights and safety of people with disability in accessing support and services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill embeds its objects and guiding principles in primary legislation, whereas under the Disability Services Act, the objects and guiding principles are prescribed via legislative instrument. This change fosters greater transparency, more certainty and clear articulation of aims and objectives, and provides clearer guidance for actions taken under the legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also supports the realisation of the CRPD by focusing on capacity, experience, empowerment, potential and goals for people with disability. It will also strengthen safeguards and support timely responses to the Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability and non-NDIS initiatives arising from the NDIS review. The amendments will support the government's commitment to principles relating to the rights and opportunities for all people with disability, and will enable people with disability to participate fully in society and exercise full choice and control over their lives to improve their job opportunities, job readiness and support in employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill does not define disability. This ensures that the provisions in the bill are interpreted broadly and allows the bill to avoid unnecessarily restricting or excluding any person with disability from accessing the services and supports they need. The decision to forego a definition was made based on careful consideration of feedback from the first round of consultation and was tested through a second consultation, with the majority of feedback indicating support for the broad approach taken by the bill. The decision was also supported by a majority of witnesses who gave evidence to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, Legislation Committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The UN CRDP wording on disability is frequently raised as a potential definition. However, it does not define disability in article 2 - Definitions. The commonly referenced wording comes from article 1, which is about purpose:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Persons with disabilities include those who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The use of 'include' and the open-ended nature of various barriers in this clause would not be suitable for a legislated definition of disability and excluding these terms would narrow the definition, contrary to the intent of the bill. The lack of a definition does not create issues in targeting supports and services funded under the bill. Individual programs and measures funded under the bill can define appropriate target groups for their services, depending on the nature of the program, service or support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of this bill is to enable funding for disability services and supports outside of the NDIS that are not covered by state, territory or local government obligations under Australia's disability strategy. It does not sit in isolation or give effect to international obligations or other legislation on its own. The bill is part of a broader suite of Commonwealth legislation, such as the NDIS Act, the Disability Discrimination Act and the Social Security Act, which all contribute to upholding and promoting the rights of people with disabilities. It complements other Commonwealth legislation, but does so within the scope and objects of the bill. The bill is an enabling legislative framework, offering flexibility and clear authority to fund future supports and services to respond to needs and changing circumstances. The design of new supports and services in the future will be determined by the government of the day, based on these needs and circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013, the bill is not demand driven and does not create any obligation for the Commonwealth to fund services. This means that the types of services and supports which are funded and the level of funding allocated will remain a decision of the government of the day. Currently, the government can fund services for people with disability outside the current act. However, the new act provides for an improved and more systematic approach to quality and safeguarding arrangements for those services, as all relevant services will now be subject to those arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been extensive public consultation on the bill. The department of social security held public consultations between November 2022 and February 2023. This was to explain the intention to repeal and replace the current act and to give people a chance to provide feedback on what the new act should look like and achieve. The feedback received in the first consultation, including from people with disability, was used to draft the bill. The department then conducted a second consultation, from July 2023 to August 2023, to explain the exposure draft of the bill and invite feedback. This consultation included a number of public information seminars to explain the bill and answer any questions raised. People were invited to complete an online survey, upload a submission or both. Feedback received through both consultations has informed the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill establishes a contemporary inclusive framework to fund Commonwealth programs targeted for the benefit of people with disability, their families and their carers. The impact of the bill will be felt across the disability services and support landscape and across the disability community through the government recognising their right to safe and inclusive services that protect their rights and across all of Australia by contributing to creating an inclusive society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill promotes consistency, coordination and accessibility of support services for people with disability and provides a clear basis for the Commonwealth to continue funding disability services and supports alongside the NDIS and alongside state and territory services. Providers will also be subject to stronger and more consistent regulatory requirements to protect the safety and rights of people with disability. This will take into account the nature of the services they provide.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill represents significant legislative reform and demonstrates this government's continued commitment to breaking down barriers for people with disability and enabling participation. This bill will benefit all 4.4 million Australians with disability, their families, their carers, their friends and their loved ones by enabling inclusive, accessible and safe supports and services and, importantly, it will contribute to creating a more inclusive society.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:27</span>):  In the short time that I have tonight, I want to touch on a few things in relation to the Disability Services and Inclusion Bill 2023. I will probably come back and finish my speech tomorrow. I've been here for seven years now and, in this place, we have an opportunity to change people's lives for the better and, if we get it wrong, we change their lives for the worse. I am a dad of a daughter who lives with disabilities, Sarah. I'm very proud of my youngest daughter, Sarah. I know that tonight actually she is speaking at the Rotary Club of Mooloolaba about disabilities. I am really proud of her for reaching out into our community and talking about living with disability as a young person. She is a real inspiration and it is my privilege to be her dad. It's my privilege to try in some small way assist people with disabilities. Sarah has certainly taught me a hell of a lot about that. I'm very proud of you, Sarah.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are 4.4 million Australians who live with disabilities. Those disabilities vary broadly and very widely as to whether they are physical or intellectual, and the scope of those disabilities vary. But one thing remains common amongst all people who live with disabilities, and that is that they want every opportunity to be able to enjoy the same quality of life and the same standard of living as people who live without disabilities—people like me, for example. Sarah tells me, 'Dad, all I want is to be able to live a good and meaningful life and have the same opportunities as everybody else.' When I travel with Sarah—even when we go to the supermarket—we get looks from people when they see Sarah. We get the look that makes me feel uncomfortable, and I know it makes my daughter feel uncomfortable as well.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WALLACE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  I'm changing tone. I'm here tonight to speak about the lack of infrastructure on the Sunshine Coast and more broadly throughout Australia. This government, through its infrastructure minister, announced a 90-day review of every Commonwealth government infrastructure project. That 90-day review has now blown out to almost 200 days. People on the Sunshine Coast are absolutely sick and tired—they are absolutely sick to death—of the state Labor government and now the federal Labor government withholding critical infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we were in government, the former coalition government allocated $1.6 billion to bring passenger rail from Beerwah to Caloundra, Kawana and Maroochydore. I was really pleased when the current infrastructure minister said that they were going to keep that $1.6 billion in the budget. They kept it in their mini budget in October 2022 and they even kept it in their May budget of 2023, but very shortly after that they announced this 90-day review, so yet again the people of the Sunshine Coast are left wondering whether they are ever going to get passenger rail along the coastal strip.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have less than nine years until the Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games start in 2032. How does the federal or state Labor governments expect to be able to get people from point A to point B, from Brisbane to the Sunshine Coast, for those games? How? Are they going to use the Bruce Highway? The Bruce Highway is logjammed now. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need critical infrastructure. It's not just in relation to the Olympic Games or the Paralympic Games. The Sunshine Coast is expecting to have a population of 500,000 people by 2040. That's another 170,000 people on top of what we have now. Already our roads are bursting at the seams with traffic. We're one of the most popular destinations in the country, and fair enough. It's a beautiful place to live. Everybody is moving there, particularly from down south. It's not hard to believe or imagine why. We are bursting at the seams. We have a critical need for public transport infrastructure, and this government has put everything on hold. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just about heavy rail and passenger rail. This government is also putting at risk a $160 million commitment for the construction of the Mooloolah River Interchange, one of the most dangerous intersections in Queensland, if not the country. The $160 million that Ted O'Brien, the member for Fairfax, and I were able to secure to pay for half the cost of stage 1 also now has a great axe swinging over it. What really gets me is that this government talks about housing and claims to be the government of housing.</span>

                  </a>  I can hear my friend the member for Deakin laughing. Would you believe, Member for Deakin, that they have actually demolished the homes of more than 300 Sunshine Coast locals and turfed them out of their home to build this interchange, which now may not even happen at all? We're finding a situation where more than 300 Sunshine Coast locals have been dislocated in the worst housing crisis this country has ever seen and now, because of this infrastructure minister's delays and dithering, that project may not even happen. If this government is serious about housing, and if it's serious about infrastructure, it'll commit to those projects on the Sunshine Coast.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="278522" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  I rise to speak about the distressing and dangerous events that occurred in my electorate and my community over the weekend. I know that tensions are high right now. I know that people are devastated by watching what is happening across the world. I know that my community is feeling it, and I know that they're not the only ones. I know that there are other people and other Australians who are shattered by what they're seeing on their TV screens. But we need to remember that we are here in Australia and that we share a common purpose and a common bond, that, as Australians, we respect each other and we respect each other's right to exist freely and safely in our own communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In what seemed like an overwhelming day, we woke up in my electorate to news of a burger chain having been set alight. Let me take this opportunity to extend my best wishes to the owner at what must be an extremely distressing time right now. That's an awful thing to happen to a business. I say this with clarity: what happened there needs to be uncovered by the police and needs to be investigated by the police. I can also tell you that there were Jewish community leaders that, if there was an inkling that this was in any way, shape or form a crime motivated by hate, were ready, with me, to condemn that act, as appropriate, because we can never, ever have violence motivated by race or religion in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the police have come out and said that they do not believe that this was racially motivated. If we are making our own judgements and casting our own aspersions, then this is a dangerous and slippery slope. What followed after the accusation that this was somehow motivated by hate was that there was a call for a protest to come to Caulfield to stand in solidarity with this burger chain. That is a dangerous call to action. It is akin to calling a whole range of Jewish or Israeli expats to go into the heart of an Islamic community, when tensions are so high right now. I would never make that call. I think that it's incumbent on all of us to be responsible as leaders in our community, to think about our actions and to think about what the consequences could be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want Australians who are going to the mosques to go safely with their community and to be with one another right now. Of course they should have that. I also want people in my electorate to know that they can go to synagogue and be safe and to be with one another right now, because they deserve that too. On Friday night, they weren't afforded that. Synagogue was cancelled, and people in my own community were terrified of the scenes and the videos that were being sent around in our WhatsApp groups.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to this House that these tensions that are going on right now are going to go on for a little while longer, and I want them to stop right now. Of course I do. I think every member of this House wants them to stop and never wanted them to start in the first place. But we all bear responsibility for what happens in Australia right now. We bear responsibility to be deliverers of truth and to make sure that the information that we're passing on does not inflame tensions but rather reflects the responsible actions of leaders in difficult times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also our responsibility to ensure that we are absolutely supporting people's right to protest. I am a proud Labor member, and I'm proudly supporting people's right to protest in this country. I will always defend that, but it is an incitement to come to the heart of Jewish communities and bring a political message in this time. That is not protesting, that is incitement. I say this with clarity and with a deep sense of devastation, that I want this all to be over and that I want us to go back to the peace-loving country that we are. But we need to get through the next few months together. We cannot have a situation where communities are put at risk; we cannot have a situation where people in this place, and other leaders, are inflaming tensions. It is our duty to bring calm and to bring leadership to this moment, and I hope that every member of this place, and all Australians, get through this together.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="242515" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SUKKAR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  It is clear that after 18 months of this Labor government, Australians are worse off. Australians are worse off in a number of ways, because this is a government and a Prime Minister who is distracted, a Prime Minister whose priorities are completely wrong and a Prime Minister who, in question time each and every day, thinks that things have never been better for the Australian people and that they should be very grateful for what he has delivered them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What has this government delivered in 18 months? What we've seen in the last 18 months is the cost-of-living crisis get worse and worse by the day. This was the Prime Minister who said before the election that he was going to reduce energy prices by $275 a year. He said that 97 times before the election and yet has not chosen to make that promise—to repeat that promise or repeat that statement—even once since the election. Why? Because we've seen electricity costs increase by 18 per cent. We've seen gas prices increase by 28 per cent. Every single Australian who goes to the supermarket or fills up at the bowser is seeing prices growing exponentially. Even before the election, the Prime Minister made a solemn commitment to Australians that life would be better under him. Indeed, he made the ill-fated promise of delivering cheaper mortgages. He even said to the Australian people before the election that he would deliver cheaper mortgages! What have we seen since then? We've seen 12 rate rises on his watch. We've seen the average Australian now paying $24,000 more per year in mortgage repayments than when this Prime Minister was elected. Indeed, we see data out of the OECD that shows disposable income for Australian families has dropped by 5.1 per cent, which is the highest drop of any developed nation in the world. So we're leading the leaderboard of a reduction in disposable income, a leaderboard that Australians do not want to lead but are leading under this Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And what has he been doing for the last 18 months? He has been wandering around the world and the Prime Minister has been spending huge amounts of time and energy on his Voice referendum proposal. We can all think back to those optimistic days of the Prime Minister holding a press conference with Shaquille O'Neal. Shaquille O'Neal was going to be the man who was going to be his secret weapon. Perhaps the Prime Minister can go and get some advice from Shaquille O'Neal on how on earth he delivers his promises to reduce power prices, to deliver cheaper mortgages and to make life easier for Australians. This Prime Minister has utterly failed on every single measure, and after 18 months Australians, quite frankly, realise they cannot afford a Labor government. I think that Australians have had doubts for a long time. Can we afford Labor governments?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They've seen quite directly that not only is their disposable income down but that in a material sense they're poorer now than they were 18 months ago, and that things are likely to get worse. Why? Because the Labor Party don't know how to manage an economy. The Labor Party are a party of vested interests. They basically work through the list of requests from their union paymasters, who handpick them and who put them into parliament, and then give them the list that they need to work through after the election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They are completely out of touch with ordinary, everyday Australians. We see on a daily basis that the senior leadership of the Labor Party are very comfortable at dinner parties and very comfortable strutting red carpets—very comfortable in those forums—but not when it comes to understanding the pressures on the Australian people. Nothing is more galling than when the Prime Minister is asked questions about these things—when he is invited to repeat his promise of delivering a $275 energy reduction, or to repeat his promise that he was going to deliver cheaper mortgages—and he sits there at the dispatch box with a supercilious smile, as if Australians have never had it better. Well, Prime Minister, Australians are suffering. Start focusing on the things that matter to everyday Australians. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  I rise tonight to honour the lives of two beloved Cunningham branch members of the mighty Australian Labor Party: Stella Chapman and Ron Pretty. I'm honoured to be joined tonight by both families up in the gallery. It's been an absolute pleasure hosting you here today. I want to thank you all for making the journey from Sydney and the South Coast to remember Stella and Ron.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 30 June 2023, we sadly lost Ronald Keith Pretty, AM. Ron passed away peacefully at home, just as he wished, after a long but courageous cancer journey. Ron is survived by his dearly beloved wife Jane; his daughters Alana and Saroja; their partners, Jakub and Luke; and his deeply adored grandchildren, Alexander, Olivia, Nathaniel, Lachlan, Eliza and Oliver, most of whom are here tonight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as a loving father, husband and grandparent, Ron was a widely respected poet, a devoted teacher, publisher and mentor for Australian poets. I know Saroja and Alana, as well as all of Ron's grandchildren, will cherish his poetry for years to come, and I'm sure <span style="font-style:italic;">Eggshells</span> will become a family heirloom for generations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In recognition of his dedication, in 2001 Ron received a Premier's award for his lifetime service to literature, followed by becoming a Member of the Order of Australia shortly after, in 2002. In 2012, he was awarded a six-month residency at the Whiting studio in Rome, and, in 2015, Ron was granted a fellowship back home at the University of Wollongong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ron was a committed, active member of the Mount Kembla Unanderra branch, regularly contributing to policy discussions and providing ideas of how Labor could achieve our best ideals. Ron was a strong advocate for the most vulnerable, particularly the rights of asylum seekers. He regularly developed branch motions and actively contributed to discussions to ensure that the rights of asylum seekers were protected and understood by everyone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 5 October 2023, we also sadly lost the formidable Stella Chapman. Stella joined the party in 1976 and held numerous positions across many branches that she was a member of. Notably, she was the President of the South Coast SEC for a number of years and also helped to establish the bay and basin branch of the Australian Labor Party on the South Coast, which she was immensely proud of. In 2005, she was awarded the prestigious McKell Award for her years of service to the party, and in 2017 became a life member of the party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Stella is survived by her loving children and stepchildren, Michele, Ross, Gloria, Ian, Araya, Vanessa, Ged and Natalie; grandchildren Heath, Kareena, Ambre, Dean, Ben, Luke, Leon, Melinda, Emily and Romy; and 15 great-grandchildren, Ashaylen, Layla, Sharden, Zahir, Charlise, Sage, Evie, Kairo, Oscar, Connor, Kayden, Abe, Digby, Cody and baby Koa, who was born last week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know Stella was particularly proud of her granddaughter, and my friend, Kareena, when she began working in federal politics two years ago for Fiona Phillips and spent time here at Parliament House. One of my favourite recent memories was when Vanessa and her daughter Kareena kindly picked up Stella's best friend Annie Wilcox from the nursing home last year and brought Annie and Stella to Paul Scully's lunch with now Deputy Premier Prue Car. They jumped straight back into their usual routine, scrunching the raffle tickets and, of course, giving a running commentary: 'When is the food going to arrive?' and 'Was the fish a bit dry?' One of them wasn't sure about the calamari. They love to have a laugh. They love to have a whinge, and they were awesomely over-opinionated and outspoken. These were my favourite words from Stella: 'These lemon cakes just aren't lemony enough, and they aren't very sweet.' I understand she had the same experience with lemon chicken.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Stella has probably already joined a branch of the Labor Party up there in the sky. In fact she has probably already taken over the branch from Gough Whitlam and Bob Hawke and ensured that the lemon cakes are finally lemony enough—or at least she will have made her views about them clearly known. Both Stella and Ron loved their Labor Party, and we love them back. On behalf of Labor in Cunningham: We love you. We miss you. Rest in peace.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="231027" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TAYLOR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hume</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  As we get closer to the end of the year, many of us start thinking about the joy of Christmas and, of course, Christmas would never be complete without a tree. There's nothing that says Christmas is around the corner quite like seeing the tree go up at home. That is something I always cherished as a kid, and I'm sure many Australians feel the same way. There was a great routine about our tree each year. For us, it was cutting down a pine tree or cutting a branch off one of the pine trees around the house where I grew up, just as we do today. It's exactly the same thing. For every family, it's different, as they put up their tree and put up their decorations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I want to share with the House the story of a local family in my electorate who have been, literally, at the centre of so many Christmas celebrations over many, many years and over a large area. For 45 years, the Boag family from Wingello have been at the heart of growing and supplying Christmas trees to thousands of Australian families. No doubt Christmas can be a busy time for so many of us, but none more so than John and Louisa Boag of Wingello. They supply premium retail Christmas trees right across Australia. Their farming business, called the Christmas Tree Man, is set on a 1,200 acre farm at Paddy's River and was established by John's father, Robert, 45 years ago. John and Louisa have also raised their young children on their property.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Between October and December, the Boags hand-pick 18,000 trees which are then supplied to wholesale and retail markets. I know they have in recent years supplied trees to the Prime Minister of Australia, such is their quality. These amazing local trees end up in the homes of families all over Sydney and the Southern Highlands. This year the Christmas Tree Man will be supplying trees as far away as the Atherton Tablelands in Far North Queensland. These trees are in high demand, and one has even been on display here at Parliament House. It's farming businesses like these that are the absolute lifeblood of local communities like mine. They make a huge contribution to the local economy. The Boags themselves employ 12 to 15 employees each season, including a mix of backpackers, locals and permanent workers. Lots of hard work goes on behind the scenes to grow the perfect Christmas tree. Each year, 28,000 radiata pine seedlings need to be planted. They need to be pruned into shape twice yearly over a four- to five-year period. Then there is fertilisation and a very intensive harvest. Is it any wonder the Boags breathe a sigh of relief come January?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course farming doesn't come without its challenges, and there are many on this side of the House who have farmed for at least part of their careers and have seen those challenges. In the Boags case, there have been droughts of course, but in particular there with the devastating bushfires in the Shoalhaven River valley in January 2020. It formed the Morton fire, which ravaged Wingello. We saw a number of houses destroyed. We saw people lose their homes, and we saw impacts on many of the surrounding businesses and villages. It didn't end there. There were floods after that. Whilst radiata pines are a hardy crop, the trees struggle with saturation. There were many seedlings lost due to the heavy rains. Fortunately the drier conditions have now improved across the paddocks, and there is some balance in the seasons that they've seen since then.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John and Lou say the secret to growing a great Christmas tree is all in the pruning—promoting the right growth and maintaining that iconic Christmas tree shape. It requires dedication and persistence, and patience also helps. It's farmers around Australia like the Boags who work tirelessly behind the scenes to make sure that Australians can have a great Christmas. I know there are many farmers now working to make sure that they can provide pork, lamb or beef for people's Christmases. Those Australian farmers deserve our thanks for the incredible work they do every single year. I pay tribute to those wonderful farmers—not just the Boag family in Wingello but right across this great country of ours. As we lead up to Christmas, we should all keep the hard work they do in our thoughts.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="263547" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:55</span>):  During a telecommunications forum I held in my electorate of Corangamite in Victoria, one woman described a heartbreaking incident when her husband collapsed at home. She tried to call an ambulance, but there was no signal on her mobile phone. The woman then ran outside and finally got through. The ambos wanted her to monitor her husband, but she couldn't go back inside because there was no mobile coverage where her husband was lying on the ground. This incident serves as a stark reminder of how integral a mobile phone is and has become in our lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why, alongside my local community, I have advocated strongly for more mobile towers and better connectivity in my fast-growing region. It's why the Albanese government has committed $600,000 towards a new mobile station at St Leonards on the Bellarine. With Telstra now on board to build that station, we are one step closer towards bridging the mobile coverage gap in our region. Funded through the Improving Mobile Coverage Round of the Mobile Black Spot Program, this new tower for St Leonards is a crucial step towards ensuring our community has access to reliable and robust mobile connectivity. I acknowledge there's a lot of work to be done in securing a site for the new mobile tower, and Telstra will now need to go through various processes, including securing appropriate approvals and establishing an agreement with a local landholder. But, residents, please be assured: you will have a say in this process, as I know just how passionate you are about better connectivity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The tower in St Leonards builds on several new mobile towers in our region, including towers in Portarlington, Torquay, Ocean Grove, Barwon Heads, Armstrong Creek, Clifton Springs, Mount Duneed, Charlemont and Marcus Hill, to name a few. There's no doubt the reception has been very poor and sometimes non-existent in areas across my region. I have experienced this myself, travelling to and from townships across my electorate. But these new towers are improving connectivity and are a testament to the advocacy of local people. It means residents and visitors will be able to access more reliable phone coverage, helping them stay connected with family and friends and run successful businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Living on the Surf Coast, I know just how challenging the holiday period can be when it comes to mobile coverage. With the surge in holiday-makers, who come in their droves every summer, our existing telecommunications infrastructure comes under significant pressure. But, with the backing of our Albanese government, the telcos are now placing a renewed focus on our region. The CEO of Indara, Cameron Evans, recently told me: 'Access to fast and reliable mobile coverage isn't a nice-to-have; it's a must. That's why Indara is proud to be supporting improved mobile coverage and better connectivity in the communities of Corangamite—including Torquay, Armstrong Creek and across the Bellarine.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of this, our government has committed to strengthening the NBN because we know that good internet connectivity, like phone coverage, is so important to businesses, to schools, to families and to health services. To further expand the benefits of the NBN, our Albanese government has invested $2.4 billion to enable an additional 1.5 million premises to transition from fibre to the node to fibre to the premises by 2025.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I'd like to thank the St Leonards community, who have suffered from poor connectivity for a long time. Due to their passionate advocacy, we are now one step closer to better coverage for our region and for the St Leonards community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="300147" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VIOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  Businessman and philanthropist Marc Besen AC passed away last week in Melbourne. Mr Besen's story is one of great success and generosity. He's also a very special part of the Yarra Valley community through the establishment of the TarraWarra Museum of Art. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Born on 19 December 1923 in Romania, Marc and his family fled German occupation to Turkiye and then on to what is now Israel, where Marc lived with his family before heading to Australia. Marc started an import business and began supplying hosiery to a small business called Sussan's, run by Fay and Samuel Gandel, and in 1950 married their daughter Eva. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Eva, Marc found his touchstone, the heart of their close family and a partner in everything. Her loss in August 2021 was a devastating blow to Marc and the family. It was on their honeymoon in 1950 that Marc and Eva first developed their shared interest in art. As they drove through Europe, visiting art museums became a special joy for them. Neither had grown up with art around them, but together they discovered how much they loved it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1999, Eva and Marc began the process of creating a building to reflect their modernist taste and provide a regional venue in the Yarra Valley, where local, interstate and international visitors could experience changing exhibitions, public programs and a music festival. TarraWarra Museum of Art, Australia's first privately funded museum, was opened in 2003. Not only did Eva and Marc gift the building that houses the museum and four hectares of land; they also donated an extensive private collection to the museum. Since this time, TarraWarra has become one of the cultural treasures in the Yarra Valley, providing visitors with an experience comprising stunning architecture, a diverse program of exhibitions and events in beautiful surroundings. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was fortunate to have had the opportunity of meeting Marc almost a year ago at the exhibition opening for Peter Booth at TarraWarra. Even in his 90s, his strength of character and personality stood out. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Marc served as trustee for the National Gallery of Victoria, the Australian National Gallery and the National Museum of Australia. He was involved with the Victorian state opera and the Museum of Modern Art in New York, becoming the most effective ambassador for Australian art this country has ever produced. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Marc was one of a generation of Jewish migrants who made Australia undeniably better in so many ways. Blessed with a long life, Marc gave us the opportunity to observe a long life, well lived at each stage. On Australia Day in 2015 he was named a Companion of the Order of Australia. The citation reflected the breadth of Marc's contribution across social welfare, health, education and the arts. My deepest condolences to Naomi, Carol, Debbie, Daniel and their families. Rest in peace, Marc Besen. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:32</span>):  Yesterday I was in Kangaroo Ground, in the far north-eastern end of my electorate, for their remembrance service at the war memorial there. It was another example of the strong community spirit in Kangaroo Ground. I was pleased to recently drop into the Andrew Ross Museum, where Warwick and Carol Leeson take the lead in curating this local museum for our community to enjoy. I'm proud to have supported them with a volunteer grant of $3,000 to acquire some new IT equipment. Warwick and Carol tell me they can now start the process of digitising their records to allow them to share information with Public Record Office Victoria's collection. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kangaroo Ground Primary School is a small but vibrant school in our community, and it was great to catch up with the principal, Laurie Murray, and to be introduced to his dedicated team of teachers and staff. The students at Kangaroo Ground primary had a great conversation with me and asked many probing questions, and I really enjoyed talking to them about my role as their federal member. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased to visit the Kangaroo Ground Pony Club, where Simon and Mel caught me up on all the club's very busy activities and the support it receives from the local community. Again, I was proud to support the pony club with a $2,000 volunteer grant. This funding will help keep their grounds looking beautiful and suitable for all the equestrian events that are going on there. The members of the club do such a great job of engaging across the community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we approach the fire season, it is very important to acknowledge the work done by our local CFA brigades. In my local community, I was pleased to recently visit the Kangaroo Ground CFA and see the work they're doing around fire preparedness and education. The Kangaroo Ground CFA, with Captain Duncan Bucknell at the helm, is doing important work to make sure our local residents are ready for the fire season. Thank you to all the team there for the work that they're doing and for keeping me updated about the important efforts they're putting in. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a pleasure for me to address the audience at the Banyule Neighbourhood House awards recently, where we celebrated the outstanding contributions of our Neighbourhood Watch team during Community Safety Month. I would like to express my gratitude to Neighbourhood Watch Banyule chair John Dowdle, secretary Lynn Rawson and the entire committee for inviting me to speak at their event. There were 30-year members there, and it's wonderful to see such dedication to keeping our community safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank my state colleague Vicki Ward for hosting her annual catch-up barbecue with our local northern Men's Shed organisations. These Men's Sheds do an exceptional job in engaging local older men as members here well know.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was my absolute pleasure to visit Hohnes Road Playhouse in Eltham, where they showed me their new cubby house village, made possible by a Stronger Communities grant of $6,000. Natalie and Rebecca, who do a great job there, are telling me they're looking forward to seeing the kids play in the new space—just in time for term 4.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr YOUNG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:35</span>):  Out and about in the electorate of Longman, there's no question as we come into Christmas, which should be a joyful time, it's not so joyful for a lot of families. Homelessness in our communities is as high as I've ever seen it. We've got issues with cost of living. And, to top it all off, we've got broken election promises on infrastructure, which we desperately need as our community is growing faster than just about anywhere in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We were promised by the now Prime Minister, during the election campaign, that we would have a desperately needed upgrade from Anzac Avenue to Uhlmann Road to four lanes each way. The Prime Minister announced last week, after the review, that this has been reneged upon. This goes along with the other election promises that we've seen no start on. We have seen no start on the $3 million pledged to the Caboolture rugby league. This goes along with the $3 million pledged for the Narangba Eagles Football Club—again, no start. There's $3 million for a water park at the Centenary Lakes. Again, nothing. Pure crickets. So again, empty promises.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the Longman community is very resilient, and there are some great stories there. It has been my pleasure to attend so many school awards nights over the last couple of weeks. Unfortunately, with sitting weeks, we miss a lot of those, but I can say that the future of Australia looks bright with some of the talent I've seen on show at these awards nights. It was a pleasure to attend Carmichael College, who are growing a grade every year. This year they are up to grade 10; in two more years they'll have their first grade 12 ceremony, which I look forward to being a part of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to give a shout out to a couple of tremendous organisations in Renae's Pantry and the Christian ministers network of Caboolture. Both of these organisations feed homeless people in our community. Renae's Pantry is just a community member who, with two of her friends, feeds 6,000 people a week—a week!—out of her garage. I don't know how—absolutely phenomenal! And I'm pleased to say, when I ventured into my local fish and chip shop that does the best fish and chips in the electorate—sorry to all those other fish and chip shops out there who aren't these guys—Food on King in King Street in Caboolture, they approached me and said they wanted to do something for those who are in need at Christmas time. They're going to open their doors and they're going to feed some of those homeless people in conjunction with either Renae's Pantry or the Christian ministers network.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So even though there's a lot of doom and gloom out there and there's a lot of darkness, there are still lights that shine bright, like Food on King, Renae's Pantry and the Christian ministers network in Caboolture, and I thank them for that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is working with local councils to deliver critical road infrastructure, which will boost productivity, safety and reduce congestion. The 90 kilometres of the Brisbane Valley Highway is receiving $46 million in safety upgrades, and that's being done right now as we speak.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Saturday, I joined the mayor of the Somerset Regional Council, Graeme Lehmann, and councillors to announce a $5 million federal funding contribution towards the Fernvale South Productivity Link project through the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program. This is resurfacing Muckerts Lane, and really converting McCulkins Lane into a Fernvale bypass. This is a terrific project which will support increased traffic volumes and heavier vehicles along existing roads. It will help reduce congestion and wear and tear on the road network by allowing heavy vehicles and other traffic to avoid major roads in the area, particularly the Brisbane Valley Highway. It will reduce travel time for commuters and connect Vernor with Fernvale—a real game changer for the people of that part of the Somerset region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are other high-priority projects in my electorate that need urgent attention and better connectivity across one of the fastest-growing regions in the country. The business case for the Mount Crosby Road interchange on the Warrego Highway has been approved and is proceeding to the design stage, with construction expected to commence in late 2024, subject to funding. I urge the Queensland government to work with the Albanese government to lock in the necessary funding to get it shovel already and start work on this much needed upgrade as soon as possible, as 58,000 vehicles a day go through that interchange.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also look forward to the Queensland government's response on the Cunningham Highway Amberley/Willowbank interchange. It seems to me, on that particular project, the best way forward is to divert the highway south, via a bypass or a grade separation, and make sure only local traffic goes through the interchange to Willowbank, Rosewood and the RAAF base at Amberley. There have been a number of fatal accidents at the interchange and along the highway in recent months, and I support the local community in their calls for a major upgrade of this notorious black spot and bottleneck. I urge the Queensland government to release the outcomes of its community consultation on design options for the interchange, together with further options, as soon as possible. This is absolutely critical for the people in this area, particularly the men and women who work on RAAF Base Amberley.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CALDWELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:41</span>):  I rise today to give an update on some of the work I've had the privilege of undertaking with the schools in my electorate of Fadden. I deeply value education and appreciate the contribution of our local primary and secondary schools in shaping the youth of Fadden. It is where we entrust our kids to be educated and inspired, producing the leaders of future generations, which is why I find it incredibly important to stay up to date with our local schools and to support them wherever possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of my great honours is to bestow schools with an Australian flag that they can fly at their school. I recently attended a special flag-raising ceremony at Biggera Waters State School to unveil the new flag poles that were recently installed at the school. They were jointly funded by the P&amp;C association of the school and by the member for Broadwater and Queensland Leader of the Opposition, David Crisafulli MP.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to have commenced an initiative in conjunction with local schools to recognise and promote well-rounded role models who excel in all aspects of their academic, sporting and cultural endeavours. The Cameron Caldwell MP Leadership Medal recognises high-achieving students who lead by example and demonstrate a high level of enthusiasm and involvement in school activities. It has been an honour to present these awards in recent weeks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was pleased to attend a meeting of the 'precinct P' alliance of schools, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank Clay McCann, the principal of Gainsborough State School, for the tireless work he does for his school and in his capacity as the chair of the alliance. I commend Clay and his colleagues—Dave Hartley, principal of Pimpama State Primary College; Megan Roderick, principal of Pimpama State Secondary College; Heidi MacKenzie, principal of Pimpama State School; and Donna Gosling, principal of Picnic Creek State School—for their collaborative approach to ensuring a quality education for the students in the growing northern Gold Coast.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also recently met with the Helensvale State High School principal, Karen Lindsay, and her leadership team to receive an update on their current programs and initiatives. I was pleased to attend the 2023 academic awards evening, where I presented the inaugural Cameron Caldwell MP Leadership Medal to Ewan Libke. I want to make special mention of the deputy, Tracey Eaton, on an outstanding event to recognise the students of that school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've also been fortunate to reconnect with the Coomera Rivers State School principal, Vic Graham, and Corina Profke, the president of the P&amp;C association, and I look forward to joining the students, staff and families for their Colour Run next week.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:44</span>):  Today I rise to speak in support of the Raise Our Voice in Parliament campaign. This is a fantastic initiative which brings young Australians' voices into the nation's parliament. Australia's youth are one of the most engaged groups of people in our nation, and too often their valuable contributions are not heard. I received several important speeches as part of this year's campaign, and I thank everyone who took the time and effort to contribute a speech. Unfortunately, I can't read them all, but today I will be reading a speech written by one of my constituents, 21-year-old Isabella Gockel.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">A change that would undoubtedly make Australia a better place for future generations would be the passing of laws that protect intersex people's rights.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Unfortunately, many Australians are not aware of the fight for intersex rights, despite its persistence and urgency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Intersex people are people whose sex characteristics, such as their chromosomes or reproductive developments, differ from medical norms for female or male bodies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In all states and territories, except for the ACT, it is legal for unnecessary surgeries to be performed on intersex people without their consent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Doctors are allowed to surgically modify intersex people at birth simply to make their sex characteristics appear more typically male or female.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This harmful practice violates the human rights of intersex people and must be criminalised by all other states and territories. I urge all politicians in this chamber to make intersex rights a priority, and to follow the ACT's lead in protecting intersex people from unnecessary surgeries that occur without their consent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">For too long the right to bodily autonomy has been denied to intersex people. Let's ensure their rights are not denied for a moment longer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you, Isabella, for your thoughtful speech. It's fantastic to see the ACT government leading the way on protecting intersex rights. For too long, the advocacy of the LGBTIQA+ community has fallen on deaf ears, especially when it comes to the unique health challenges they face, particularly for intersex people. I want to let Isabella and all of my constituents know that the Albanese government is taking these challenges and issues incredibly seriously.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why we've committed to developing Australia's first LGBTIQA+ 10-year National Action Plan for the health and wellbeing of LGBTIQA+ people. The expert advisory group leading the development of this plan will target priority issues that will help our government develop a long-term plan for the health and wellbeing of LGBTIQA+ Australians that enables them to lead their best and healthiest lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take this opportunity to thank my colleague Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care Ged Kearney for her work on this and for ensuring that LGBTIQA+ Australians get a seat at the table when it comes to the unique health challenges they face. Once again, I want to thank Isabella and all my constituents who submitted a speech for this campaign. As in previous years, it was difficult to choose just one.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:47</span>):  We are a migrant nation, with more than half of this country being first- or second-generation migrants, and there's a particular relationship with Italian migrants. I know that, in this parliament, the members for Casey and Barker have proud Italian heritage and that the member for Sturt has one of the largest Italian populations in the country. I also have one of the largest in the electorate of Menzies; 8.4 per cent, which is double the national average, are from an Italian heritage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently I had the pleasure of attending the 50th anniversary of the Trevisani nel Mondo gala dinner at the Veneto Club in Melbourne. Treviso is a city in the Veneto region in northern Italy, and the club was formed as a home away from home. That meant so much to people who probably, when they came here, knew that they wouldn't be seeing their relatives again. So to have that place that they could go to was so special. I thank, in particular: the president, Giorgio Paccagnan; Mario Magaton, the vice president; the secretary; the assistant secretary; and the treasurer. All of these things don't happen without a really strong committee. We were also joined by Franco Conte, Tiziano Piovesan and Senator Giacobbe from the Italian Senate. The consul-general was also there, and it was a fantastic event. It was my pleasure to be there with them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also saw recently the celebration of Diwali. Melbourne in particular has a vibrant Indian diaspora. Again, my electorate has that too, and I'm very proud of it. We celebrated Diwali, the festival of light. It's a festival that sees light recognised over darkness, love over hate, good over evil and knowledge over ignorance. I think we can all agree that those are principles and values that we need now more than ever.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to particularly thank Gurpreet Miglani from the Australian Indian Cultural Society Inc. This is a new society that he set up to bring together people in the Manningham district, which overlaps fully with the electorate of Menzies. Again, he couldn't do that without a really significant committee, in particular his vice president, secretary, treasurer and so many others who did an enormous amount of work. Over 300 community members attended their inaugural event, along with vendors, sponsors, performers and volunteers. The Templestowe Football Club also had a stand at the event. I know that Gurpreet Miglani does a lot of work in that club to bring AFL football to the Indian diaspora, and I look forward to the day when we have some players of Indian heritage taking the field at the MCG, playing in the colours of one of the many clubs that we have. Congratulations to Gurpreet and his committee.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:50</span>):  Taiwan provides a clear example of constitutionally enshrined indigenous representation. Taiwan is described as a settler colonial society with a Han Chinese majority and numerous Austronesian-language-speaking first nations people. There are currently 16 officially recognised indigenous tribes in Taiwan, representing more than half a million people. Taiwan's indigenous community makes up about three per cent of the population, which is similar in size to Australia's First Nations people. Taiwan's indigenous communities claim thousands of years of history on the island before the first foreign settlers arrived in the 17th century—400 years ago next year, in fact. Interestingly, Taiwan's constitution sets aside six reserved seats for indigenous peoples, making sure that they're included in the democracy so that they have a voice to parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm talking about Taiwan because my electorate has a very significant Taiwanese diaspora. In fact, they make up around 2.6 per cent of my electorate. The Taiwanese community were very supportive of the 'yes' vote in the Voice to Parliament referendum and were disappointed with the outcome, although we did get to 49.32 per cent for the 'yes' vote in Moreton. Given that they've had indigenous representation in their parliament for many years, the Taiwanese found it hard to comprehend that Australians would have such difficulty with this concept.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I was very pleased to attend the official launch of the Australian Taiwan Indigenous Association Inc. at the Queensland Taiwan Centre on the weekend. This group marks the beginning of a meaningful journey to celebrate, promote and preserve the rich heritage and culture of Taiwan's indigenous communities right here in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This group started as an initiative of Edward Lin, Susan Yang, Melody Chen, Simon Shih, Lianna Cheng and many others who've been involved in assisting a group of young individuals with Taiwanese indigenous backgrounds to establish their own association in Queensland. Susan Yang is heavily involved in the Sunnybank Multicultural Gallery, where they've been presenting artworks related to Taiwanese indigenous culture over the last year. These exhibitions brought together a group of individuals who shared a passion for creating an organisation that would enable them to support each other and share their traditional cultures and arts with the broader Australian community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The association was formally incorporated on 24 August this year, with Mr Ping Chen serving as the president and Ms Ya-Meng Yu as the secretary. The association has primarily focused on highlighting traditional singing and dancing performances—there are some incredible outfits—with a series of performances arranged at a number of upcoming multicultural events. I look forward to working with ATIA and the local First Nations community—my First Nations community on the south side—as our nation works towards reconciliation. We have much to learn.</span>

                  <a href="282981" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:53</span>):  Today I want to talk about what it is that young people really need to thrive—in particular, what young men need to thrive—and to talk about an organisation in my electorate of Moncrieff on the Gold Coast, in the suburb of Southport. There is an organisation there called MOB Academy, Men of Business. It was originally founded by a man, who I'll get to, who supported young men in a park with a physical fitness program. He had an idea of starting an academy that supports young men—wraps around them, helps them with their mental health challenges and concerns, listens to them and cares about them—and builds better men.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, this organisation has built over 450 better men. The way they do it is they have volunteers across their organisation, many of whom stand at the front door every morning, shake the hands of the young men entering their establishment, look them in the eye and ask them how they are. Many of the young men that attend MOB Academy in Southport are in fact homeless. This organisation helps them with life skills, helps them with a physical fitness program and helps them get their drivers licence. They have their own driving school at MOB Academy in Southport.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very proud and pleased to tell this place that the man who founded it along with his partner, Jason Sessarago, has just been named Queensland Australian of the Year. Marco Renai is the rock in my community for young men. He's teaching them how to create a sense of positivity. He's giving them a sense of hope for their future. They are in their communities, in their families, being better men, and what that does is build a much safer and much happier community. The organisation is for at-risk young men, and it has been extraordinarily successful and what it's done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have visited MOB Academy since it was built and I bought a brick myself in support of MOB Academy. I have taken the shadow minister for education and also the Leader of the Opposition to MOB Academy in Southport to show them the wonderful work that Marco Renai and his team at MOB Academy do for young Gold Coast boys. Building better men is what they do. Congratulations to the whole team at MOB Academy for making such a big difference in the lives of the Gold Coast's young men.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265980" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SHARKIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:00</span>):  I rise to speak on this very important motion put forward by the member for Gippsland about the Stronger Communities Program. I think it's fair to say, certainly in my electorate, that there was no grant round more anticipated and more appreciated by my community than the Stronger Communities Program. Even though it was small and even though it was only $150,000 every year to every electorate, the good that that did in my community was profound. And I've got to say I think it's the most mean-spirited decision of government to cease this program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last round, round 8, 20 projects were funded in Mayo. We had 65 applications, worth more than $800,000. The projects that were successful were things such as a storage shed for the Hills Archers. The Cudlee Creek Tennis Club—and many people in this community would remember that the region of Cudlee Creek was the epicentre of the fires in my community in that summer of 2019-20—received funding for solar panel installation to help with their resilience. The Gumeracha Community Association purchased a community trailer. The Hope Forest Residents Association upgraded their community hall. The Torrens Valley Community Kindergym got just a little bit of funds to help with some mats for the kids. Down at the Cape Jervis rec and sport club, there was funding for kitchen and hall facility upgrades. There was funding for the Hahndorf Town Band, for trailer upgrades; the Strath Neighbourhood Centre, for IT facilities; and Encounter Centre, for the construction of a storage shed. The Lobethal Archives and Historical Museum received $5,000 to assist with their museum and chapel restoration and repairs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think what's incredibly frustrating is that we have seen projects year on year in my community—over the time that I've been the member, we've had six rounds—and we've had over 400 expressions of interest, so no-one can deny that this is a program that is wanted desperately in our community. We've funded 114 different projects—small projects. And the great challenge is that this program was more valued in regional Australia because our councils don't own our ovals and don't own our sporting clubs; they don't manage them and they don't fund them. So we fundraise constantly just to cover insurance, which has gone up exponentially over those years. And so to take away this small grant program that allowed organisations in my community that are run by volunteers and managed entirely by our community—and for us to not have a small bucket of money that could be equitably distributed to fund necessary upgrades and equipment—is just appalling, really. I just can't understand the short-sightedness of the government in doing this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't have big councils with deep pockets that fund all of this. We don't just call some project manager and say: 'Come and fix this. This is not working.' We fundraise and fundraise, we cover the costs ourselves and we are self-reliant. And so not to have the funds, not to be able to upgrade small things—the Milang and District Community Association received $5,000 to install a split-system air conditioner in their youth space. These are little things. We're barely covering the cost of fundraising for our insurance and just maintaining our halls and our parks. To not be able to have this round of money really hurts regions. It really hurts regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite it going to every electorate, it was desperately needed in my community, and just those small little things made the world of difference. It could have helped down at the Aldinga Bay Surf Life Saving Club, helping them get some surfboards for young people who can't afford them, to be able to have that kind of program happening. It could have helped the Hahndorf Academy Foundation fit out their community arts and culture space. It could have helped out at Wistow with their community hall—and let's not forget, our community halls are also, in most cases, the place of last resort, the refuge for our communities, especially for our communities at risk of bushfires.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And so, I would urge the minister: Minister, do the right thing, and fund this. In fact, do it better. Fund it more than $150,000 per electorate, because over the years that $150,000 can't buy what it used to buy. Truely, I am appalled. It is the most mean-spirited decision that I have seen from this government in 18 months. Thank you. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249710" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:05</span>):  I did want to speak to this motion and just put a few facts on the table about what has actually happened to the Stronger Communities Program. It has existed now for eight rounds, and the eighth round was funded by our government in the October budget. The previous government, the Liberal-Nationals, announced there would be a round 8, but did not announce that there would be a round 9, a round 10 or beyond. The round 8 was not funded. Whilst it was in their budget, they did not implement their budget prior to calling the election. Upon coming to government, the Albanese Labor government funded round 8 in the October 2022 budget, and it is currently rolling out throughout our electorates right now. Those opposite didn't deliver the funding for round 8, and certainly didn't deliver or recommend or suggest or even talk about rounds beyond this round. The program wasn't ended by this government, it was ended by the previous government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the information of those who have spoken in this debate, funding has been allocated and $150,000 is available. Each electorate gets $150,000 and has to decide on how to spend that for up to 20 local projects. Our electorates work hard; most of us have independent committees that make recommendations after an expressions-of-interest process. Funding of between $2,500 to $20,000 is available for not-for-profit community organisations and local government to fund small capital works projects that deliver benefits to communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the years, I have seen that this investment has made a difference in areas of my electorate. Only on the weekend I was talking about one of the early projects, the funding of our local First Nations talking tram that tells our First Nations people's story as people jump on the tram and travel through our community. The project has helped sporting clubs buy equipment to help maintain their ovals. Even though a lot of our infrastructure in Greater Bendigo, Mount Alexander and the Macedon Ranges is owned by local government, these grants have allowed clubs to partner with local government to help deliver upgrades and needs. Other successful groups include our toy libraries and our community houses. This project has significantly helped a lot of community houses in our area, but as I have said from the beginning, we are always oversubscribed. I do believe that it is time to look at how we can better partner with community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I will say about this fund, when it comes to the regions, is that I don't believe that it does support our regions in the way it should. It isn't equitable. You cannot compare the needs of a regional electorate to the needs of a city based electorate. Some of our electorates are incredibly small, they're less than 20 kilometres wide, and yet they get the same amount of money allocated to them as a regional electorate. In every one of my regional towns, I have sporting fields, I have RSLs, I have community houses. I cannot stretch that $150,000 fairly. I also know that some of our metro members actually ring up the local council and say: 'What projects are you funding? Can I tap into that?' These electorates are so small they're able to do it in a way, if they're in town, where they have a lot more resources. It isn't fairly distributed between the need and the want that we have in our electorates, so $150,000 in a regional electorate doesn't go far enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It also, in a regional electorate, doesn't get to the real projects that really need a lot of attention. We have sporting grounds, where we are trying to desperately upgrade our change rooms and our equipment. But $20,000 doesn't get you an upgraded change room; $20,000 doesn't get you the lighting that you need to be able to use that change room. It may get you a new sink, it may get you a new bit of playing equipment, but it doesn't deal with the real infrastructure needs that a lot of our regions are crying out to be fixed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do believe it is time to rethink how we do community investment and infrastructure in our regions, and it is wrong for those opposite to say that we have cut the program. It was their government that didn't fund it beyond round 8 or even talk about beyond round 8. They threw it out there as an opportunity to pork barrel in an election so that MPs could make local commitments. That is not good enough. If we're genuine about funding projects in the regions and in our outer metro areas, then we need a fund which is accountable, which is a competitive tender and which genuinely delivers what regions need. To all those groups that have done well in my electorate, congratulations, but I believe we can do better when it comes to community infrastructure. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VAN MANEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forde</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:10</span>):  I think the member for Bendigo—as much as I like her—has made a valiant effort to defend an appalling decision by this government. It doesn't matter how much the member for Bendigo tries to sugar-coat the decision by the government to not continue funding the Stronger Communities Programme. It is an appalling decision, and it's our communities that pay the price. As the member for Bendigo quite rightly pointed out, every electorate in this country was treated equally under the Stronger Communities Programme. The fact that she could get up here and have the gall to say that it was pork-barrelling in the lead-up to an election and to complain that the coalition government hadn't funded it in perpetuity just shows how little regard they have for our communities. It is a disgraceful decision, and our communities will pay the price. Our communities will pay the price through the loss of funding for small organisations right across our communities that benefited from these small capital grants.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was proud of the coalition government when we introduced this program in the 2015-16 budget because we all know how much work our community organisations do each and every day to make our communities better places to live in. Many of them survive on the smell of an oily rag. Giving them the ability to get a little bit of money to help with a new piece of equipment et cetera to make their jobs easier and provide better services is what this fund was designed to do. In addition, the beauty of this program was that the application process and the expression of interest process was straightforward. Because many of these community organisations are run by volunteers, they don't have the skills, the time or the ability to write detailed funding applications. So the expression of interest process was straightforward and easy for them to complete and document. Then, as I'm sure was the case for many colleagues in this chamber, we had a community board that would go through those expressions of interest and make decisions on what was approved and funded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I look through the projects funded across my electorate since this became available, I see that funds went to a local motocross club for a new first-aid and parents room and to community centres to purchase new washing machines and dryers to provide laundry facilities for those in our community who are struggling. It's been an invaluable resource for the community, particularly now with the cost-of-living crisis, and it is a resource for those who are struggling with homelessness. There were also funds for the mini farm project that I went to see last week at Loganlea State High School. The charity converts underutilised spaces into urban farms to grow food for those in need. With support from many great sponsors across our community, they are delivering record amounts of food to our charities to provide free of charge to those in need. Those people are getting fresh vegetables from our urban farm. There were funds for our local school of arts to refurbish their facilities at Cedar Creek hall to improve access for the community; the Logan Make and Do Association, for purchasing some new lathes to build toys for those in the community, for Christmas presents et cetera; the Ormeau Progress Association, for renovations to their facilities; the Rotary Club of Beenleigh, for a maternity garden at Logan Hospital; the Phoenix Ensemble, for upgrading electrical systems in their theatre; and a range of other initiatives right around my community of Forde.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Without these small community-focused funding initiatives provided through the Stronger Communities Program, many of these grassroots organisations would go without. We've seen on the ground how successful and how important it is. I call on this Labor government, with now a $22 billion budget surplus, to show some heart and reinstate the stronger communities fund to provide support to our community organisations who do so much good work each and every day to make our communities a better place in which to live.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:15</span>):  I rise to speak against the motion moved by the member for Gippsland. In doing so I'm trying not to choke on the hypocrisy of this motion, as it appears the member is trying to claim that future years of the Stronger Communities Program have not been funded, when his own government failed to fund the round announced in March 2022. This is a program that has been traditionally funded year on year, and it is ridiculous for the coalition government to claim they did not do the same.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I move on, let's not forget the fallout from the Building Better Regions Fund program. The Australian National Audit Office found that the former government not only actively ignored Commonwealth grants guidelines but tried to get around them, and they did so at the expense of regional seats—not only Labor seats but also regional seats held by Liberal and Independent members. It looked like coalition ministers made decisions on projects based on an adventure of their own making, and, as a result, projects on the merit list were ignored and 65 per cent of the projects in the infrastructure stream, which made up almost all the billion dollars, were not the ones assessed by the department as having the most merit. The Liberals and Nationals announced round 8 of stronger communities in the March budget but failed to pass their budget before calling an election, meaning the program was another unfunded promise. As usual, big on announcements—but no delivery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us put some facts on the table. The Albanese Labor government delivered the funding for round 8 of the program in the October budget of 2022 and rolled the program out across 2023. The program allocated $22.7 million to support community organisations and councils to deliver much-needed local projects. Funding of between $2½ thousand and $20,000 was available for not-for-profit community organisations and local governments to fund small capital projects that deliver social benefits and boost local community participation, including small-scale infrastructure upgrades, fit outs and equipment purchases. Each federal electorate received a capped amount of $150,000 to fund up to 20 local projects.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government has committed $200 million over two years, commencing in 2024-25, to establish the new Thriving Suburbs Program to deliver investment in locally driven urban and suburban infrastructure and community projects. The program will help address priority community infrastructure by providing access to funding for capital works and for community and economic infrastructure that enhances liveability and prosperity in urban and suburban communities. The program will be open and competitive, with grants awarded on a merit basis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government's $400 million Regional Precincts and Partnerships Program is now open for applications. The rPPP seeks to support investment in regional, rural and remote Australia based on the principles of unifying regional places, growing economies and serving communities. The government has also committed $150 million over three years, commencing in 2024-25, for the Urban Precincts and Partnerships Program that will support investment in urban Australia based on the same principles. And let us not forget that the government secured $500 million for the Housing Support Program to help local communities with the urgent task of housing delivery. The regions have not been overlooked, with the Albanese government's new $600 million Growing Regions Program, which opened for expressions of interest in July. This provides grants of between $500,000 and $15 million to local government entities and not-for-profit organisations for capital works projects that deliver community and economic infrastructure projects right across regional and rural Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, overall, when it comes to grants, what is in and what is out? In—great programs, like the Growing Regions Program, with proper guidelines and processes. What is out? Ignoring guidelines and proper processes in favour of pork-barrelling the scheme for their own electoral advantage, as undertaken by the Liberals and Nationals previously. It is nonsense to suggest that the Albanese government has failed to provide funding for important local government community projects. In fact, just the opposite is true. We are committed to supporting our local councils and communities and to delivering grant programs that are fair and transparent.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="008CH" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms DANIEL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:20</span>):  I am concerned that this government has yet to confirm an extension of the Stronger Communities Program, under which community organisations and local governments can apply for grants to fund small capital projects. As the member for Gippsland's motion states:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(b) community groups, already struggling with the increased cost of living, will have no other option than to fundraise for projects that otherwise could have been funded under the programme—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the motion points out, it's arguable that, amid high inflation, community organisations now have greater need than ever. These grants must be confirmed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was elected, I promised to judge all initiatives on their merit, on the evidence and on the data—no deals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This followed rorting under the previous government, which infuriated my community and others. There should be grants to worthy community organisations. However, those that do go ahead should be based on need and equity, selected by a fair and proper process. In Goldstein, I have no part in the process of allocating community grants. The community evaluation committee that I have set up includes representatives from the two local councils and a Goldstein constituent with professional grant-making experience, plus one staff member from my office, who is a retired auditor. This group decides on much-needed grant applications from small community organisations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These grants are much appreciated by the groups that received them to assist in their work for and within our community. Take, for example, Bayside Community Information and Support Service, which received a Stronger Communities grant of over $11,000 in the last round to purchase vital equipment to enable the provision of more emergency relief, information, referral, advocacy and support for vulnerable, at-risk, homeless and low-income individuals and families in our community. Goldstein may be one of the wealthiest electorates in the country, but it has its pockets of poverty. I know of women sleeping in cars in council and shopping centre car parks and of women separated from their long-time partners, unable to pay the rates or maintain, heat or cool their homes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nearly a dozen other community and sporting groups received funds for such improvements as a shade cloth and a barbecue for a neighbourhood community house and a battery storage system to support existing solar panels. A local lifesaving club received funding for a trailer to store and carry nipper boards to the beach. These grants enhance community amenity and participation. However, the last round of the program in my electorate was four and a half times oversubscribed. One community sporting club missed out on portable soccer goalposts; another on improved drainage for its oval. New energy-efficient floodlights were rejected for another applicant, as were solar panels for a scout hall and sports uniforms for junior players. Money does not grow on trees, but, especially since the social disruption of COVID, community activities are even more important and to be encouraged. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a related matter, I'm thankful to the government for acting speedily to activate the Securing Faith-Based Places program, Labor's replacement for the last government's Safer Communities program. Several Jewish institutions in Goldstein will be able to enhance security as a result, which is much-needed right now. However, Safer Communities has an important element missing from the new program. For example, the Rotary Club of Brighton, in my electorate, after discussion with local police, was able to fund uniforms and registration fees for at-risk teenagers and young adults from families facing financial hardship to take part in team sports. So far, Brighton rotary has encouraged and assisted 85 kids into doing a number of sports, including AFL, soccer, basketball, netball and hockey, under the Team Sport 4 All program. Unfortunately, Brighton rotary have told me that their grant will run out at the end of the financial year, and, under this government, there is no longer any obvious avenue for such a grant. The question is: what plans does the government have—and, if so, when will they tell us—or are they simply going to let it wither on the vine?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year, the local government minister announced the Growing Regions Program, a replacement for the Thriving Regions Fund. There was supposed to be a replacement, too, for the Thriving Communities Fund, a similar program for local government and not-for-profits in metropolitan Australia. The Growing Regions Program is about to open its second round of expressions of interest, but its suburban sister has not appeared, and there has been not a peep about this from the government. Where is it and, without it, how do we expect our communities to thrive? </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:25</span>):  The member for Gippsland has brought this motion in relation to a grant program. That's a pretty gutsy thing for the member to do, given the atrocious record of the coalition on grants programs over the last few years before we came to office. The member has chosen what he must think is the coalition's least-rorted grants program—that's a matter of perspective and something we have to judge relative to others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the Building Better Regions Fund was heavily rorted. The Auditor-General found that almost two-thirds of the money in that scheme, run by a series of Nationals ministers, went to projects that did not have the most merit. And what did the member for New England say? He said he didn't care if people called it pork-barrelling. Well, we do care, and the Australian people care and voted accordingly, and we are fixing the system now.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The commuter car park program was heavily rorted by the coalition. According to the National Audit Office, a list of the top 20 marginal electorates guided the distribution of $389 million from the pork-and-ride fund, with 77 per cent in coalition electorates rather than in areas of true congestion needs.</span>

It was the whole culture of the Liberal and National government that was at fault.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a positive, look at the new, transparent and fair grants that are now available to communities under this government. The Thriving Suburbs Grant, $200 million commencing from next year, is an investment in locally driven urban and suburban infrastructure and community projects. The Urban Precincts and Partnerships Program has $150 million commencing from next year, investing in urban infrastructure, connecting people and communities and services and opportunities that improve liveability and inclusion. </span>

                  </a>  Well, we'll find out from next year when the grant commences. There will be a far better process because we believe in integrity and transparency. That's how we'll deliver. The Housing Support Program is another $500 million competitive funding program for local and state governments that will kickstart housing supply. The Growing Regions Program has $600 million over three years that will provide grants of between $500,000 and $15 million to local government entities and not-for-profit organisations for capital works programs that deliver economic and community infrastructure projects across regional and rural Australia. Round 2 opens later this year, and the Regional Precincts and Partnerships Program, now at $400 million, will be open for applications to deliver regional precincts that are tailored to local needs.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Growing Regions Program and the Regional Precincts and Partnerships Program won't apply to Hasluck because we are not regional, but they will apply to the seat of Gippsland. These are initiatives that the Albanese government backs in because it supports regional Australia. Instead of writing this motion, the member for Gippsland could have written to his constituents to tell them about the Growing Regions Program, to which not-for-profit community organisations and local governments in Gippsland can apply to fund small-capital projects that deliver social benefits and boost local community participation, including small-scale infrastructure upgrades, fit outs and equipment purchases. He can tell them that each federal electorate has a capped amount of $150,000 to fund up to 20 local projects. He can also assure them that, under an Albanese Labor government, the processes for application will be fair and transparent.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are volunteer grants offered across all electorates to assist eligible not-for-profit community organisations supporting the efforts of their volunteers. Past successful groups in Hasluck, like the Mundaring Toy Library, CLAN—Community Link and Network—Midland, and the Ellenbrook Cultural Foundation have been able to extend and strengthen their connections and the work that they do in their local communities with the help of those volunteer grants. When our local groups applied for them, they had to fill out full applications. They had to follow the rules. They had to do everything by the book. They have every right to expect that their applications will be assessed and treated with the same level of honesty, transparency and proper process. Under this government, that's exactly what will happen. I thank the member Gippsland for bringing this courageous motion and allowing me to outline some of the government's initiatives which will assist people in both Gippsland and Hasluck as well as across the nation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWS" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAMSEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:30</span>):  Let me say from the outset how surprised, shocked and disappointed I was that the government decided to cancel the Stronger Communities Programme. In my experience, and I've been here quite a while, I've never seen a program that managed to have such a multiplier effect. These were small grants going into active, community based clubs and organisations that had the ability to galvanise their members and generate so much more off the back of those particular programs. In Grey, we've had eight rounds, like everyone else, and that adds up to $1.2 million going back into Grey. I have to say, given some of the projects funded under the last government that have gone back into an electorate like Grey, $22 million a year is a drop in the bucket to the federal budget. Yet, as I drive around and talk to the community groups and as they ring my office looking for the next round of grants, I am constantly amazed by the amount of work that has been done on the back of what is a relatively minor grant and by its ability to enable these community organisations to access funds to bring their dreams alive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Grey it's been for things as diverse as breathing equipment for CFS units, gymnastics clubs, swimming clubs and business groups. Some of the communities that have benefited most have been the smallest and most remote—those with the most disadvantage. In my electorate, I've always elected to do this by an exhaustive committee process. I've had five members that sit on a panel, and we meet, at least virtually, to go through what is often an ask list four or five times greater than the amount of grants available. These people come from a wide footprint, and they're well informed community members across the electorate. We've all found it a really good process to focus our minds on what's going on in our local communities and where the needs are.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This has come at a time when the government has also cancelled, or perhaps relabelled, the Building Better Regions Fund, which put more than $60 million in the electorate of Grey and has been very, very useful to get some bigger projects over the finishing line. I am aware that we have the Growing Regions Program, but, of course, one of the unfortunate things about this new one is that it has a $1 million minimum price tag. If you're living where the majority of people live in my electorate, you'll be eligible for up to 50 per cent of the funding. Those who live in the outer regional areas will only require 25 per cent. For a smaller community organisation to be expected to find half a million dollars—it's virtually thrown directly at councils, certainly in the electorate of Grey, as the only organisations likely to be able to access those funds in the future. It will just make everything so much harder.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the promises from the government before the election, we've also seen issues with the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program. They said, 'We will put more money into it.' That is technically true. They funded a half round that is for roads only and then axed the program. I'd have to say that that is one of the most disappointing things for local councils that are struggling to hold road networks together. How hard do you push people in a high inflation environment for council rates and all those things? It's just a sign that the government is walking away from rural and regional programs. We just heard the previous speaker waxing lyrical about their urban schemes. I interjected to ask how many of those are in National Party electorates or Liberal Party electorates, as she'd just spent the last three or four minutes bagging those particular parties and the previous grants rounds. It seems quite obvious that the dial has turned now and they're making sure that the rivers of gold from government flow in another direction, and that's to their electorates. And I think, considering their rhetoric on this area, that's pretty reprehensible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think my community made good selections. There's an absolute delight that this program brings to people in local communities, and you'd be aware of it yourself, Madam Deputy Speaker. Organisations that have tried so hard to get good projects off the ground for their communities say to us, 'Well, you cannot believe how that $5000, $10,000 or $12,251'—because we often pare them down a little bit to see what we can get out of that community. But it's sorely missed, and they are asking, 'Where are we going to go now?'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">After nearly a decade of mismanagement and neglect from the Liberals, the Albanese Labor government is delivering on our commitment to create a fairer industrial setting for Australian workers. Central to this commitment was our promise to get wages moving again after years of deliberate wage suppression by the Liberal Party. In the 10 years before Labor came to government, the Liberals oversaw flatlining real wages, the worst decade for productivity in over 50 years and the accumulation of a trillion dollars of Liberal debt. Australian workers were being left out in the cold, and our economy was suffering as a result.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why repairing our industrial relations system and investing in our workforce was a central part of our election platform 18 months ago and remains a central part of our agenda today. We understand that delivering strong wage growth and improved conditions for Australian workers will not only put more money in workers' pockets but also set our economy up to be more prosperous into the future. Strong and sustainable wages growth is a deliberate design feature of our economic plan to lift productivity and grow the economic pie for all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, the Albanese Labor government is committed to lifting the wages of minimum and award wage earners. In our very first week in government, as part of the annual wage review, we made a submission to the Fair Work Commission arguing that, when the cost of living is rising, our lowest-paid workers shouldn't be going backwards. In response to our submission and to many others, the national minimum wage was increased by 5.2 per cent. With the cost of living continuing to put pressure on workers, we made the same argument again this year, and the national minimum wage was increased by 8.6 per cent, while award wages increased by 5.75 per cent. These increases are the largest on record and will ensure that millions of Australians, including in my electorate of Hawke, will receive a fair wage in exchange for their hard work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government has also made significant changes to industrial relations laws to lift pay and conditions of workers more broadly. Our secure jobs, better pay bill, which passed last year, was the first step. It restored balance at the bargaining table, improving the capacity of workers to get a fair deal while also lifting pay equity and job security. The next step is our closing the loopholes bill, which is currently before the House. The legislation will close the labour hire loophole that companies use to undercut genuine workplace agreements, empower the Fair Work Commission to set minimum standards for gig workers, improve pathways to permanent employment and, importantly, criminalise wage theft.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The evidence is clear that the Albanese Labor government's legislative agenda is delivering the wage growth that we promised. Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows that the average full-time worker earned 3.9 per cent, or $3,700, more in the first year of this Labor government. Excluding during the pandemic, this is the fastest rate in a decade and significantly faster than the 2.4 per cent average under the previous Liberal government. In fact, the average worker is $1,400 better off thanks to the increasing wages growth under the Albanese Labor government compared to if wages had continued their trajectory under the Liberals.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the clear success of our advocacy and legislative changes, we have unfortunately not enjoyed bipartisan support. Indeed, not content with their abysmal decade in government, the Liberals continue to attempt to keep wages low for Australian workers at every turn. Indeed, at every opportunity the Liberals have not only tried to stop our efforts to see workers fairly compensated, but they have also ignored the evidence that sustainable and sensible wage increases are exactly what our economy needs. The Liberals suppression of wages brought with it a record decline in productivity growth and left our economy incredibly vulnerable.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:40</span>):  There we have it: 'The Australian public have never had it better. How lucky is the Australian public?' I want to commend the member for Hawke for this motion. I don't think I could see a better motion that actually highlights how out of touch the Albanese government actually is. Wages are up. Of course they're up, because inflation is through the roof. What they don't talk about is real wages. They were happy to talk a lot about real wages during the election campaign—and let's be honest, this is another example of ALP spin. They think if they put a few numbers in a motion that the public won't understand that it's harder than ever. But real wages are crucial, because that's wage growth and inflation; it's whether you have more money in your pocket every week to pay the bills and enjoy your life.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what did the Treasurer, when he was shadow Treasurer, say about real wages in the election? On 21 November 2021, he said:</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… petrol prices are skyrocketing, real wages are going down and working families are going backwards, and I think that should be central to an election about the economy, about living standards and about the Prime Minister's failures on economic management.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was the shadow Treasurer on 21 November 2021 on real wages. He was very clear. I could have pulled out hundreds and hundreds of quotes from those opposite about real wages.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">And what did the then opposition leader now Prime Minister say? He said, 'It's about the failure of economic management.' Quoting then opposition leader Anthony Albanese on 17 March, he said, 'A Labor government will lower the cost of living.' On 1 May, in his campaign launch speech—so it's not on the fly, it's not off a question; this was prepared and in his campaign launch speech. He said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We talked about wages before and we talked about real wages, and I note the member for Hawke didn't want to give any numbers on real wages. Let's look at how they've gone under this government: September 2022, real wages were negative 4.1 per cent for the quarter; December 2022, real wages were negative 4.4 per cent for the quarter; March 2023, real wages were negative 3.3 per cent for the quarter; and June 2023, real wages were negative 2.4 per cent for the quarter. And this government insults the Australian people by coming in here today and patting themselves on the back and telling themselves what a great job they're doing. Well the Australian public have worked them out. They know they've been distracted for the first 18 months of this government. They know they have no plans to make life easier for Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 12 months to June, Australian household income fell 5.1 per cent. That's the most in the OECD. The UK, as a comparison, up 2.2 per cent. The US, up 3.5 per cent. And our friends in Spain, up six per cent. You'll hear spin from this Prime Minister and this Treasurer talking about global factors. Well, those factors are not impacting Spain, and they're not impacting the US or the UK. Every other country in the OECD is doing better on household income than Australia. What's the common thread? It's the Albanese Labor government, which has no plans for addressing the cost of living for the Australian people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite talk about the independent Fair Work Commission. They're very happy to put in this motion how great it is that there was a minimum pay rise for the lowest earners—the work of the independent Fair Work Commission—but it's more spin. When the independent Reserve Bank of Australia increases interest rates, they walk away from the Reserve Bank at a million miles an hour. They'll take all the credit for the independent Fair Work Commission, but they'll pass the buck on the independent Reserve Bank of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every time there is an economic decision to be made in this country, this government makes the wrong decision, and Australians know it. They feel it every time they go to the petrol browser. Petrol was $2.25 per litre when I was driving to the airport last night. They were happy to complain when it was $1.79, but they've got no plans to improve the cost of living for Australians, and we all know it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:46</span>):  I thank the member for Hawke for this important motion, as it gives me the opportunity to reflect upon our government's record in getting the policy settings on wages moving in the right direction after some very dark times under the Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments. Those opposite believe their legacy to be saturated in a non-stick coating when it comes to any form of accountability. To them, it's an art form. Both in this place and in the media, those opposite debate on wages, interest rates, inflation and the economy with the subtlety of a sledgehammer and a cutting edge to match. They go about this debate, particularly during an MPI, as if our economy exists in some Petri dish—a controlled environment that ignores both external economic pressures and any negative consequences of the actions taken when they were in government. Many measures required begging and pleading for them to implement, especially once we'd seen what other developed nations were doing to keep their economies going.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the afterglow of governments in developed economies spending big, central banks across the world raised interest rates. The RBA did precisely that while those opposite were in government, although they are not so eager to claim credit for any of that. They suddenly appear very humble about their role in this. Why is that? Their conduct in opposition is as hard to swallow as anything you try to drink from a 'back in black' coffee mug—a real collector's item. It's the cognitive dissonance for me. Recently, I heard comments in the media from Senator Hume, as part of a heated debate about inflation, and we saw exactly this: zero liability, total credit for the by-products that contributed to it, and zero credibility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Their arguments about defining what constitutes good and bad debt or spending were always political, not economic. One government's debt and budget deficits are another's debt and deficit disaster. With those opposite, there are a handful of things you can count on. You can count on them, in government or in opposition, to do everything they can to keep wages down. It's important to note this, as real wage growth takes two to tango—wage growth moving to outpace inflation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's examine what they really think about the wages of everyday Australians going up. For starters, they baked low wage growth into their economic policy. Many of us still vividly remember when the former finance minister—no, not the member for Cook, but Mattias Cormann—accidentally said the quiet part out loud and proudly admitted to low wage growth being not just a reality through the lifespan of their government but, in fact, government policy. I don't know why they are so coy about this now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite, when in government—even to the bitter end—had the audacity to attack Labor for standing up for the lowest paid workers in Australia and making submissions to raise the minimum wage. This led to a 5.2 per cent increase to the minimum wage last year, with a further 8.6 per cent increase awarded by the Fair Work Commission earlier this year. Did the opposition consider this to be positive, or did they criticise this as being dangerous and inflationary? I think by now the answer should be obvious. Where were those opposite when the Albanese government moved to lift wages for our workers in aged care? It's a sector with some of the lowest paid workers, a sector that needs more workers today and will need even more workers tomorrow, and a sector that employs thousands of people within my electorate of Spence. However, by listening to members opposite speak on industrial relations over the past few sitting weeks, it is clear that their response to wage raises has been, 'Now is not the time'—every single time. They didn't even have a plan to curb inflation when they saw it rising, and they still don't. This is coupled with a policy on wages growth that can at best be described as Darwinian. They have the gall to complain that real wages aren't rising fast enough when they did nothing to stop inflation creeping steadily higher on their watch, and had their finger on the scale of wage increases during their time in government. Unlike those opposite, an Albanese Labor government pledges strong and sustainable wage growth as a deliberate design feature of our economic plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As inflation continues to moderate, our government will continue with our policies on wage growth, doing so alongside sensible cost-of-living relief, all while those opposite continue to play backseat—or maybe backbench—driver. They continue to play politics and offer little other than a rolled-goal assurance that they would have done better somehow.</span>

Sadly, it's a tale of woe I bring because, having listened to the previous two government speakers, I can say Marie Antoinette could not have done it by herself—let them eat cake! Real wages might be going backwards, but let them have nominal wage growth! It's so out of touch, so condescending and so untethered to even the slightest bound of reality. Real wages have gone backwards. Inflation has outstripped wages growth, which means that when you do see a nominal wage increase you are going backwards because your doll is worth less. The value of your dollar is shrinking faster than your pay is rising. In fact, the only thing shrinking faster than the value of your dollar is this government's commitment to tackling inflation. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Crowing about nominal wage growth might sound great in here, but out in the real world, out in the working-class suburbs that are walking away from Labor—as the polling shows for this Whitlam-era government—real wage growth is what matters, and real wage growth is going backwards. People of Australia, if you're wondering why you are being paid more but can afford less—this is why. Real wage growth is going backwards. The cost of everything is going up faster than your wages are. This is because this government have refused to drive down inflation and commit to it. They tried their hardest to lay the blame on the war in Ukraine at the start, but that is no longer the case. They tried to tell us that every economy is in the same boat, but the UK is the only country, amongst modern Western nations, that has higher inflation than us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor have a problem, but the situation didn't need to be this bad. Over the last 18 months, Labor simply have not done enough to tame inflation—their focus has been elsewhere. Australia, are you worried about how big your grocery bill will be next week? Don't fret, because this government have an Assistant Minister for the Republic! How's that for laser-like focus on the big issues? Are you worried about your next energy bill? Don't fret, because this government just wasted 18 months on a referendum that could not have been more soundly defeated! Are you worried about the latest interest rates rise and what it will lose your mortgage? Don't fret, because last summer the Treasurer wrote 6,000 words on how he's going to rewrite capitalism! Australia, inflation is an issue for you because it's not an issue for Labor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What have Labor done in government? Let us apply some generosity here. They've increased spending by $185 billion. They've put on, as we saw over the weekend, another 10,000 public servants just here in Canberra. They've introduced productivity-killing pattern-bargaining, despite promising they wouldn't, and investment-killing price caps on the gas industry. They've opened the floodgates to more than half a million more people coming to Australia in the middle of a housing crisis. That's what they've done. What has been the result? Sadly, rents are rising about their highest rates since 2009. As we have heard many times, repayments on a $750,000 mortgage are up by $22,000. Workers are paying 15 per cent more on their income tax, and gas bills are rising and will continue to rise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nominal wage growth will not fix these problems, and these problems are important and very relevant because these are the exact promises Labor made to the Australian people to get them into government. Labor promised, 'We will be doing our bit to assist real wage increases.' They haven't done that. They have failed on that. Real wages are going backwards, and they're going backwards at a shocking rate. Labor promised cheaper mortgages—tell me anyone who has experienced that. Labor promised to cut your electricity bill by $275. That hasn't happened either. Labor promised lower inflation. This government haven't kept their promises. Now they are trying to tell us that nominal wage growth is more important than real wage decline.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm surprised this motion even got through the government's tactics committee, quite frankly, after the ABC, that great mouthpiece of Labor vitriol and propaganda, could not even bring itself to swallow this sort of nonsense. When the Treasurer tried to claim that the average full-time worker is $3,700 better off per year under Labor, the ABC found that to be misleading. Not even their ABC could support their position. On this point, isn't it extraordinary that this government, which have been called out by the ABC for misleading the public on an issue so significant and unequivocal as the financial situation of Australian workers, is the government that wants to bring about a bill on misinformation?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note point 4 on this motion moves that the House 'acknowledges this is another example of the government working for Australia and delivering on our election commitments to build a better future for Australians'. Once again, how out of touch could you possibly be? In a Resolve poll, just eight per cent of Australians expect the economy to improve in the next 12 months. They don't think Labor is building a better future. Sixty-four per cent think inflation will worsen. Here's the good one: 60 per cent of Australians do not think their incomes have kept up with inflation over the past year. Sixty is an interesting number. It's the same percentage of people who soundly rejected the government's position on the Voice. Once again, this Labor government is so out of touch with the Australian people, and it could not have more of a hurtful impact at this time.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="263547" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:55</span>):  I'd like to begin by thanking the member for Hawke for moving this important motion today. Wages growth under the Albanese government is working, and locals in my electorate are telling me that it is making a difference to their lives. I recently visited Torquay's aged-care workers at Villa Maria Catholic Homes Star of the Sea, who were celebrating a 15 per cent wage rise after the Fair Work Commission's much anticipated increase to award rates earlier this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is here that I met Sarbjeet Kaur, a generous-hearted young woman who simply wants to give back to her community. That's why she grasped fee-free TAFE with both hands, completing an aged-care course at Gordon TAFE. She now works in my electorate of Corangamite. Sarbjeet told me she believed the wage rise was helpful and would attract others to the profession. It's not an easy job, and their wages have been too low for too long. Sarbjeet also said fee-free TAFE has helped her to get the job that she truly cares about. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I really enjoy this job. Sometimes I feel like crying when I see the residents. We are here for them. We care for them. We try to give everything for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These words are heartfelt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government recognises that better wages mean a better life. We also recognise that a wage incentive will encourage more Australians to train and work in sectors such as aged care, where we need more carers—more carers like Sarbjeet. That's why our government and the Minister for Aged Care have acted, with a significant 15 per cent wage increase for aged-care workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From meeting with workers and residents at Torquay, I was pleased to hear the government's reforms had been embraced by local workers and businesses. The staff are doing amazing work on the Surf Coast. Star of the Sea's acting CEO, David Williamson, expressed his support for the government's reforms, noting the pay rise was recognition of the important work of nurses and care staff. He was hopeful the boost would attract more workers to his organisation, given the current sector-wide workforce shortage challenges.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to wages growth, we are working for Australia across a number of fronts. The Albanese government has delivered the first budget surplus in 15 years and seen wages grow at the fastest rate in a decade, with over 561,000 jobs created since we came to office—an impressive record for a new government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know families in my electorate of Corangamite and across the country are being hit hard by the cost of living. Therefore, the Albanese government's No. 1 priority remains addressing this inflation and cost-of-living challenge. We have targeted a comprehensive $23 billion plan to help address the pressures in the economy. This includes cheaper medicines, fee-free TAFE, electricity bill relief, the boosting of income support payments, cheaper childcare, increased rent assistance, more Medicare bulk-billing, the expansion of paid parental leave, the boosting of income support payments and more affordable homes being built.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of this, we've successfully advocated for wage increases for minimum and award-wage workers, and we're funding pay rises for aged-care workers. Recent results show the unemployment rate remained around historic lows, at 3.6 per cent, and the participation rate was 66.7 per cent, near the record high recorded recently.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we welcome these results, we are realistic about the challenges ahead. While our labour force remains resilient, high interest rates, high but moderating inflation and growing uncertainty in the global economy are still having an impact on our economy. Rate rises are clearly biting hard, consumption is slowing, retail turnover is soft, and households and businesses are feeling that pressure. That is why our primary focus is on the cost of living, doing all we can to reduce its impact while also laying the foundations for a stronger economy, and building a more dynamic and inclusive labour market.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:00</span>):  Last Thursday, I met with some good-hearted people, people who are concerned about the aged-care sector: Jeff Hay and Fran Hatty from the Tocumwal Lions Community Hostel. They're not in my electorate but in the neighbouring electorate of Farrer. Also there were John Knight and Ross Tout from Uralba at Gundagai. They are very concerned about what is happening in aged care, particularly around the 24/7 registered nursing model. This private member's motion talks about funding a wage rise for aged-care workers. There's not much point in giving aged-care workers a wage rise if there is not an aged-care facility there. Indeed, Ms Hatty has said to me: 'Let's hope we can keep these little places going. In my opinion, they are the perfect place for our local people needing extra care as they age.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The situation we have in country centres at the moment is that, if Labor continues to push ahead with 24/7 RNs, what you're going to see is many of those country aged-care facilities close because they can't meet that demand. In a facility such as Junee, where there are 19 or so residents, that means they probably need four or five RNs. They're very difficult to find in a community of that size, let alone a community of 70,000 people, such as Wagga Wagga.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is about jobs. As the member for Groom pointed out, real wages have gone down under Labor. It's a simple fact. Don't take just the member for Groom's word and my word for it. ABC Fact Check has clearly stated that wages are under pressure because of the policies brought about by the government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud of our record in government. For nine years, we put small business, workers and those people who help run the economy first and foremost. I look at my own electorate and the Inland Rail project, for instance. Now, 4,600 people worked on the Inland Rail project when we were in government. We were only just starting the Parkes to Narromine section—the first section—and then working on Narromine to Narrabri and Beveridge to Albury. All these sections gave hope and opportunity, particularly for Aboriginal people. For some, it was their first job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What has happened to infrastructure since Labor came to power? They've put a pause on it. Just prior to the 2023 budget, the infrastructure minister said she was going to review all the infrastructure projects over a 90-day period. Some might say, 'Yes, okay,' but that's now 200 days plus! When is that review going to come out, and what is it going to entail? At the moment, what we're seeing with the review is that people are leaving Inland Rail and road projects in droves because councils, states and everybody else just doesn't know.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This side has the audacity to come in here and start talking about jobs, lecturing us about how bad we were when we were in government. Well, I'm quite frankly sick to the back teeth of listening to the Labor dirt unit talking about how bad we were when we were in government. As a government, we stopped the boats. We put in place measures which actually protected lives, because so many people were dying at sea. We put in measures to fix up the mess that Labor had left, and yet then they turn around on this false notion that somehow, some way, we were a bad government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, out there, the media might be conned—some of them—but the people aren't. Those people running businesses know that they no longer have an unlimited instant asset write-off. They know that it's capped and they know that it's capped because of the policies brought in by the Labor government. They know that inflation is at record highs, and indeed we only had to look last Tuesday, the first Tuesday in November, to see that, again, the rates that stopped a nation went up. And home mortgages—it is so hard to find a house, to find affordability in the housing market. And what is that side doing? They're talking about everything but what Mr and Mrs Average out there are talking about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;">
                  </span>So I say: get out to your electorate, start listening to people—not talking at them like you normally do—get yourselves in operation, get yourselves in line with what normal everyday people are thinking— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I draw attention to a core role of government: spending taxpayer money. I'm talking about everything from small community grant programs of a few thousand dollars to investment funds worth billions. This money can help small volunteer groups like food shares, footy clubs and first-aid trainers. It can help them to upgrade their facilities and equipment, or it could go to larger, much-needed projects like building new homes for low-income families. But, too often, where the money goes is decided not on where the need is most but on where the votes are most valuable. I'm talking about sports rorts, car park rorts and hospital rorts; I'm talking about pork barrelling. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the previous government's commuter car park program, 75 per cent of the projects announced were in coalition seats—with no competitive process. In its assessment of the program, the Audit Office found the approach to identifying and selecting projects was 'not designed to be open or transparent'. Projects were not selected on merit. This means the Audit Office found it's not about the evidence; it's about the polling. It's about marginal seats and about who has access to a minister. Under the community sport infrastructure program—otherwise known as sports rorts—decisions were not made based on the recommendations from the department, where projects were rated against assessment criteria. Instead, it was the infamous colour coded spreadsheet that showed which electorate each project was in and the margin by which it was held.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, while these examples are some of the most egregious, we know that making funding decisions based on marginal seats is not a practice confined to the coalition. The first round of the Mobile Black Spot Program delivered under this government was only open by invitation—and only to electorates that had been promised new towers during last year's election campaign. Again, three-quarters of the towers were in Labor seats, and in New South Wales that's 100 per cent. This matter is already under investigation by the Audit Office, after a referral from the shadow minister for communications—a referral which I support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As taxpayers, is it too much to hope that our taxes are spent in the public interest and based on evidence, on a cost-benefit analysis or on where the need is greatest? No. But, too often, funding goes where the need for votes is greatest. It's not fair, it's not right. It's terrible governance, and voters agree with me. A poll released only last month by the Australia Institute found that 81 per cent of those surveyed considered it corrupt conduct to allocate public money to projects in marginal seats in order to win votes. I want to do something about it. In June, the Joint Standing Committee on Public Accounts and Audit report into the administration of government grants made six recommendations for reform—but they did not go anywhere near far enough. The recommendations do not guarantee that this behaviour change will change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, I'm calling on the government to introduce legislation to ensure public money is not misused and is not wasted. This legislation must set out clear requirements to publish Commonwealth grant guidelines. It sounds so obvious, but even this bare minimum is not already legislated. Any reform must include legislated, robust, mandatory and timely public reporting requirements about grants programs. If a minister makes a decision to give money against departmental advice, they should have to stand up in this place and tell us why. We need parliamentary oversight locked in with legislation. These decisions shouldn't be allowed to fly under the radar. We shouldn't have to wait for an audit report or a media investigation to uncover pork-barrelling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now this is not about removing ministerial discretion; it's about legislated transparency and accountability when that discretion is used, and new laws must provide a framework for parliamentary oversight of grants by setting up a joint committee on grants administration. This is my message to the government: get on and make this law. I'd love to work with you on it, but, if you don't choose to do that, I'll get on and do it anyway. I've done it before and succeeded when I fought hard alongside people from across the political spectrum—alongside people like the member for Bass—to establish a robust national anticorruption commission and bring it to life. This is important, this is urgent and the Australian public demand this of us because, before we know it, we will be back in election season—prime-time pork season. How politicians spend taxpayer money must be reformed if we are to restore trust in politics.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:11</span>):  I thank the member for Indi for bringing this motion before the chamber. The member has been an advocate for integrity in our political system since she first entered the parliament, and I was very pleased to work with the member on the Joint Select Committee on National Anti-Corruption Commission Legislation. We can, as a parliament, be proud that the NACC now exists.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I, too, acknowledge the good that can flow from the application of Commonwealth grants for our community and sporting groups, businesses, local governments and not-for-profits. In Hasluck, as I stand here speaking on this, there are a number of very worthy groups waiting patiently to hear whether they've been successful in their applications for the community volunteer grants. Grants should be allocated both fairly and transparently. It is certainly correct that this did not apply to all the grant allocations under the previous coalition government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over a year ago now, the National Audit Office reported on the coalition's Building Better Regions Fund and found evidence of significant rorting. It was a $1.15 billion fund, and Australians who simply had the wrong postcode had a much smaller chance of succeeding in an application. Liberal and National held seats were unfairly favoured. Then there was the commuter car park program, which was the subject of a scathing assessment by the National Audit Office, which found that the infrastructure department had selected exactly none of the 47 sites and described the coalition's process as a non-competitive, non-application based process that was not demonstrably merit based. Not only were many of the car parks not needed but some of them were going to be built on land already earmarked for other purposes. In the now electorate of my friend the member for Macnamara, the land was already allocated for public housing, which demonstrates not only the coalition's poor planning and pork-barrelling but also their lack of commitment to public housing, which was further demonstrated by their failure to vote for the Housing Australia Future Fund. The voting public should be reminded of this chicanery by the coalition on a regular basis. It wasn't $660 million from the sky; it was hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars being sprayed up against the wall of a car park.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Likewise, the coalition's community sport infrastructure grants were simply an attempt to bolster the chances of the Liberals and Nationals hanging on to marginal seats. The member for Cook's webpage still encourages people to apply for this grant today. In June this year, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit found that the coalition's grant processes across a number of schemes involved unjustifiably partisan outcomes, with ministers' decisions simply not recorded, inadequate or unavailable. Until we have seen a wholesale turnover of coalition members, we shall keep reminding voters that the member for Cook, the member for Dickson, Senator McKenzie and others were responsible for this serial travesty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is unfortunate that the member for Indi refers to the Albanese government's community battery program alongside these other programs in this motion. In addition to the fact that it's an excellent pledge made from opposition and in addition to the fact that the initial distribution of the 50 batteries appears to be very even, the member for Indi knows that all prospective applicants for the hundreds of community batteries still to be rolled out will be dealt with at arm's length by ARENA, which is, as far as I can tell, exactly what the member for Indi wants. So too is the government's Growing Regions Program, the guidelines for which were announced in May this year, evidence of the government's commitment to fairness and transparency. The guidelines include the introduction of a multiparty parliamentary panel—the panel will recommend only projects that meet regional priorities—and an external probity adviser, who will provide advice to the multiparty parliamentary panel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Back home in Hasluck, I've created a local grants committee of people independent of me and my party to make recommendations for community grants. A few of the grant recipients have included: the Perth Observatory Volunteer Group, who run out of the Perth Observatory in Bickley and have received funding for first-aid training and a defibrillator; the Parkerville Playgroup, who have received funding for their play equipment, shade sails, benches and a range of equipment to help them maintain their gorgeous building and excellent services, and I look forward to seeing them on Friday; and Trillion Trees in Hazelmere, who have received funding for misting fans to support their volunteers taking care of their nursery of plants in Perth's hot summer weather. Trillion Trees plants native trees all over Hasluck and Perth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Integrity is basic to the work we do here. I thank the member for Indi for raising this important matter, and I commend the work done by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, chaired by my friend the member for Bruce. I'm aware that the government is considering the recommendations of that committee's report and I look forward to being part of the parliament to see it implemented in due course.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ARCHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:16</span>):  As the federal member for Bass, I've seen several grant programs support a number of critical projects. As the member for Indi acknowledged, Commonwealth grants are vitally important to the positive and meaningful work carried out by community organisations, local governments, businesses and not-for-profits, particularly in regional and rural areas. However, our communities, who are vying for necessary funding, must have faith in the procedures and nobody wants to see any grant program misused. Whether an application is successful or not, there needs to be a level of trust in how the decision was made and the transparency of process should be at the centre of grant funding going forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue of ministerial discretion is a great place to start. No matter the government of the day, it's difficult to build a level of trust with the public, particularly if a minister has the ability to override a decision made by the Public Service without needing to explain to the public why this decision was made. I note the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit recently tabled its findings after an inquiry into grants programs. The eight recommendations handed down by the committee include: clarifying the definition of an election commitment for the purpose of delivering grants; that competitive merit based processes be adopted by default and that decision-makers be forced to document reasons why any are not; and that the Australian National Audit Office audits the manner in which the finance minister is told of grant approvals which don't match agency recommendations. These recommendations should be supported, and I fully support all of those recommendations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, though, the member for Indi's call to introduce legislation to reform grants administration to ensure public money is not misused also has merit and should have the support of elected representatives that walk these halls. Asking for clear requirements for published Commonwealth grant guidelines and selection criteria; robust and public reporting requirements about how grant programs are administered, including grants that are awarded contrary to departmental advice; and a framework for a parliamentary joint committee on grants administration to improve grants oversight are all reasonable measures and shouldn't be feared by any elected representative.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2018, a joint study from Griffith University and Transparency International Australia found that 85 per cent of Australians think at least some federal politicians are corrupt, while 56 per cent had personally witnessed or suspected public officials of making decisions that favoured a business or individual who gave them political donations or support. It's interesting to note that the number was higher amongst those who had worked in government, 61 per cent, and even higher among those who had worked in federal government, 67 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms and proposed legislation are a solid building block towards restoring trust and integrity in how grants are administered and shouldn't leave MPs or senators concerned. A more transparent process is a win-win situation for our electorates and their representatives. A clear and defined process would also avoid unnecessary delays in commitments made, which often lead to increased infrastructure costs or the loss of a project altogether. In my seat of Bass, $500,000 in funding for the local tennis centre was awarded through the community sports infrastructure grants program prior to me becoming a candidate at the 2019 election. This grant was to update incredibly out-of-date facilities, many of which were utilised for the Launceston Tennis International tournament, which, for some years, saw up-and-coming tennis champions having to use shipping containers to get changed. While the review of the program was necessary, and while the grant was found to be above board, the lengthy delay led to a cost blowout within the project. To date, that project has been unable to proceed, and, sadly, our region has now lost this prestigious tournament to the North West.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, in March 2022, I was proud to announce two projects of substantial merit—the safe harbour project on Flinders Island and the redevelopment of the Exeter recreation hub—as part of the March budget. These two projects were of much significance for the local communities, but, with the change of government, the federal government placed the projects under review. Whilst I don't have any issue with the review process, the length of time the review took placed an unnecessary burden on the project proponents. It took a little under 18 months for both projects to finally get the tick-off and for funds to proceed, again causing budget blowouts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand the need to ensure these projects are awarded through due process. If considerable reform was undertaken in how grants are administered, that would avoid this issue, and I'm all for that. As somebody who has actively advocated for action to be taken to rebuild the trust the Australian public have in their elected officials, I believe this reform is another necessary step towards achieving this goal.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282212" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms THWAITES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:21</span>):  I would like to thank the member for Indi for this motion. I do know that issues of integrity are important to her and are something that she has been working on throughout her time here. I know they're important to her community, as they are to my community, and I know how pleased we both are that this country now has the National Anti-Corruption Commission in operation, delivered as one of the highest priorities when our government came into office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, our government's commitment to integrity extends beyond the National Anti-Corruption Commission. There is an important place for grants in our communities, providing funding opportunities that help make a difference on a large or small scale. Every year billions of dollars in federal grants are provided across the country, and we've all seen the benefits that these grants can bring. They are broad ranging, including research; the delivery of health, community and legal services; infrastructure funding; and building capacity in our communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In determining and delivering these grants, our government wants to strengthen the integrity, accountability and transparency of that process, because that matters as well as outcomes. It is important to highlight how this is a different approach to that taken by the former government. Under the Morrison government, we saw sports rorts, the Building Better Regions Fund, the Urban Congestion Fund and the Safer Communities Fund. These are just a few examples of the former government's lack of process in how they used taxpayer funds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sports rorts is one that particularly frustrated my community. In one memorable case, a club in my community of Jagajaga, the Greensborough Hockey Club, missed out on a grant through this program, even though their application had been deemed deserving of support. It wasn't the quality of their application that wasn't getting there it wasn't the assessment that they were deserving of support—it was clearly rejected for other reasons. At the time, the club said to me that they would've understood if they had missed out for other worthy funding applications, but it was a shock for them to be overlooked for other applications that weren't deemed highly suitable or highly regarded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, of course, we had the Building Better Regions Fund. A report conducted by the ANAO found that, in over five rounds of funding, the former government didn't get better at administering these grants; in fact, it got worse. Towards the end of that time, the approach of the Liberals and the Nationals resulted in more than 65 per cent of the grants that were funded not being in line with departmental recommendations, without justification.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Minister Catherine King, herself a regional MP, has said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">…if the target is that you want to help, lift up regional Australia, lift up every region … this did not do that. It lifted up some regions at the expense of others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Safer Communities Fund, a program administered by the now Leader of the Opposition, aimed to address crime and antisocial behaviour by funding crime prevention activities. What the Audit Office found, though, was that, in situations where there was full and part-funding of projects, the full recommended funding was more likely to be awarded to applications in coalition seats, while partial funding was more likely to be awarded for applications in Labor seats.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The community can see the patterns in this type of behaviour. These programs and this behaviour shake the trust that people should have in the way that this institution runs and in the way that grants are applied. That is important. It should be important to all of us in here that people have trust in our politics and they have trust in work of government. So I am pleased to say that our government is taking a different approach, and that's why the Minister for Finance has asked her department to develop options that enhance the integrity, the accountability and the transparency of the Commonwealth grant rules and guidelines, to update these rules and guidelines that underpin the policy framework that federal government grants operate under. In doing that work the issues being considered are wide-ranging, but they do reflect the government's commitment to integrity in these matters because integrity is at the heart of how we should be approaching these problems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to highlight the work of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, which earlier this year held an inquiry into grants administration. The tabling of their report includes the line:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the previous government pursued industrial scale rorting for blatantly partisan purposes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The chair of that committee, the member for Bruce, made a really important point with regard to ministers accepting or rejecting departmental advice:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Ministers are not 'gods' and are subject to the law and the rules and must record properly and fully documented reasons.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ministers are accountable to the public for their decisions and they should have a transparent process around that so it is clear how they go about making those decisions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government will not follow the previous example set by those opposite. We do want integrity around government grants, and I thank the member for the motion.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr NEUMANN:</span>
                  </a>  As a lawyer like me she's passionate about this issue and knows that community legal centres assist thousands of Australians who could not otherwise have access to legal assistance. Community legal centres ensure that all Australians are able to have their rights upheld. They serve to rebalance the weights of justice into equilibrium, going some way towards levelling the playing field for those who need help. The most vulnerable members of our community rely on community legal centres. I know many of my constituents rely on the services of centres like TASC Legal and Social Justice Service in Ipswich, for example.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government acknowledge that the work done by CLCs is very important. It's fundamental to who we are as a nation. When Labor were last in government, we injected almost half a billion dollars into the legal assistance sector. In our last government budget in 2013 we continued the long haul of repairing and rebuilding this sector by providing an extra $52.3 million for legal aid, community legal centres and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal services. I know this personally because I can remember, as Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General, letting people know of the extra funding and how pleased and appreciative they were.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the first moves of the Abbott coalition government was to strip all that back, and then those opposite carried on with that form for a decade. I remember the Taylor Street Community Legal Service centre up there in Hervey Bay losing funding, and that's just one example of a number around the country that lost funding because the Abbott coalition government immediately stripped away funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, the sector has suffered from neglect, funding cuts and occasional outright hostility from the coalition government of the past decade. It was often dragged into a wider culture war waged by the Liberal Party's hard Right. Lawyers who provided critical assistance to vulnerable people were branded un-Australia by senior members of the former government. Successive coalition Attorneys-General did nothing to defend the legal assistance profession against those attacks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before entering parliament, I was an accredited specialist in family law and practised law for nearly 25 years across a range of areas. As a lawyer, I witnessed the damaging impact of coercive control and other forms of domestic violence on women, in particular, and on their children. I know how crucial community legal centres are for giving women and children access to justice that they otherwise wouldn't have. Recently, the Albanese Labor government made significant changes to family law to make it simpler and safer for separated families and their children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to note these reforms, and the backing of the community legal centres, as well as other key stakeholders. I know some government members have been reaching out to their local community legal centres to raise awareness of the changes. We know that community legal centres are best placed to understand and advocate for changes to unfair systems that impact their clients. On that front, the royal commission into the robodebt scheme recommended that when it next conducts a review of the national legal assistance partnership the Commonwealth should have regard, when considering funding for legal aid commissions and community legal centres, for the importance of the public interest role played by these services, as exemplified by their work during the scheme.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The robodebt royal commission indeed acknowledged the significant role legal assistance providers played in advocating for systemic change and for the discontinuation of that unlawful and shameful scheme. To that end, it's worth noting that in June the government initiated an independent review of the National Legal Assistance Partnership. The current NLAP is a $2.4 billion agreement between Commonwealth, state and territory governments to provide legal assistance services to the most vulnerable people in Australia, including community legal service centres. The current NLAP is due to expire in 2025, and this independent and transparent review will consider how future funding arrangements can best provide access to justice for those who need it. The terms of reference have been agreed on by all jurisdictions in consultation with representatives from legal assistance. It is due to be completed by early 2024, and its findings will inform governments regarding future funding arrangements. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SHARKIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:31</span>):  Community legal services are a cornerstone for accessing justice. They matter because your bank balance should not determine whether you can secure desperately needed support with respect to legal challenges. Every week, I have constituents contacting me, normally highly distressed and overwhelmed by the legal system, struggling to navigate it and seeking assistance—and I'm sure you experience the same thing, Deputy Speaker Archer. Those issues can be related to family matters, domestic and family violence, and consumer protections. As members of parliament, we can't provide any legal advice, but what we can do is direct our constituents to community legal centres and their amazing teams.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Community legal centres are based in local communities, they focus on clients and they work across a spectrum of areas—family law, credit, debt, consumer law, family violence, housing, elder abuse and elder law—which is an area that is desperately needing more support, particularly for older people who perhaps have a bereavement with respect to their partner, at which things can get very messy with other people in the family—employment, and social security support. In Mayo, the Southern Community Justice Centre take on general legal, civil, criminal and family matters. They have a vast reach, from Christies Beach down to Mount Gambier and the Riverland, the south coast and Kangaroo Island—the area is enormous, and it must be overwhelming for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The summary of Community Legal Centres Australia's response to the 2023-24 federal budget recognises that the government has committed funding to some important initiatives to support people with financial hardships, but expresses disappointment that few resources were put towards improving access to justice and interventions. This is an area where a dollar spent in the community legal centre space provides tenfold support for the community. The more people we can get out of the courts, whom we can support with remedies without going through what is a very stressful and a very costly experience, the better. The member for Dunkley has moved that the government be acknowledged for commencing an independent review into the National Legal Assistance Partnership—known as 'the agreement'—which is the main funding framework for the sector. We know that this agreement is set to expire in June 2025, so commencing a review now does seem a very timely and sensible thing to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I am concerned, when I look at the figures, that community legal centres turned away an estimated 170,000 people in 2016 due to a lack of capacity. That was seven years ago. We know that these services are oversubscribed and that many people who desperately need support are not able to access support. I urge the government to factor indexation into all funding agreements going forward to manage high inflation. I also suggest peak bodies, such as Community Legal Centres Australia, be funded to provide support for centres. I'd also like to see measures to level the field and remove the postcode lottery for regional and rural Australians to access community legal services. They really are few and far between. When you get out into the regions, it's very difficult for people to access support, particularly when you've got to factor in that we don't have the public transport so that people can necessarily get into Christies Beach or even down to Mount Gambier. It makes it very challenging. I guess it's like health and a range of other policy areas, where, if you live in the regions, you are generally far worse off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important that we recognise the value of our community legal centres. I would like to do a shout-out to all of the people who are working today in community legal centres right across Australia: thank you for the good work you do. I know that many of our constituents have been forwarded on. We advocate for more support, but it's critically important that we recognise the great work that people do. I sometimes think they're a social worker and a lawyer rolled into one. Thank you, community legal services.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:36</span>):  I'm proud to rise to speak on the motion put forward by the member for Dunkley, the representative in this House with the biggest heart. We know that community legal centres are based on the notion of social inclusion and access to justice for all. Community legal centres are independent not-for-profit organisations that provide a wide range of general and specialist legal services. They have a significant impact across communities by providing appropriate and effective client services; increased knowledge of, and access to, services that meet the community's legal needs; support to the justice system to effectively operate and make policy and practice decisions; and meaningful professional experience to volunteers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to highlight the nearly 200 community legal centres right across Australia. They're all dedicated to offering legal help to the most vulnerable among us. I particularly want to highlight the Women's Legal Service Queensland that operates in my electorate in Annerley but also give a special call-out to the Inala legal service that services my electorate but is actually in the electorate next door. The Women's Legal Service Queensland provides legal assistance and other key support services to women in the areas of domestic and family violence, family law—something that I know you care passionately about, Deputy Speaker—child protection and sexual assault. They do that right across Queensland. They're well known and well respected across Australia for their work protecting women and children, and their policy advocacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ensuring access to justice and equality before the law is paramount, particularly for those that are disadvantaged. Many of my constituents depend on these centres' services, reinforcing their fundamental role in our community. These centres are not just a resource; they're a beacon of hope for fair representation and support in navigating the complex legal system. I acknowledge and support the vital work that they do. I should point out that they also speed up courts, as self-represented litigants take longer to be dealt with by magistrates and judges. This motion recognises the vital role played by CLCs in Australia. CLCs serve as pillars of support for individuals and families navigating legal matters, offering essential guidance and assistance. Community legal centres, from Queensland to Victoria, also contribute to equal access to justice, particularly for vulnerable and marginalised communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must also be aware of the public interest role played by the provision of these legal services. They provide free legal help to hundreds of thousands of people, with a special emphasis on the vulnerable and disadvantaged members of the community. The work of CLCs is critical in contributing to social inclusion. They're often the first point of contact for people seeking assistance, or their last resort when all else has failed. Without the work of community legal centres, many of the legal issues facing marginalised communities would be unmet and unaddressed. We acknowledge the hard work of CLCs who often bear the brunt of increased pressures and workloads, as they pick up cases unable to be dealt with by other organisations. Without the tireless dedication and commitment of staff and volunteers, CLCs wouldn't be able to provide their invaluable services, and they're often in the tougher end of law, such as in aged care, with homeless people and with people with mental health issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another important function of CLCs is to provide information to the community about their rights and responsibilities. I'm reminding people that, despite what politicians say, there is a presumption of innocence in common law countries. You must be found guilty by the state; you start with that presumption of innocence—not that you'd see that when you hear some politicians talk. Through community legal education, CLCs play another vital role in supporting the legal needs of vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals and communities. In this sense, CLCs service an early intervention and prevention strategy by providing legal education and working with government and other bodies to improve unfair laws. Community legal education activities ensure that communities have improved access to legal information and education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Relationships with community partners are critical to bridging the gap and opening dialogue. CLCs play a crucial role in informing decision-makers about how law and policy affect the community and contribute to making laws and practice fairer. That's why I particularly wanted to mention the Women's Legal Service in my electorate. For the woman who's escaped a violent partner and can move on with her life safely, the older person who's been helped to address the abuse from a relative, the person who is rehoused after being unfairly evicted and the young person who's assisted to address the mounting debt through unpaid fines—all of these people would agree that community legal centres change lives. They not only improve access to justice but are best placed to understand injustice when it arises, and, importantly, they advocate for change. They are to be commended.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249224" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms RYAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:41</span>):  It is my pleasure to join colleagues this morning to speak about the community legal centres. I want to thank the member for Dunkley for bringing forward this motion today because community legal centres across Australia do pivotal work in our communities. In the motion, I want to draw attention to the view and the quote from the Royal Commission into the Robodebt Scheme:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… When it next conducts a review of the National Legal Assistance Partnership, the Commonwealth should have regard, in considering funding for legal aid commissions and community legal centres, to the importance of the public interest role played by those services as exemplified in their work during the Scheme… </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to echo the sentiments of the royal commission because the critical point and the hard places that the Royal Commission into the Robodebt Scheme shone a light on were often brought to our attention in our electorates by those community legal centres. That was certainly one of the groups that I was talking to very early in the piece when first becoming aware that we had the issue of people being incorrectly issued with a debt notice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">WEstjustice is the community legal centre, and it was first founded as the Footscray Legal Centre many decades ago. WEstjustice operates across the western suburbs of Melbourne and has a home in the electorate of Lalor, in its Werribee office. It has done absolutely incredible work in my 10 years in the parliament, advising the now government, when we were in opposition, around name-change issues for refugees, particularly, in my community for those from Myanmar, and the complications of their immigration documents when a name was used but didn't translate into our Anglo-Saxon world. That often meant many years of delays in citizenship processes, which were easily overcome once a few lawyers put their head in there, sorted it out and gave us advice, which I believe was passed to the government, and we managed to get those things fixed fairly quickly. That's one of their roles and the role that I find most valuable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously we've just heard from the member for Moreton, who talked at length about the cases that community legal centres may do individually to support people. But, for me, the power of their work is in aggregating that information and bringing it to us as MPs and representatives in this place to alert us to trends or things that are obvious when you're on the grand. You aggregate the data of the individual cases and say: 'We have a problem with the name changes for refugees in this country.' We had a problem, highlighted by West Justice, around young people from New Zealand families, which was highlighted nationally and internationally, where we found young people from New Zealand backgrounds in my electorate and electorates like mine who may have left an unhappy family situation and were caught with no support from the Commonwealth. We found young people involved in illegal activity so that they could feed themselves or find somewhere to sleep or young people couch surfing because they weren't entitled to the supports that other young Australian people were entitled to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the advocacy work in that space became something that was taken up. In government we are now looking at: the citizenship processes for New Zealand families, which would alleviate those young people of those things; tenancy advice around, if you can't pay your bills, which bills you should pay first to ensure that you don't lose the roof over your head; legal centres that are setting up those advice clinics in local areas; and the hospital presence, which was first piloted by West Justice with Mercy Health, in my electorate, where they were on the ground and could see, particularly, women at their most vulnerable and give them legal advice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">West Justice is also renowned in my community for introducing the lawyers and schools program across Melbourne's west, where lawyers actually attend the school and give advice to families and students. It has been game changing in my electorate.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm a proud supporter of the commercial fishing industry right across Australia but particularly in my electorate of Gippsland. We have a world-class environmental and sustainable fishery based in my electorate of Gippsland. I'll concentrate my comments today on Lakes Entrance, but this does have broader implications when it comes to considering national food security and our trade imbalance when it comes to seafood products.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It should be bleedingly obvious in the terms of the motion before the House today, and you would assume that everyone in Australia would understand, how important commercial fishing is on a social, economic, environmental and cultural basis. But what I'm finding more and more is that there is a disconnect between our rural and regional communities and our metropolitan communities when it comes to understanding the work we do in rural and regional Australia to provide the food and fibre for this nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion deliberately refers to social impacts, economic impacts, environmental impacts and cultural impacts of the commercial fixing sector, because I think it's important to note that white fellas have culture as well. We quite rightly respect and recognise the thousands of years of Indigenous culture in this country—and we're getting better at doing that every day in my electorate—but white fellas have culture too. When it comes to the commercial fishing industry, there are multiple generations of more recent arrivals in my electorate, the European settlers to the region, who have been involved in the commercial fishing sector. They've passed on their skills, knowledge and culture to extended members of their own families. That generational culture is at risk of being taken away because of the way we approach the commercial fishing industry in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are under pressure in the commercial fishing sector in Lakes Entrance from: bureaucracy; an incredible amount of red tape; changing environmental laws, which change almost on an annual basis for our fishermen; the oil and gas fields, which have taken away some of the fishing grounds; and, more recently, offshore wind proposals. I wrote to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy in a joint letter with my state member in relation to the potential impact of the proposed wind farms on the commercial fishing zones. The special squeeze on the fishing grounds is undermining the viability of our commercial fishing sector, and it's something the minister must take into account when he weighs up how to apply the offshore wind zones and how they will interact with the commercial fishing sector and their generational importance to my community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm concerned that not enough people in this building understand that there are two choices when it comes to something like the commercial fishing industry—when it comes to seafood. You either grow and use your own seafood in a sustainable way or you use someone else's. In many cases in Australia, when you're using someone else's, it's being imported from countries with less sustainable environmental practices, and, in my community, we feel that we are under siege. We feel that our lifestyles and our livelihoods are under siege because of decisions being made in Melbourne and in Canberra, which directly impact some of the lifestyles and economic generators in our region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I could change the words from 'commercial fishing' in this motion to, say, 'native timber' or 'intensive agriculture', and the motion would read almost exactly the same, because those industries are also under threat from decision-makers who simply don't understand how these industries work in our community. You either use your own in an environmentally sustainable way or use someone else's. Quite often those other countries have lower environmental protocols than what we have ourselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is—and I talked about this briefly in my opening comments—a huge divide and a disconnect in this country right now between people who grow our food and fibre and those who consume most of it in our metropolitan areas. We have to get better at sharing information and building the social licence for these critically important industries to continue to exist. The commercial fishing industry is just one of those industries that is under siege, under threat, in my electorate of Gippsland. Quite simply—and I say this with no disrespect to people in metropolitan areas—we've had a complete gutful of being told what jobs we can and can't have in regional areas from people who live in cities and have no intention of ever living in our communities. We have had a complete gutful of being told what jobs we can and can't have by people who don't even want to live with us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the commercial fishing industry, the purpose of the motion today is to raise awareness of our commercial fishing industry, to raise awareness of the social, economic, environmental and cultural importance of that industry and to urge the decision-makers and the minister to show some respect to the families involved in those industries when they're making their decisions. Their decisions affect people on the ground and at sea in rural and regional Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265970" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOSH WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:52</span>):  I'm glad to speak to the motion about the importance of Australia's fisheries. I thank the member for Gippsland for bringing it forward. I represent a proud fishing community, a proud metro fishing community. A few weeks ago, I marched as part of the Blessing of the Fleet procession through Fremantle. It's one of the most important occasions on our annual calendar, an expression of our character and history. Of course, it's purpose is to pray for a safe and bountiful fishing season. There are two annual marches in Fremantle each year: the May Day march and the Blessing of the Fleet. Both have at their core the wellbeing of working people. The fact that the streets of Freo are consistently filled with community support on these occasions is testament to the deep commitment we have not only to the health and safety of all workers but especially to those who undertake inherently dangerous occupations, which is the case right across our maritime workforce. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my community and throughout Western Australia, there's a strong value placed on our fishing industry not only for its economic value and diversity but also because it represents a form of maritime activity that has sustainability as one of its essential conditions. Like farmers, fishers know that, if you don't exist in harmony with the natural environment, there is no stability and no future beyond the medium term. In 2000, the West Coast Rock Lobster Fishery was the first in the world to be certified by the Marine Stewardship Council, and in 2022 it was recertified for a record fifth time. It is Australia's most valuable single-species wild catch fishery, involving more than 200 vessels and employing nearly 2,000 people. In 2019, the WA octopus and sea cucumber fisheries received MSC certification, and, now with 10 certified fisheries, Western Australia leads the nation when it comes to sustainable seafood industries. We should acknowledge and celebrate these important achievements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The sustainability of fisheries is first and foremost a matter of environmental stewardship. It is our obligation to protect environmental conditions and biodiversity. Those things should be protected for their intrinsic importance, separate from our interest in them. But, of course, sustainability is critical to our wellbeing too because environmental degradation and overfishing will inevitably mean the end of fishing. On that front, the coalition should have the courage to undertake some self-reflection. They have consistently opposed measures like Labor's world-leading national network of marine protected areas. They have consistently worked to cut back and weaken those protections, just as they have turned a blind eye to the serious harm caused by the industrial-scale marine brutality of super trawlers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The week before last, I was fortunate to visit the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California. One of the result of their scientific work, matching the evidence we've collected here in Australia, is that marine sanctuaries help protect biodiversity and they result in healthier and more productive fisheries. We acted on that science in government, just as we are delivering a new Futures of Seafood project to ensure that fisheries and aquaculture in Australia can plan to thrive in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government have already taken a number of key actions to protect the health of Australia's sustainable fisheries. For example, the Minister for the Environment and Water has tripled the size of the Macquarie Island Marine Park. We have increased funding for the Australian Institute of Marine Science. We have made sure that Australia is active in supporting international efforts like the 30 by 30 initiative that will ensure 30 per cent of the world's oceans are protected by 2030 while, at the same time, we seek to advance a treaty to protect the high seas and show leadership through Australia's membership to the High Ambition Coalition to End Plastic Pollution addressing the scourge of ocean plastic. What's more, we have a process in train to look at how Australia can address illegal, unreported and unregulated fisheries which endanger workers and damage global fish stocks and biodiversity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Gippsland intimated, about 65 per cent of the seafood consumed in Australia is imported, and yet we have a seriously ineffective and opaque framework when it comes to preventing the importation of products from IUU fisheries in our region. While both the US and the EU have IUU protections, I was glad, in my former role in opposition, to include consideration of an IUU framework as part of Labor's policy commitment prior to the 2022 election. Now, that work is underway to figure out how we can apply a system that ensures Australian households can be confident that the seafood we consume comes from properly managed, sustainable and safe fisheries. This, of course, also means that Australian sourced seafood is not competing against product that is cheaper simply as a result of being dependent on environmentally harmful and unfair practices, including practices that constitute modern slavery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we care about fisheries and marine biodiversity, we need to keep supporting healthy, sustainable and high-quality industry in Australia while sharing the globally cooperative work to see more of our oceans protected and to identify and eliminate careless, destructive and cruel fishing practices elsewhere. That is precisely what the Albanese Labor government is doing. That has been our focus since we were first elected. That will continue to be our work in support of Australia's sustainable fisheries.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILLCOX</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:57</span>):  I thank the member for Gippsland for moving this important motion to the House. This motion is in response to the disastrous decisions that the Albanese Labor government keeps making about the Australian commercial fishing industry, decisions that are causing catastrophic damage for our fishers and for our communities. The Australian commercial fishing industry is world-class and that's a fact. It is sustainable. It's backed by science. It contributes to our national food security and delivers crucial economic and employment benefits, particularly in regions such as my electorate of Dawson.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've stood before in this very room talking about the dire consequences of the Labor government's irrational decisions, and I'm back here again today because voices are just not getting heard. The voices of so many in North Queensland are just not getting heard. The commercial fishing industry in Australia is highly regulated to ensure sustainable resource management. The industry has more regulations imposed than most. Fishermen and women have to check in every night. They have to have their logbooks up to date and are constantly checked. They are constantly monitored via government GPS tracking systems and operate under a quota system. And still—still!—the Albanese Labor government and the Minister for the Environment and Water want to make it even worse for our hard-working Aussies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year, the Minister for the Environment and Water announced a ban on commercial gillnet fishing in North Queensland, an announcement that was made with no scientific reasoning, without consultation and not even discussed with the individuals and families that will be impacted. We invited the minister to come up to my electorate and face the people who will be impacted, and what do we hear? Crickets. I wrote to the minister asking for details around compensation packages for our local fishers and, again, crickets. So we called for a Senate inquiry into the decision to give our local fishermen and women their chance to be heard, which should be their right, and, again, this was shot down instantly by the Labor-Greens coalition. Our local fishers have been left in the dark.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So far there have been no announcements of when or how the buybacks for their licences are going to happen, leaving them with no information and no idea of how they're going to continue to support their families, and this is right before Christmas. If this issue were negatively impacting our major cities or our urban areas, there is no way that the current government would be making these decisions. This government believes that this decision is only going to impact regional communities, so they aren't even giving us a chance to have our say. Local fishermen in my electorate of Dawson are going to lose close to 70 per cent of their income due to commercial gillnet bans. Imagine if I stood here today and tried to cut the income of everyone in this room by 70 per cent. There'd be an outcry. This is happening at a time of a Labor created cost-of-living crisis, with 12 interest rate hikes in 18 months and an economy with higher rates of inflation than almost every other advanced economy in the world. It's unbelievable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The commercial fishing operations are not the only businesses that will suffer. The chandlery shops, the boat builders and repairers, the fishmongers, the ice makers, your local fish and chip shops and your corner stores are all going to suffer because of this senseless decision. I have something to tell the minister and the Albanese Labor government: you're wrong in thinking that it won't impact anyone outside regional communities. With this decision alone, you're removing 2,000 tonnes of wild caught Australian seafood from the market—2,000 tonnes. This is going to result in more expensive, lesser quality imported seafood for the Australian public. When I walk into my local fish and chip shop in Bowen, I like the fact that the fish is wild caught and fresh from our region and not fish that has had to travel thousands of kilometres and is of lesser quality. I'm calling on the Albanese Labor government to recognise that the commercial fishing industry is an important industry that has social, economic, environmental and cultural benefits. Stop bowing down to environmental activism and start making decisions based on science.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DZY" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:02</span>):  I want to start off with a small story from my electorate. It follows a Greek family who migrated to Australia and today run one of the largest fishing export businesses in the fishing industry in Australia. What began as a small, family run fish and chip shop in Adelaide in the 1950s is now Raptis Seafoods, which has evolved into one of Australia's largest fishing companies. Half a century on, the business is still proudly family run, with a local and international reputation for responsible fishing and the supply of quality seafood products. Only last month, when we had the fishing industries here, I met with Jim Raptis, who is involved in the business and one of the directors. He went through the whole sustainable fishing process that they do and how that sustains the environment. They're operating 19 commercial vessels across many waters, and their activities range from catching to trading, processing, importing and exporting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Raptis Seafoods are pioneers of a sustainable approach to managing our nation's valuable fish stocks. Like many fisheries, they're committed to environmental protection through their responsible fishing practices and they embrace cutting-edge technology. They ensure the continued delivery of high-quality seafood from the ocean to the plate. They've certainly been a household name in South Australia for many years. The future of Australian fisheries relies upon sustainable fishing practices and a healthy ocean, and this government is committed to working with businesses such as Raptis Seafoods and other fishing businesses in the industry because we understand that supporting these industries' growth contributes to improved sustainability. We know the importance of identifying emerging issues that are impacting the fisheries and aquaculture sectors, and this government is committed to engaging with and learning from the businesses in the sector to support the growth and resilience of the fishing and agriculture sectors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is delivering a new Futures of Seafood project led by the government, industry and research partners. This $450,000 investment will paint a clearer picture of the impacts of emerging marine activities and of climate change pressures on fishing and aquaculture through detailed mapping and modelling of industry impacts. The government is aiming to pave the way for the success of the fishing and aquaculture industries by enabling strategic planning for the future. There is strong industry engagement and it will chart a course for Australia's future in seafood, alongside other ocean uses for the coming 10-15 years into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We recognise the challenges faced by fishing businesses and regional economies, and we acknowledge the pressures on commercial fisheries owing to the need to protect marine ecosystems and transition to a net zero carbon economy. If we don't protect those marine ecosystems, there will be no fishing industry left in this country, and this Albanese Labor government is dedicated to collaborating with the states and territories, peak bodies like Seafood Industry Australia, fishing businesses, and industry players to support the growth of Australia's aquaculture and fishing sectors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the heart of these efforts—and this is progress—is communication with the fishing industry. As the federal member for Adelaide, I am committed to actively engaging with constituents such as Raptis Seafoods, in my electorate, and all other fishing industries. Why? Because businesses like Raptis Seafoods possess the knowledge that ensures their success while preserving our world for future generations and for the industry. I heard a member previously talk about going to his local fish shop and wanting to have Australian produce—I think the majority of Australians want to see Australian seafood in their restaurants, their markets and their shops, and that is what we are striving for.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Capricornia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:07</span>):  Summertime in Australia is synonymous with eating fresh seafood, particularly at Christmastime. It's a normal routine for dozens of eager seafood consumers to wait for hours at their local fishmonger for freshly caught seafood. In fact, it's one of the things my family particularly enjoys around Christmastime. The bountiful seafood caught off the Capricornia coast is always appreciated on a warm Queensland day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our country is surrounded by ocean and boasts an amazing supply of fresh fish and crustaceans. With the Australian Bureau of Statistics showing 80 per cent of Australian population living within 50 kilometres of the coast, is it any wonder we consume seafood in the hundreds of tonnes? In the 2020-21 period, Australians consumed an enormous 365,000 tonnes of seafood, equating to almost 14 kilograms for every person. This seafood is all caught in a highly sustainable and environmentally responsible way by hardworking and diligent fishers. The industry in Australia supports 17,000 people with direct employment in the fisheries and aquaculture sectors. The Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics has reported that in the 2020-21 period, of the 17,000 people working in fisheries, 10,000 were employed in the fishing and trapping sector. It is projected that these men and women will contribute an astonishing $3.63 billion towards our economy in the 2022-23 period. Not only are our fishers creating sustainable methods in our waters but their world-class fishing practices have paved the way for other countries to model their fishing practices to ensure continued fish-level sustainability, ongoing employment and economic strength.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our fishers work and live in some of the most unique natural environments on this planet. They are the custodians of this land and water, so I understand the importance of looking after our waterways and oceans not only out of economic interest but also for future generations to enjoy. Fishers fully understand the need to care for the waters which provide for them. The survival of our fish stock underpins their livelihoods and the next generation of fishers, yet this Labor government is playing this industry for fools. Many fishers have been feeding our nation fresh seafood for generations. Now they are being attacked by this government through a series of decisions which are solely based on winning the votes of the inner city. This government is making decisions which will impact not only fishers and their ability to work but also the consumer, by driving up the cost of their Friday night fish and chips. The futures of at least 100 fishing families and their employees are on the line, with part of these changes to include banning the use of gillnets. However, this isn't the only change to impact our fishers. State Labor governments are also adding salt to their wounds by introducing new quotas and bans on catches of a wide range of fish.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What makes the decision by this government to ban gillnets even harder to swallow is the completely inadequate consultation with fishers in the industry. It is incomprehensible that a government could make a policy decision which would impact an industry so greatly and not consult the organisations who are the voice for the fishing sector. Clint Waldon, a third-generation fisher near Marlborough in Central Queensland, said the announcement of a gillnet fishing ban will mean he won't be able to earn a living anymore. Mr Waldon is quoted in the ABC News, stating his business will be 'rendered completely useless' by the gillnet ban. His 80-year-old family business is on the brink of collapse because of Labor's ideological policies. The federal minister for fisheries, however, is missing in action. The minister is claiming these issues do not fall under his portfolio responsibilities and has no intention of becoming involved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Industry experts such as the Queensland Seafood Industry Association have said the bans are unnecessary, with their executive officer stating that if this government had come to the industry and provided key performance indicators, fishers would've been able to easily meet those requirements. Yet this government has forged ahead with an agenda to appease their inner-city voters. But those living in these cities will be forced to eat seafood imported from other countries, rather than enjoy locally caught seafood, which leaves me incredulous, as our oceans are teeming with seafood. In the past year with Labor at the wheel, Australians have seen their everyday expenses on the rise. The cost of their grocery bills is up by 8.2 per cent in just 12 months. The decision to place a gillnet ban and other quota restrictions will drive up the price of fish for consumers, adding to the pain on the hip pockets of Australians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:12</span>):  My electorate of Gilmore on the New South Wales South Coast has vibrant commercial and recreational fishing industries, and I certainly value the contribution they make to our community. Sustainability is something that many who work in these industries understand, because without sustainable practices there are no fishing industries. For example, we know that in the South East Trawl Fishery we've seen six non-target fish stocks reduced below sustainable levels, so the Australian Fisheries Management Authority has announced catch limits and some fishing ground closures. But the Albanese government hasn't left these commercial fishers to deal with this on their own. We have announced a $24 million voluntary structural adjustment package for those who want to restructure their operations. These changes will actually deliver a more certain future for those fishing operators who remain active, and our package also supports them with $3 million for levy relief to reduce costs while those fishers transition to the new management arrangements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a big change—we absolutely appreciate that—and we're working with industry to support them as best we can through that process, promoting sustainability to secure the future of this highly valuable industry. Our local fishers do an amazing job. But local recreational fishers tell me that some of the simple things we could be doing more of, at all levels of government, to support our fishers and grow future fishers are things like more local fishing infrastructure and greater fishing educational opportunities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recreational fishing on the New South Wales South Coast attracts an enormous amount of interest, and members of our local fishing clubs and our local fishing associations are great advocates for the fishing industry. The opportunities to make fishing more accessible and inclusive, to both retain and grow fishers, are very real. We are pleasingly seeing more females take up this exciting sport and recreational pursuit, and, as people age, we need to make sure that local fishing infrastructure provides support to enable the continuation of fishing and to also make sure that fishing is attractive and possible for people with a disability. Take, for example, the Tuross Head jetty that I was able to help fund with a $200,000 federal grant and officially open. It was with great local advocacy through the Tuross Head Progress Association and the Disability Inclusion Advisory Committee for Eurobodalla Shire Council that we learnt the jetty needed more points for people to hang onto—which is what occurred. This is a great example of a simple thing that makes a big difference. I've been told that this group is pushing for this to be part of the code for future local infrastructure.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Locals have also told me about the need for more educational opportunities to encourage people to experience fishing, and perhaps move into the fishing and seafood industry. The popular Gone Fishing Day is a great example, where people get to try fishing, but there needs to be more of these types of days. Educational opportunities, such as the Certificate II in Fishing Industry-Recreational Services, a TAFE delivered HSC VET content endorsed course, should be promoted more, as locals tell me that this is a very important pathway into the many and varied jobs in the fishing industry. As a former TAFE teacher who taught maritime studies at a variety of levels, I can certainly vouch for the importance of educational pathways playing a vital role in shaping our future workforce, careers and business opportunities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like many in this place, I'm a member of the Parliamentary Friends of the Australian Seafood Industry. I'm a friend of this group because I know how important fishing and seafood is to the New South Wales South Coast region. A while back, I got to see firsthand the diversity of fishing and seafood careers and our future leaders in the industry by attending the graduation of leaders in the National Seafood Industry Leadership Program. I was astounded at the opportunities out there. We just need to make sure, at all levels of government, that we are tapping in to help enable careers in the fishing industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And that takes me to the wonderful richness of history and culture of our commercial fishers at Ulladulla. We need to support our commercial fishers; we need to keep that tradition alive. One way the local Ulladulla community is doing that is with the annual blessing of the fleet, which started in 1956. Each Easter Sunday, Ulladulla comes alive with a festival full of Italian Catholic tradition to bless the fishing fleet for a plentiful catch and a safe return. I want to thank the Ulladulla blessing of the fleet committee and all our fishers across the region, both commercial and recreational, for all you do to support the fishing industry and our communities.</span>

                  <a href="265967" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WALLACE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:17</span>):  I represent what is undoubtedly the best electorate in the country. Fisher is the place of choice for education, employment and retirement. It's a place of industry, innovation and unparalleled natural beauty, and it boasts one of the oldest and most successful commercial fishery industries in the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fishing industry is one of the crucial primary industries which have long girded our national economy. It's one of the oldest industries in human history, and it will continue to play a vital role in ensuring food security for many years to come. The sector employs as many as 17,000 people and over 300 families on the Sunshine Coast. They rely on the industry to make ends meet in what is an increasingly difficult economic time. Cost of living is through the roof.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think of companies in my electorate like Walker Seafoods, one of Australia's best seafood exporters. Based in Mooloolaba, in my electorate, Walker Seafoods is Australia's only MSC certified tuna company. Walker Seafoods' swordfish and tuna recently featured in a Jamie Oliver special at Petermen dining.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently visited Mooloolaba Fisheries, which is a different business, where owner, Gary, and chef Paul have launched the Mooloolaba schnitty, a panko crumbed tuna version of the classic chicken schnitzel. It's very, very good. I encourage you all to try it. Gary told me, in my discussions with him just last week, that their power bills are set to jump by almost 75 per when he comes off contract. These increases in power costs could cripple a small business like Mooloolaba Fisheries. That is the reality of the Australian dream under this Albanese government. It is slipping out of the reach of everyday Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fishing is a quintessentially Australian industry. It deserves support from this government, yet this government has imposed a sustained assault on the industry. Those opposite meddled have with the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility Scheme. They've made backpacker visas more expensive and more restrictive. They've increased taxes on truckies and heavy vehicle road users and introduced a new biosecurity levy. They've imposed green tape and uniform bans on things like gillnets, risking 100 small and family businesses in Queensland alone. At the same time, state Labor are enforcing new quotas and catch bans on a wide range of fishing. This has knock-on effects for restaurants, packers, suppliers and a number of small businesses at the other end of the supply chain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was on the wharf at Mooloolaba last week, an industry participant was telling me that the prawning boats had been tied up at the wharf for six weeks—all of them—because of the Queensland state Labor government's forced moratorium on prawning for a six-week period. That might sound all well and good for some, but what about those people who are trying to make a living—the people who have huge mortgages on those boats and who employ so many people, on the wharf and in their factories? I've also spoken many times to other fisherman, who told me about their longlines, which can stretch out for kilometres. One of those longlines drifted into an area that was a no-fish area, and they were threatened with imprisonment and fines of over a million dollars. That was under the former federal Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government needs to remember and recognise that fishing is such an important industry. It provides us with our protein. Those opposite need to let our fishers do their job, and that is to go and fish. Governments need to get out of the pockets of small businesses.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">'In Australia, we believe that every student deserves the learning resources they need to thrive, but not every student is getting that chance. This is because of the current private-public school gap, which means that public schools are being deprived of adequate funding. Ninety-eight per cent of private schools are funded above the schooling resource standard, and more than 98 per cent of public schools are funded below it, even though the majority of students go to public schools. While private schools are able to afford new buildings and equipment, our school—a public school—couldn't even afford new books for the library last year. The money is going to the wrong place. We need to fix this.'</span>

If the government funds public schools more, our vision may become a reality. This change will benefit generations of learners to come. By giving every student in Australia equal opportunities, our country will prosper; by ignoring the majority, you are disadvantaging the potential leaders of tomorrow. Every student matters, right? So let's show them that they matter. Thank you.'</span>

The forest pledge is a promise by signatories to do what they can to help end native logging in this country. When I talk about native logging, I'm talking about industrial-scale native logging of our public native forests. We're in the middle of an extinction crisis, an environmental crisis and a climate crisis. Australia leads the world when it comes to mammal extinctions. We are responsible for 35 per cent of all mammal extinctions in the modern era. The last <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tate of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nvironment </span>report made for harrowing reading. We have 19 ecosystems on the brink of failure, and then we have the climate crisis. This year has been the hottest year on record, and we now know that getting to net zero by 2050 is probably not going to be nearly enough. We need to act and we need to act now. In this context, continuing to log our beautiful native forests is simply madness; it's morally wrong.</span>

It is also supported by 29 scientists, experts and academics, and, importantly, it is supported by former politicians and senior politicians, such as Bob Debus, Geoff Gallop and others. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  We all know on this side, as a government, how difficult it is right now for people to just get by—to just pay the basic bills. That's why we're absolutely focused on doing what we can to relieve that pressure. This includes investing billions of dollars into Australian homes and small businesses, because we know the cost of living is taking its toll on Australians. As a new government, we fought for and secured a pay rise for 2.8 million workers on the minimum wage. Our changes to child care, to make it even more affordable and accessible, came into effect in July this year, and 96 per cent of Australian families will be better off under Labor's childcare reforms. We're also tripling the bulk-billing incentive this month, because we want to make it cheaper and easier to see a GP today. We're implementing additional energy rebates in November. This will help eligible households by up to $500 and small businesses by up to $650. We're increasing the supply of affordable homes, with investments of $10 billion in the Housing Australia Future Fund and $350 million in the National Housing Accord, which will deliver thousands of new social and affordable rental homes. Most importantly, we're also supporting vulnerable women, children and families by building 4,000 new homes for those at risk of domestic violence and those who have survived domestic violence and homelessness. We are doing this because we care. We want to ensure that, no matter who you are or where you come from, you get a fair go. That's what Australian Labor is all about. That's what the Labor government is all about. </span>

I thank the wonderful team at the Mount Waverley Donor Centre for inviting me to donate, and for their kindness and dedication to their very important work.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">One in three Australians will need blood products in their lifetime, and that means we need a new blood donor every four minutes. One blood donation can save up to three lives. Blood or plasma donations are needed for things like cancer treatment, autoimmune condition, support after traumatic events, surgeries, and neonatal procedures. We have around 4,200 active blood donors in the Chisholm electorate, but thousands more people in our electorate are eligible to donate. People in Chisholm have saved up to 36,108 lives in the past 12 months alone by donating blood. I urge people in my community to become a regular blood donor if they are able to, and to add to this number of lives saved. If you can, please consider giving the gift of life, and donate blood.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McPherson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:19</span>):  The Gold Coast is an absolutely fantastic place to live and to work, but the cost-of-living increases are really hitting many people in my community very hard. The interest rate rise on Melbourne Cup day is yet another blow—that's probably the best way to describe it—for Gold Coasters. We have, over the last few months, endured many rate increases, along with the rest of Australia. The cost of renting accommodation—if you can find it—is going through the roof on the Gold Coast. It is really difficult for many people in our community to be able to make ends meet.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only is it the rising interest rates, the difficulty in finding accommodation and the cost of finding accommodation, but also the increased prices for electricity and gas. They're all making it so hard for everyday Australians living on the Gold Coast to make ends meet. It is every single day that people contact me—whether they see me when I'm out and about or contact me via email or call my office—and all of them are talking about the rising cost of living and how hard it is for them to be able to make ends meet.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We rely very heavily on tourism on the Gold Coast and we will start to see, potentially, some declines in that and declines in the spend when people come to the Gold Coast. That will continue to hurt the Gold Coast. We need to make the government make some changes.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:20</span>):  I recently had the absolute honour of seeing a code stroke demonstration at Shoalhaven District Memorial Hospital for World Stroke Day. My electorate of Gilmore on the New South Wales South Coast is ranked sixth in Australia for both the number of Australians living with stroke and annual stroke cases. Shoalhaven hospital's stroke team, along with the Angels Initiative, do outstanding work in our local hospital to treat patients experiencing a stroke, and it was fascinating to see that work firsthand. Amazingly, Shoalhaven hospital is the first regional hospital in Australia to earn platinum status by the World Stroke Organization—a true testament to the hospital's amazing healthcare staff. For World Stroke Day, I was proud to present the hospital staff with their eighth gold award for outstanding patient care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Management of stroke requires multidisciplinary teamwork, including participation of ambulance, triage, emergency department, radiology, stroke team and the New South Wales Telestroke Service. A stroke is always a medical emergency and time to treatment is a critical factor affecting outcomes for patients. For every 15 minutes shortened between the onset of stroke symptoms to treatment each year, 380 more Australians will walk out of hospital under their own power, 345 will be able to take care of themselves at home after they leave hospital and 345 will survive their stroke. Thank you to all the amazing healthcare workers on the Shoalhaven stroke team, as well as the Angels Initiative, for the work you do to save lives in our community every day. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:22</span>):  One of the many joys we have all begun to experience again in a post-pandemic world is the return of the wonderful agricultural shows. We're well into show season in northern Tasmania, with the Launceston show held in early October while the fabulous Ringarooma School &amp; District Show was another roaring success this past weekend.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This coming Friday and Saturday, almost 5,000 people are expected to come through the gate for the Scottsdale Show, now in its 118th year. I'm delighted to be their show patron this year. This year Alice Hall is in the driving seat of the North Eastern Agricultural &amp; Pastoral Society and is the third generation of her family to do so, taking over as president from her father, Trevor, and her grandfather Lance, who was president from 1968 to 1975. 'It's nice to continue the tradition,' Alice told the local newspaper, the <span style="font-style:italic;">North Eastern Advertiser</span>. Trevor Hall said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">We always showed cattle and it was a family thing … This will be my 55th year exhibiting so if COVID hadn't happened it would have been 57 …</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As always, old favourites like cattle and machinery will be front and centre and of course, like any good rural show, it's only as good as the amazing volunteers who work tirelessly to put it together. As the patron, I'll be judging the pet parade and the Miss Tiny Tots, which fills me with a slight bit of dread as it may be akin to choosing my favourite child, but I will give it my best. Good luck for the Scottsdale Show this weekend. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:24</span>):  What a fantastic Sunday we had across the country when Hindu, Sikh and Jain communities gathered together to celebrate the auspicious festival of lights known by many names including Diwali, Deepavali and Tihar. This festive season is a time of profound significance and joy for over a billion people across the world. It marks the triumph of light over darkness, good over evil and knowledge over ignorance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The festival is marked by people gathering together and sharing food and sweets to express their love and respect for one another. As many in our communities illuminate their homes with diyas and vibrant decorations, they also illuminate their hearts with hope and positivity. These celebrations not only add vibrancy to our society but also serve as reminders of the values we collectively cherish—values of unity, diversity and respect. As I wish the Hindu, Sikh and Jain communities a happy Diwali, Deepavali and Tihar, I also affirm our nation's commitment to fostering understanding and unity among all communities that call Australia home. Once again, from the bottom of my heart, I would like to wish every single person that is celebrating Diwali, Deepavali and Tihar a happy Diwali, Deepavali and Tihar.</span>

Diwali celebrates the victory of good over evil, light over darkness and knowledge over ignorance. The religious significance of the five-day Diwali festival varies regionally within India. It is not limited to any one narrative. It is a celebration of the diversity, beliefs and traditions within the Indian community. This diversity is what makes the Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain and Indian culture so rich and so vibrant. More than 680,000 people follow Hinduism in Australia. They contribute immensely to the cultural, social and economic fabric of our nation. I must say our Indian community bring so much light, colour and entertainment and make Australia the greatest nation on Earth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, the festival of lights is celebrated by increasing numbers of Australians from all backgrounds across the nation. Already small to large institutions and businesses allow their employees to take a cultural holiday for Diwali, and I hope to see this accepted in future workplaces, where businesses are allowed to work with their employees to make it happen. I recently had the great honour of joining the member for Dickson, the opposition leader, for his first Indian trip as apposition leader. Again, I thank the Indian community in India for their great hospitality. Finally, I very much look forward to an India-Australia World Cup final. Go Australia.</span>

In the forefront, this is the Nakba of Gaza. The Nakba of Gaza 2023: that's how it will end.' These are not my words nor the words of a shock jock. These are the words of senior Israeli minister Avi Dichter, a member of Israel's security cabinet. When another Israeli minister was asked if the expectation is that Israel will drop what amounts to 'some kind of nuclear bomb on all of Gaza, flattening them, eliminating everybody there', he responded: 'That's one way. The second way is to work out what's important to them, what scares them, what deters them.' I can tell you what's important: Palestinian children and their families being killed and lives destroyed.</span>

This weekend I received calls from constituents who reported to me hundreds of family members killed, traumatised and displaced in this catastrophe—family members left injured and trapped, literally living among corpses with no end in sight. A ceasefire must be immediate. We must demand it now, not as another process but now and not tomorrow, because every second counts.</span>

I go around in my electorate and see that legitimate businesses out there are suffering because of all of these illegal tobacco shops opening up and selling this illegal product. It's costing about $4.2 billion a year in revenue to the federal government. There are two ways to handle this. Of course, one of them is to reduce the tax on it so that there's not such a big price difference, and that removes the black market altogether. At the moment, we collect around $12.7 billion in taxes and excise from legitimate sales. The cost to the health system is about $6.8 billion, so we are in front. That doesn't include the conservative estimate of $4.2 billion that we're missing out on.</span>

That's caused an entire new issue. Sometimes, with governments, we have the best intentions. We all want smoking rates to drop. This has helped somewhat, but it has gone too far. It is akin to putting the speed limit down to 20 kilometres an hour. It's just gone too far. It's time to look at this and maybe change the way that we do things. We need to reduce the price of the tax on the legitimate cigarettes so that there's not that big of a difference, and we need to drive the black market out of business because it's got to go.</span>

Singleton Council delivers fantastic outcomes for people that call Singleton home. Singleton Council were awarded the AR Bluett for the area's liveability and for how they are moving to meet the future head-on. Singleton is a community and an economy known for coal and agriculture, but the council and the community are working together to shift the paradigm from the here and now to the future. I give a huge congratulations to the council's general manager, Jason Linnane, and his incredible staff. And congratulations to Mayor Sue Moore, Deputy Mayor Tony Jarrett and Councillors Godfrey Adamthwaite, Sue George, Hollee Jenkins— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:42</span>):  Last week I met with Taj and the team at the ASE Group's Australian schools of employment and entrepreneurship. Their mission is to equip every Australian with the skills, resources and mindset they need to start a business and enter the workforce, regardless of their postcode. I met Mo, who is actually from Woodridge, which is in both the state Treasurer's and federal Treasurer's electorates in South-East Queensland. He is running not just one business but two businesses. Firstly, he's training to be a local barber, and his business is called LocalBlendz. Secondly, he has an apparel business called LoveLiveFashion. We went through one of ASE's many successful employment programs with them, and Mo told me all about the opportunity that he received going through the program.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">ASE received funding from the former coalition government to run their self-employment assistance program. In one year, participants of the program generated—wait for it—over $1.4 million in revenue. That's entrepreneurialism at its best. We know that ASE does great work, and yet this government cut crucial funding for them that we promised in the last term of government. The government abolished the Entrepreneurship Facilitators Program, a low-cost program that has achieved some success. Why? We know that this job-killing, short-sighted Labor government doesn't like small business and doesn't support the entrepreneurial spirit in this country, even in Woodridge.</span>

This is what the new causeway pedestrian and cycling bridge will do. At the moment, about 3,000 pedestrians and cyclists cross the Swan River daily. Today there are about 100 people working on the fabrication of this bridge. It's a jointly funded project between the WA Labor government and the federal government, and it's coming to life right now at Civmec's workshop in Henderson.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two weeks ago, I joined the Premier and Deputy Premier in WA—that's Roger Cook and Rita Saffioti. We went down to Civmec's workshop, and it was bloody big and really impressive. It was a bit like Disneyland for me. Of course, I am the daughter of a metalworker. You should have seen the pride of the metalworkers and the welders. This bridge is an example of 'if we can build it here, we should build it here', especially if it's government infrastructure—WA manufacturing and WA jobs.</span>

This is what Labor governments do. This bridge will fill workshops, create jobs, attract skilled workers and foster a homegrown industry. The design of the bridge is very impressive such that it has become a finalist in the We Ride Australia Cycling Luminaries Awards.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm extremely proud to be here moving this motion in this place as the member for Spence today, and that pride is extended by the fact that I'm doing so on a matter that is vitally important to Australia, vitally important to South Australia and, I would firmly argue, vitally important to those in the northern suburbs—namely, in my electorate of Spence. That matter is vocational education and training.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In large part, over the relatively short life span of this parliament, I have had the opportunity to speak to the importance of education, whether that be about child care or preschool, primary and secondary school education, vocational education, higher education or the educators that help to nurture future generations of Australians. I know that a strong education sector means a stronger Australia. It means stronger outcomes for our kids when they go out into their chosen professions later in life. Upskilling, or the decision to upskill, can be the crossroad moment in someone's life. It can unlock a pathway to stable employment. It can unlock pathways to promotions within their current job or field. It can unlock someone's ability to find employment in an entirely different industry—one in demand not just today but tomorrow and for many years to come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Education is what can uplift people, uplift families and uplift communities out of poverty, which is why any good government, state or federal, treats education as a cornerstone underpinning many areas of policy. It is one that pays out almost immediately, but the real dividends are gained in the long term. The Albanese Labor government realised this whilst it was still in opposition. In doing so, Labor announced a suite of policies and ideals that eventually became the Jobs and Skills Summit, which has led to the establishment of Jobs and Skills Australia, which has led to many of us incorporating the word 'tripartite' into our vocabularies. Starting with the Jobs and Skills Summit, it identified short-term and long-term challenges that exist within Australia's labour market and it identified vocational education and training as one of the key means of addressing these challenges head on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Skills Agreement is a partnership between the federal government and state and territory governments, a joint commitment between governments across Australia to expand and transform our vocational education and training sectors. The National Skills Agreement means a $12.6 billion investment from our government into the VET sector over five years. Namely, in comparison to higher education, vocational education and training has often been seen by many as the poorer cousin, a consolation prize for some school leavers who are told they aren't cut out for higher education. The National Skills Agreement, I hope, will go a long way to changing perceptions of how TAFE and other vocational education and training providers are seen as part of our education system and as part of the delivery of strategic shifts within our labour market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A good example of this is the <span style="font-style:italic;">South Australian defence industry workforce and skills report</span> and the prominent role that TAFE and VET has within the overall success of South Australia to grow an already flourishing defence industry into an industry that will continue to provide jobs in our state for many decades to come—a plan that was unveiled on Friday with the Minister of Defence, alongside Premier Peter Malinauskas just this Friday gone. It's the product of many months of hard work across government, industry and the education sector, with stable and well-paying jobs for our future workforce, some of whom may not even be in school yet or even been born.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But without possessing a long-term vision and a plan to grow and adjust our skills base to reflect the needs of the future, we will forever be attempting to fix challenges and issues within our labour market one day at a time. From the year preceding May 2023, 91 per cent of total employment growth occurred in occupations requiring post-school qualifications, with VET accounting for over half of that growth. Challenges such as three million Australians currently lacking fundamental skills required to participate in training, leading to secure work. Challenges like nine out of 10 new jobs requiring post-secondary school education, and four out of 10 of those jobs requiring VET qualifications.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the challenges that the Albanese Labor government aims to address from day one, although though it has not done so alone. In addition to state and territory governments, this process has been assisted by the industries themselves, businesses and unions working alongside each other to make a real difference for our future growth. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="109556" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LEESER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:51</span>):  I have many criticisms of this government, given its ongoing failings—its failure to have a plan to cut interest rates and drive down inflation, its inability to get spending under control, its decision on national security to play footsies with the Corbynite Left—but there's one area where this government operates in a rarefied air, where it has no peer or equal, where it excels beyond anywhere imaginable, and that is in the area of self-congratulations. This is a government that believes what it wants to believe even when the facts tell a different story. As a government, it's all talking points and no answers. It's a government that either blames others or congratulates itself, and this motion is typical of the self-congratulation genre.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government prides itself on the establishment of Jobs and Skills Australia, it says. As opposition leader, Anthony Albanese said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We will create a new and independent agency to be called Jobs and Skills Australia which will research workforce trends and provide impartial advice about what skills are needed now and what skills will be sought after in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It sounds like a great idea, except the Morrison government was already doing it. Jobs and Skills Australia is just a rebranding of the National Skills Commission established by the Morrison government: same staff in the same department in the same building drawing the same pay cheques with a new logo. It's like an episode of <span style="font-style:italic;">Utopia</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion of self-congratulation celebrates the new National Skills Agreement. The government boasts that through the National Skills Agreement it's providing an increase of over $3.7 billion over the next five years. That would have been paid through the previously operating agreement; that amount would have been $12.6 billion. High fives all round, except this is the same funding level as committed to by the coalition in 2022. So if you want to offer praise, I say start with the member for Cook, his Skills Commission and his funding envelope.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, this is the same funding envelope that caused Labor to say—erroneously—that the coalition was cutting money out of TAFE. Now Labor celebrates the fact it has a National Skills Agreement with the states and territories. It secured one because it gave away the fundamental bargaining position of a Commonwealth, namely that arrangements needed to be tied to outcomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you believe this motion, Australia is entering a new nirvana when it comes to skills. The first year of the government's performance says that's not the case. Data from the National Centre for Vocational Education Research shows that in Labor's first year of government, new training starts have declined by more than 37 per cent. Of even greater concern is the decline in commencements for female trainees in apprenticeships. It's about 43 per cent. We are witnessing a collapse in commencements. That means there are 37,000 fewer Australians commencing training than when Labor took government. That means in only one year the supply of new electricians, mechanics, childcare workers, cooks and carpenters will slow, and in a country already facing skills shortages that's terrible news. It's a warning of darker days to come. And labour shortages and supply chain pressures all feed into higher inflation, with shortages harming those areas where we need significant growth, particularly in the care sector and in the digital economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion also contains the obligatory condemnation of the last coalition government. These motions are a sort of standard cocktail formula with three parts self-congratulation, one part condemnation, shaken not stirred. Yet the facts disprove the condemnation. In the final months of the last coalition government, trade apprentices in training hit record highs with over 415,240 apprentices and trainees in training. That was up 21.6 per cent for the same time in 2021. Under Labor, we've seen trade apprentices in training numbers fall to 387,500, a 6.6 per cent fall in one year. This from a government who promised they had all the answers for skill and trade shortages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All we get from this government is marketing and rebadging. We've had TAFE centres of excellence promised. Like most Albanese government announcements, it has been announced and re-announced many times. But still, halfway through the term, we don't know where the centres are going, we don't know what they're going to do and we don't know what their role will be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government with no sense of urgency. This is despite the fact that the Skills Priority List found that 36 per cent of occupations are experiencing shortages. That is 332 occupations out of 916. That's up five percentage points, or 66 occupations. And those shortages are occurring across vital areas such as health care, ICT and the trades. There are shortages across the construction sector and outside it, with persistent shortages in occupations like chefs, motor mechanics, fitters, hairdressers and metal fabricators.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia needs a robust, vibrant economy that doesn't suffer from these skill shortages. And so what do we on this side of House want to see? We want to see the government stop congratulating itself on a job not done and get back to working on removing the skills blockages that are hindering national productivity and economic growth.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:56</span>):  I want to thank the member for Spence for bringing this motion to the House. Indeed, I'd like to congratulate him for doing so. I know the member is a passionate advocate for working people and fights hard to not only protect the conditions of workers in his electorate but also to create real opportunities for the future. I want to thank the Minister for Skills and Training, Brendan O'Connor, the member for Gorton, for the government's introduction of a suite of policies to help address this nation's significant skills and labour shortages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A future made in Australia must mean that we make things locally and that we make them here. The landmark five-year National Skills Agreement will embed national cooperation and strategic investment in our vocational education and training sector. The Albanese government is prepared to invest $12.6 billion to expand and transform access to the VET sector, support quality training and implement reforms to address critical skills needs. If states and territories access all the Commonwealth funding available under the National Skills Agreement, the combined investment by governments would exceed $30 billion over five years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In an historic first, a new national stewardship model will coordinate strategic investment in skills across the economy and support delivery of skills needed in national priority areas, as well as providing states and territories with flexibility to meet local industry skills needs. The agreement places TAFE at the heart of the VET sector with TAFEs to be supported by baseline funding commitments. Ours is a government that believes in a whole-of-government approach to governance so that industries are secured, so that supply chains are revived, so that families can once again have the job security that has allowed so many people in my electorate to build a life for themselves and their family, and so that we can secure our nation's economic security through a sovereign capability that can help our economy become crisis proof.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I am proud of our government's efforts with policies that include the Australian Skills Guarantee, which will ensure one in 10 workers on major federally funded government projects is an apprentice, trainee or cadet—this translates to a commitment to training thousands of workers. Our Fee-Free TAFE places are delivering 465,000 fee-free TAFE places, including 45,000 new places, and includes those for students studying in industries of national importance and those facing skills shortages. And the TAFE Technology Fund ensures that at least 70 per cent of Commonwealth VET funding is for public TAFE.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Calwell is home to the Kangan Institute of TAFE in Broadmeadows, an institution that is doing great work towards skills training in key sectors of our local and national economy, whether it be in trades, business, IT, justice, community, children's services, hospitality, animals, plants and sciences. I also want to thank them for their collaboration and support at the Kangan Institute Skills and Jobs Centre, with their on-the-tools experience facilitated by the AMWU and Women Onsite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Future Made in Australia Skills Plan, covering a number of commitments made as part of the government's $1.2 billion Future Made in Australia Skills Plan, is helping close the gap on key areas of skills shortage. New energy apprenticeships will encourage Australians to train in the new energy jobs of the future and provide the additional support they need to complete their training. That's a funding commitment of $100 million to support 10,000 new energy apprenticeships and a new energy skills program to develop fit-for-purpose training pathways for new energy industry jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen the success of this government's policies and their real-world impact. Fee-free TAFE and VET has been such a success that we're committing a further $414.1 million to deliver an additional 300,000 places nationally to begin next year. The fee-free TAFE initiative has had overwhelming success in its first year, exceeding the 180,000 enrolment target by almost 40,000 students, hitting nearly 215,000 enrolments. Fee-free TAFE is providing substantial savings to students and providing post-secondary education to students who might not otherwise have had the opportunity to pursue it. It's been a real game changer across Victoria and in my electorate, with more than 152,000 students saving more than $384 million in tuition fees since the program began in 2019. The Albanese Labor government's strong commitment to skills and training towards productive employment means that we invest in the skills and the workforce of the future.</span>

I'm very pleased to say that I had a great career in the building industry as a carpenter and then as a builder. I often tell young people at any schools to get a trade. So many young people now—and I'll confess to doing this because otherwise my kids will hold me to account—have it impressed upon them that they've got to go to university, and I think we have done our kids a disservice in doing that. There's nothing wrong with going to university. We obviously need people to go to university. But not everybody has to go to university. I think we've lost the plot in this country to an extent because we push so many young people to university education. I know that, if you go to TAFE and get a trade in this country, you can basically work anywhere in the world. TAFE training in this country is very well regarded across the world. If you are a carpenter in Australia, you'll get a job in Canada, and, if you are an electrician in Australia, you'll get a job in the United States et cetera. It is very, very highly regarded.</span>

                  </a>  It took the former coalition government nine years to repair the damage that those members opposite inflicted upon the vocational education sector. In those nine years, we delivered JobTrainer, which provided low-fee or no-fee training before the states did. We incentivised apprenticeship commencements and completions, with a record 387,830 apprentices and trainees, building a skilled workforce. We reformed the recognition-of-prior-learning schemes and we backed skilled sectors. We made training more accessible and affordable for young Australians, first responders, veterans and senior career professionals alike. Without fanfare—as was our wont—the coalition delivered on vocational education and training.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the other hand, take Labor's approach. Labor flung mud, slogans and union-drafted talking points over the parapet right up until the Prime Minister moved into the Lodge. Now their great boast is that they've sold the Australian economy down the river, and for what? For a national skills agreement which is weaker than ever, more expensive and, frankly, without much substance at all. They announced so-called TAFE centres of excellence—they've rebranded them and re-announced them a couple more times, but we still don't know what they'll do, where they'll be or what purpose they'll have. It's all the more curious given TAFEs are state government responsibilities. This federal government is all at sea when it comes to vocational education and training. In 12 months, we've seen that photo-ops, jetsetting and big announcements are all that Labor has to offer. They are now tearing the sector apart once again.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:17</span>):  When the Albanese government came to power, it was confronted with a number of alarming situations, none more pressing than an economy on the ropes and a staggering skills deficit that threatened to undermine our nation's future prosperity. Upon taking office, the government had to deal with a genuine skills crisis. Occupations on the skills shortage list had skyrocketed from 153 to a staggering 286. According to the OECD, Australia was facing the second-most-severe labour shortage in the developed world—a stark reminder of the urgency of the situation we then faced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Never forget the decade of cuts to TAFE and the VET sector administered by state and federal Liberal governments. Those opposite have never shown a commitment to TAFE and the VET sector during their tenure, and they were on an ideological mission to destroy TAFE through cuts, sales and privatisation. Their longstanding opposition to TAFE and vocational education speaks volumes about their priorities and their commitment to addressing the pressing skills shortage we face today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I'm proud to be a part of a government that understands that a strong and accessible higher education and vocational education and training sector is crucial not only to tackling this skill shortage but to creating a better future for all Australians. To fix our skills shortage and grow our economy, the Albanese government is investing in our country's greatest resource—our people. The cost-of-living stress that Australians face today is immense. The rising cost of housing, utilities and groceries, coupled with stagnant wage growth, has cast a shadow over the household budgets of many.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fee-free TAFE is a critical measure in the suite of policies this government is implementing against the cost-of-living crisis. Its impact extends beyond the classroom, offering a lifeline to individuals seeking to re-skill and redefine their careers. When the cost of living soars, individuals often find themselves at a crossroad, contemplating the daunting prospect of balancing expenses versus a desire to re-skill or upskill. Through fee-free TAFE, this government has removed the financial barrier that holds many back from accessing education, upskilling and getting a better paid job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As industries evolve and technological advancements reshape the employment landscape, staying relevant in the workforce requires adaptability. Fee-free TAFE not only opens the door to reskilling but also widens the avenues for securing better employment opportunities. Because of fee-free TAFE, Australians now have the opportunity to get better jobs with higher pay. One of the most significant achievements of this policy is its contribution to addressing skills shortages in various sectors. Whether it's in the care sector, agriculture, hospitality, construction, technology or defence, this government is delivering essential skills at a time when they are most needed, and the numbers back it up. There were over 214,300 enrolments in the first six months, surpassing the 2023 target of 180,000 by nearly 35,000 places. It has been a resounding success.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've got an example from Bennelong. I met Claire, a mother of two, who is the perfect example of what this policy was designed to deliver. Claire's fee-free TAFE journey is real, and it shows how good government and good policies can help good people. For years, Claire had worked tirelessly in the media industry to provide for her kids. It was a path she had chosen, but over time Claire began to yearn for a change—a change that would not only enrich her life but also offer greater opportunities for her kids and her family. However, Claire found changing careers to be hard. The financial barriers to changing careers are daunting. The costs of reskilling, and balancing that with the family budget, can become too much of a burden. However, thanks to this policy, Claire is now on a different path. With our policy, she not only enrolled in an accounting course but also gained the confidence and skills needed to change her career. When she finishes her fee-free TAFE course, she wants to open a small accounting practice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Claire's story reminds us all that fee-free TAFE is not merely about statistics and numbers; it's about real people and their dreams, and it's also about growing our economy. This policy is a lifeline that has opened doors for many individuals from all walks of life and from different backgrounds and experiences. It has fuelled the aspirations of mothers, fathers, young Australians, jobseekers, people with disabilities and First Nations Australians. It's about providing a ladder of upward mobility and, importantly, it's about productivity and growing our economy.</span>

Despite the claims made in this motion, Jobs and Skills Australia advice clearly shows that the number of Australians taking up new training has declined by 37.4 per cent, in spite of the new National Skills Agreement by Labor. According to those opposite, the Labor government's TAFE proposal promised a revolution in Australian skills, but we actually see the opposite. There's been a devolution in the take-up of Australian skills. In spite of the government's much vaunted five-year agreement with the states, it actually comes on the back of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, where the government couldn't get the Victorian Labor government to sign onto it at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as this, the Albanese government has been spruiking the TAFE centres of excellence as a key component of the skills commitment, with $325 million over five years to be invested federally. The centres, in the words of the government, will strengthen the collaboration between TAFEs, unis, industries and higher apprenticeship qualifications. However, South Regional TAFE, in my electorate, already offers business development services, which is an industry-focused unit providing services to local businesses. Where will the centres of excellence be in WA, and how will they impact on the business development services already being provided by that TAFE? Equally, if the government bothered to meet with the private RTOs around the country, they would be well aware that many of the benefits that these centres of excellence are intending to provide are already being delivered by the private VET sector. I met a range of RTOs that are currently doing much of the heavy lifting, and they feel as though they've been abandoned by the Labor government at a critical time of skills shortages, when all they are seeking is a level playing field. They have an important role to play in training and skills development and offer choice for those seeking that training. Data compiled by the Independent Tertiary Education Council of Australia has found that independent schools not only provide courses that have significantly higher completion rates—and that will be the key to what the government is doing here—but also do so with higher satisfaction rates among the students.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The number of Australians taking up skills training is in freefall under the Albanese government. Trade apprentices in training hit record highs in the final months of the coalition government. As of June 2022, there were more than 415,240 apprentices and trainees in training, which was 21 per cent higher than at the same time in 2021. Under Labor, this number has now fallen to 387,505. We see those skills shortages in industries right across the country. I see and hear of this shortage every single day in my electorate in the south-west of Western Australia. We should have apprentices lining up to take on the amazing opportunities a trade provides them. The latest data demonstrates that while the Prime Minister talks a big game on skills, he just isn't delivering. In fact, he has overseen an almost 40-per-cent decline in new training starts in his first year alone. The skills shortages have worsened, and 36 per cent of occupations assessed were five per cent higher on the skills priority list than in 2022.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I support students getting the best education and training they possibly can—training that meets the career choices that they have—but we do need to see the benefits of what the government is spending, and I am concerned that the TAFE certificate completion rates are well below their private RTO counterparts. Certificate I has a 16 per cent discrepancy, and what we can't afford is taxpayers' funding being wasted or going down the drain without completion and without qualification, and with no benefit to the individual, the businesses that desperately need skilled and trained workers, or the broader economy and to productivity. Every single bit of public funding needs to be effective, particularly when we see such skills shortages and productivity continuing in freefall—it's now down 6.6 per cent.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The benefits of golf extend far beyond the boundaries of the golf course. From building communities to preserving our natural treasures, from promoting physical and mental wellbeing to contributing to our economy, golf is a sport that enriches us in many ways. Across my electorate of Forde, there are five golf courses: Carbrook Golf Club, Windaroo Lakes Golf Club, Riverlakes Golf Course, Meadowbrook Golf Club, and the Beenleigh RSL and Mt Warren Park Golf Club. Each of these clubs plays a significant part in the community—economically, environmentally and socially, and for mental health benefits. As we look at the work that these golf clubs do across my community, we see those benefits each and every day, from the juniors all the way to those older—or, more advanced in age—golfers who enjoy getting out on a Saturday morning and having a hit, and everyone in between.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also see the big headline tournaments both overseas on TV and also here locally in Australia. Later this month the Australian PGA championship will be held in Brisbane at the Royal Queensland Golf Club. The Australian PGA championship is one of the major highlights of this year's summer of golf and will see the world tour season commence in Brisbane. An all-star field of Australian and international players will compete for the Joe Kirkwood Cup and some $2 million in prize money—the richest prize on the Challenger PGA Tour of Australasia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Approximately 3.5 million Australians have participated in various formats of golf over the last 12 months. Currently, there are over 1,600 golf facilities in Australia, including golf courses, minigolf courses, driving ranges and a growing number of indoor simulators and entertainment venues. Importantly, golf generates around $10.3 billion per annum in household expenditure, which includes $3.6 billion associated with golf tourism. I know, as I go out on some of my local courses, I well and truly contribute to that via balls lost or mis-hit in the process. Golf tourism attracts visitors from around the globe, showcasing our picturesque courses and promoting local businesses. From the golf equipment manufacturers to the hospitality services, the industry generates employment opportunities and stimulates economic growth. Furthermore, golf events, both local and international, draw attention to Australia on a global scale, showcasing the country as a premier destination for sports and recreation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take this opportunity to mention a few of those events at my local golf clubs, which I mentioned earlier. The Carbrook Classic is a staple on our local golf calendar every year, bringing together golfers from not just South-East Queensland but around Australia to compete in a two-day event on one of the best golf courses, I believe, in South-East Queensland. The Windaroo Lakes Golf Club have a pro-am series every year, of which I am proud to be but a small sponsor. Again, they bring together a range of golfers from around the country, particularly trainee professionals and other professionals, who have the opportunity to hone their skills on a terrific golf course, which used to be the host of the Queensland PGA many years ago. The Mt Warren Park Golf Club holds a veterans day every year, in memory of our veterans and to raise funds for their veterans services. It's always well attended by our local community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, many of these golf clubs also have function centres and restaurants that not only support the golfers when they're out playing but also provide the ability for community groups to host events at these various centres. All of this contributes to the fabric of our society. These golf activities generate important benefits for golfers and the community at large. I know at Windaroo Lakes—I think it's once a month—they have a ladies 'chip &amp; sip', which my wife has enjoyed more than once. I suspect there's more sipping than chipping, but the ladies thoroughly enjoy the afternoon and it's great to see them out on the golf course. It's also for the juniors. I want to thank all of our golf clubs for the tremendous work they do right across our community.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DAVID SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bean</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:33</span>):  It's safe to say that my views on this motion are on par with that of my colleagues. They are not a fairway removed. Apologies for the bad puns. There'll be no more. The electorate of Bean and the ACT are home to some of the great golf courses in the country, with golfers enjoying some of the best natural landscapes while often navigating kangaroos and other wildlife. Stretching from the Murrumbidgee Country Club in my electorate, to Royal Canberra Golf Club, Federal Golf Club, Yowani Country Club and Capital Golf Club, and to the Fairbairn, Belconnen, Gold Creek and Gungahlin Lakes clubs in the northern part of the ACT, Canberrans of all ages have a diverse range of options to choose from.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say 'all ages' because one of the unique aspects of golf is that it is a sport that allows everyday Australians to be engaged in physical activity, from childhood to older age. There is simply no age barrier to this sport. Golf is shown to provide moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity and therefore could be expected to have beneficial effects on longevity, physical health, mental health and overall wellness. Walking around an average course for a round of golf can be between five and seven kilometres. If you walk 18 holes three to five times a week, you'll get an optimal amount of endurance exercise for your heart.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Golf also provides important benefits for people's social health. Golf facilitates social interaction between friends and community members, thereby reducing feelings of loneliness and isolation that may otherwise occur. Beyond benefits for golfers, golf clubs and their facilities are often community meeting hubs which help to generate a sense of belonging, especially in regional and rural areas where such facilities can be lacking. Analysis from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Community </span><span style="font-style:italic;">benefits of golf </span><span style="font-style:italic;">in Australia</span> report for 2023 has found that 166,000 Australians are physically active with golf but would be considered inactive without it.

                  </a>  In addition to the health benefits, our golf courses regularly host charity events. Such events contribute to broader investment in the health and wellbeing of Australians. Early in the day, I mentioned the Menslink Great Walk. As part of our fundraising for this great Canberra organisation, Paul Eccles ran a successful golf charity day at the Federal Golf Club a few weeks ago. On the subject of the Menslink Great Walk, may I commend the particular fundraising and walking efforts of Sarah Rajic from Capital Recruit, who was participating in this 142 kilometre walk for the third time. Over the last 12 months, Australia's golf courses hosted 1.5 million golfers, while a further 1.2 million played off course at a range of spaces including driving ranges, minigolf facilities—about my standard—and simulators.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The community benefits report also discussed the environmental benefits that golf courses contribute to national ecology. It was found that an 18-hole golf course produces enough oxygen annually to sustain around 85,000 people. In addition to this, Australia's golf courses and driving ranges provide enough oxygen to sustain around 80 million people. The message is clear: golf is one of the biggest sports in Australia, contributing significant economic, social and environmental benefits to golfers and the Australian community. The Albanese government recognises this contribution and is supporting golf through high-performance, wellbeing budgets and 2024 Paris Olympic Games preparation and funding. I thank the member for Forde for proposing this almost-Greens motion and commend it to the House.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GILLESPIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:49</span>):  I definitely agree with this motion because I strongly believe in the benefits of golf. It's a very popular game. There are 3½ million Australians who play golf, aged between 18 and 79. If you include children, you might even top that by another 100,000. In my electorate of Lyne, I have—and I've mentioned just about all of them—Camden Haven; Wauchope; Port Macquarie, across the border at the edge of my electorate; Emerald Downs, likewise; Taree; Harrington; Forster Tuncurry Golf Club; Dungog; Gloucester; and nearby Newcastle.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Golf is one of the biggest sports in Australia. The health benefits, both physical and mental, are extensive. It has many positive flow-on effects. It's an active, healthy lifestyle and it generates vital open spaces. Green spaces and environments are created by golf courses. They're also cultural hubs. They're a big employer. Annually, there are over $3.3 billion worth of benefits to the Australian economy from golf. The actual expenditure by households is quite staggering, and golf tourism is a major industry. Golf tourism generates $3.6 billion. Household expenditure, expenditure on the facilities themselves and payments by golfers is about $10 billion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that many people are not aware of is it's a very egalitarian sport. Anyone can play it. And while the wonders of the modern world are many, one of them is the Stableford handicap, which means you can play with Greg Norman or Chris Smith or anyone. And if you've got a handicap of 41, you might catch him or her! It is a great game.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an environmental treasure. Did you know that open green spaces, golf courses, are right up there. There's greater thermal comfort, especially in city areas, like around Centennial Park, where they're trying to close down half a golf course and turn it into green space. So they're closing a golf course, which is full of green space, to create green space. Go figure that out. Connect the dots. Aha! There's real estate involved. That means, across the road, many more real estate developments can happen because if the golf course is attributed to a golf course and not to the owners of the land across the road then, hey presto, they can't build high-rises. So if you want to work out what's going on in Sydney, look at the real estate and follow the money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also benefits for water filtration and purification. Many golf courses are part of sewage systems, natural sewage systems. Soil and vegetation benefit from it. There's reduced impact from flooding and management of storm water. Carbon reductions from emissions are absorbed by these golf courses. Each year, carbon sequestration services from golf courses total $6 million—I think some of the golf clubs need to get some carbon credits out of their business as well! There's enough oxygen produced by all those plants to support 85,000 human beings. There are also the local ecosystems. There are more insects per square 100 metres than there are in ordinary suburbia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a great game. You can play it with your children, you can play it with your wife, you can play with total strangers and at the end of it you've got a friend for life on many occasions. And you perpetually have something to worry about apart from your job or parliament or anything like that. It's to be commended.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I support the golf industry because of all those benefits. It is not a game for rich tossers. There are more golf courses in Australia than in most other countries—1,600 of them in fact. That's why we have so many professional golfers. Look at the women's golf circuit; look at the seniors, or geriatric, golf circuit—it's a game for all ages and all causes. I thoroughly commend people to take up golf. And I ask the New South Wales government to keep the Centennial Park golf course as a golf course. All those people in high-rises all use it; there are 3,000 people every day on Centennial Park golf course.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:54</span>):  I want to support the motion that has been put forward by the member for Forde in support of golf. It's so interesting, and the member for Lyne is correct when he says that golf is often portrayed as a game for elites. I have to tell you that when my mum was pregnant with me in 1970 and playing golf, she and my father were not elites at Kurri Kurri Golf Club.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, the story of their love affair with golf and that course is something that is very close to my heart. And when you think about it, it's a little patch of dirt where the community came together. They started off building a golf course and they got to nine holes, and then they got to 13 holes, and then they got to 15 holes, and finally we got our 18 holes. Our little course, Kurri Kurri—which is, funnily enough, located in Heddon Greta—became an 18-hole course. That was a real community journey, and that's what it's like for many country golf courses. The courses that may have members that are a little more well-heeled are still great places for community. That's what golf does—it brings people together. It doesn't matter where you go across the world, you can have a game of golf with someone you have never met before and you know what to do. You don't have to be a particularly good player, but you can go and have a game. You can look into someone's personality and character.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Golf is one of those things. Often, you hear that kids don't get taught manners these days—well, I tell you what, if you get your kid playing golf, not only have they got the prospect of potentially becoming a pro and maybe earning a lot of money, but here's what your child will learn: they will learn to wait their turn; they will learn to be quiet and respectful when someone else is having their turn; they will learn that they should not walk across the line of another player; they will learn that they have to dress appropriately and suitably to go and play a sport; and they will learn that you shouldn't wear a hat inside or you will have to shout the bar. These are just some of the rules you learn very quickly in golf. It is a game of etiquette and manners. It is a game of strategy. It is a game for life. Whether you're seven or 107, you can still get out on the golf course, and many people do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Golf not only employs around 28,000 people here in Australia but it also gives many thousands more the opportunity to have recreation. It is one of those things that is also very inspiring. My whole family have played golf since mum and dad joined Kurri Kurri Golf Club. In fact, our house was from here to the Deputy Speaker away from the 12th green, so I pretty much grew up on a golf course. I spent my childhood playing, and it is such an important part of who I am today. I encourage anyone, if they are thinking about having a game of golf, to go and do it. These days, you can play putt-putt golf or you can go to a driving range, and you'll still be considered a golfer. You can start anywhere and you can start with a set of sticks off Gumtree—it doesn't need to cost you the world. What it will do is help you live five years longer, it will bring your blood pressure down—even if you're not playing that well—it'll create a whole network of people and an opportunity to make friends, potentially at a time in your adult life when you may never have thought you would be able to do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear there is a crisis of loneliness across our country, and I would say to anyone, if you are feeling lonely, check out some of your local golf courses—go and get a lesson off one of your local pros. They will help you become a better person. It is great for mental health, and I just want to give a shout out not only to my beautiful home clubs of Kurri Kurri and Newcastle—which is one of the great courses in Australia—but also to Maitland, Horizons, Nelson Bay—I can't wait to play in the Angel Billy in a couple of weeks time—and the mighty Beresfield, a public course that a lot of people still play on. I congratulate all of those people who work so hard and do such a good job of promoting the game. I also congratulate PGA Golf Australia and the WPGA, where we're seeing women and men compete together in tournaments for the first time. Whether it is from the bare beginning of going to Holey Moley, or whether you are out there on the circuit as a professional golfer, golf is the broadest church in Australia in terms of sport, and I would encourage you to worship at every possible opportunity. Long live our golf.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:59</span>):  It is a pleasure to rise on this motion. It's bipartisan, but I do have to disagree with my good friend the member for Paterson—whenever I've played golf, it definitely drove my blood pressure up, but that was more owing to a lack of ability than the game of golf. It is a great game and it's a big part of many communities. In my electorate of Casey, golf plays an important role in a social element but also an economic element, driving golf tourism. We're fortunate to have the Heritage golf course, the RACV club in Healesville, Gardiners Run, Yering Meadows and the Eastern Golf Club all located very close together, and it's been wonderful to work with them on some tourism opportunities in our community. We had the shadow minister for trade and tourism, Kevin Hogan, out. We also met with Yarra Valley tourism to look at what we could do to support those clubs to bring more people to the area to experience the wonderful golf courses of Casey and the Yarra Valley.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, unfortunately, last month we had some bad news at the Eastern Golf Club when it was destroyed by fire. It was burnt to the ground—the pro shop, the lounge, the restaurants. It's a relatively new club, about 10 to 12 years old. It's a beautiful facility, and I've been lucky enough to attend and spend time there with Ben Telley, the general manager. But it burnt down. I want to send my thanks to all the local CFA crews that attended, particularly the Coldstream CFA, who were the first attenders, as well as Victoria Police and Ambulance Victoria. I spoke to Ben Telley on the day of the incident, and luckily no lives were lost and no-one was injured, but it was pretty devastating. I know they're back on their feet, and other clubs, like Gardiners Run, which I'll talk about in a moment, are supporting them, and we're rallying around them. Luckily it's summer, so the tennis court has been repurposed into a facility. As club chairman Fred Jones said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">As a Club with a history that extends back a 100+ years, the loss of our clubhouse is devastating, but it is the loss of irreplaceable trophies, photographs, artworks and memorabilia that hurts most deeply.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to sent my support to everyone at the Eastern Golf Club. Keep up the good work, and we'll keep backing you as you continue to rebuild.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned Gardiners Run. I was lucky enough to attend their 49-year anniversary dinner just a week and a half ago. It's a wonderful golf club run by the Chirnside Park Country Club, and it would be remiss of me not to mention the indominable Barb Kelly, who runs that club and does an amazing job in supporting not only golf but also the wider community. At the 49th anniversary dinner, we had the pleasure to celebrate Bert and Joyce Patrick's 67th wedding anniversary, which was on the day, but they love the club that much. They were founding members; Bert was instrumental in getting the club established 49 years ago. It was wonderful to chat to Bert, catch up with him and hear about how the club was started 49 years ago and about some of the challenges they've had over the journey.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A club like Gardiners Run is so important for our community because, while it's a golf club, it also has many other sports. I want to talk quickly about the bowls club that is connected to the golf club and particularly the event I went to on Monday, just before the cup, the Bowls Gr8 for Brains fundraiser, which clubs from all around the area came to support. I was fortunate to open it and I met with Darryl, who I've met a couple of times now. Bowls Gr8 for Brains do work supporting first responders and veterans that are struggling with post traumatic stress disorder. It's a wonderful organisation and it's an example of how golf clubs and community clubs are bigger than just sport and do more for the community. I also met Shane, Cam, Tony and Mark from Bowl For Your Lives, and it was great to hear their story and the work they're doing using bowls to support first responders. It's another example, as I said, of what the community can do.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Given it was a charity day, there was an auction. There did happen to be a Collingwood 2023 premiership poster, and I know the member for Solomon will be happy about that. I did buy it—he'll be happy to know—because it was my obligation and duty to support that charity. My wife understood, which is the only time I can buy memorabilia! On a serious note, it is a great example. Congratulations to Barb Kelly at Gardiners Run and Bowls Gr8 for Brains for the work they do supporting our community, our first responders and our veterans.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="298840" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr REPACHOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:04</span>):  Golf is a game for all. It's a game that is testing and sometimes frustrating, but it's a game that is exciting and rewarding. Some love it, some hate it, and sometimes even those who love it can hate it. But at the end of the day, no-one can doubt that our world is a much better place because of the game of golf. Golf helps our community and our economy to grow, providing 3.3 billion in annual benefits. The sport encourages spending in the economy on activities and facilities related to golf, with 6.7 billion being spent by local golfers and 3.6 billion being generated by tourism.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Hunter is no exception when it comes to seeing the benefits of golf. We have no shortage of world-class golf courses in the Hunter Valley. Just to name a few: we have the par 71 championship course at the Hunter Valley Golf Club; the Cypress Lakes Golf &amp; Country Club, which was the winner of the best Australian golf hotel resort in 2017, 2018, 2019 and also 2021; and the Vintage Golf Club, which was designed by none other than the Shark himself, Greg Norman. All of these courses are capable of hosting the best golfers in the world, so if the PGA, WPGA or maybe even LIV Golf are looking for a place to host their next major event, look no further: come to the Hunter Valley to play golf and drink some of the world's best wine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Golf really does have something for everyone. If competitive golf or a social game of racing golf carts around 18 holes on a golf course isn't for you, there's also putt putt golf or aqua golf, which can be a great family day out. The Hunter is also lucky to have great venues for putt putt and aqua golf. I know my daughters love it whenever we take them there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here in the Hunter, golf allows us to host massive events like the Jack Newton Celebrity Classic, which brings people from all over the country—including some high-profile personalities—to the Hunter to play some golf for a good cause. I know that even the late, great Bob Hawke was a frequent competitor at this event. Because of golf, events like this are possible. These events give a huge boost to our community and local economy and raise important funds for charities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Golf is good for your health, too. The health benefits of golf are highlighted by the fact that Australian golfers walk around 280 million kilometres annually. It's a good source of exercise and it can be played by people of all ages—from toddlers learning how to hit a ball, to older Australians who want to stay active.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The PGA of Australia, Golf Australia and the WPGA Tour Australasia really have done an amazing job of promoting golf in Australia. Our talented golfers are getting the spotlight they deserve. In fact, just the other day I turned on the TV and saw a young man from my electorate competing in the 2023 Webex Player Series in South Australia. The young man was Corey Lamb, and he has only recently achieved his lifelong dream of becoming a pro golfer. He didn't quite take home the chocolates in this event, but he showed lots of promise by finishing second. I think it's fantastic that young golfers like Corey have the chance to show their skill on the big stage so early in their careers, and I can't wait to watch his career progress.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I play golf, there are two big winners on the day: the pro shop, because I lose a lot of balls and I have to go and buy more after losing them, and the bar, because I like to drown my sorrows after a terrible game. A sport that looks so simple really can be difficult at times. It really makes you admire those who can actually hit a ball straight consistently. But it is always a good day, no matter how many balls I lose. So, whether you play with your mates and have some beers along the way, or whether you take the game a little bit more seriously—get out there and have a hit of golf this weekend. It's good for your health, it's good for our local golf courses and our community as a whole. And, most importantly, it's bloody good fun.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to just talk about one of my favourite golf courses in the Hunter, which is Branxton golf course. Or, as the locals like to call it, 'Royal Branxston'. It's a lovely area. Sometimes when it has been raining, Gos, there are a lot of water views there, the course floods a little bit, but it is one of the best courses in the area for the local golfers to go and just have a really good time—lose a few balls there but enjoy the day as well. To everyone at Branxton golf course: have a great weekend and have a great day playing. I hope everyone enjoys their golf this weekend.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms WARE:</span>
                  </a>  Nonetheless, I support this motion brought by the member for Forde, which brings to this place's attention the importance of the game of golf to our country—economically, financially, socially and also health-wise. I do not profess to be an expert on golf, a regular player of golf or even a semiregular player of golf. However, I was very glad that I was in the chamber to have heard from the members for Lyne, Paterson, Casey and Hunter, who are all clearly very passionate about the sport for the sport's sake.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the few occasions that I've played golf, I have not covered myself in any type of glory. But I will share this story for the sake of embarrassing my husband about the one time that I did actually win a trophy in golf. I was playing with him and my mother-in-law. We were playing Ambrose in a competition out at Lake Cargelligo for a charity event at the time. Mostly due to the efforts of my mother-in-law and me, we won. We won the Bradman prize, and that consisted of two frozen chickens. My husband refused even to get up and accept the frozen chickens, but my mother-in-law and I were not so proud, and we were delighted to have won. That is the one and only time I've ever won any prize in golf, and I do not see myself ever winning another prize.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I am convinced by the terms of this motion in this place that we should acknowledge the tremendous role that the golf industry plays, and I also want to acknowledge the three excellent courses that I have in my electorate of Hughes. We have the Ridge Golf Course and Driving Range at Barden Ridge, Kareela Golf Club at Kareela and also Brighton Lakes Recreation and Golf Club at Moorebank. I was recently out at Brighton Lakes to give them three new flags: the Australian flag, the Aboriginal flag and the Torres Strait Islander flag. It was lovely to have a tour of their facilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some statistics about golf that have been released recently by the Australian golf industry support this motion brought by the member for Forde. They reveal things such as golf provides $3.3 billion in total annual benefits to the Australian economy and the community. There are also significant environmental benefits that are brought by this game. There is a growing and deepening participation in all forms of golf, and golf's estimated annual household expenditure is in the realm of $10.3 billion. Apparently, according to current statistics, 37 per cent of adult Australians, which is over 7.2 million Australians, say they visit a golf course on a fairly regular basis. This is a massive participation sport, and it brings communities together. That is why I think this is a motion that should be supported and we should acknowledge the benefits that golf brings both to local communities and to the country as a whole. The overall contribution to the Australian economy is valued at about $394 million for businesses alone and about $122 million for industry workers. This is yet another example of why the game of golf is very important to our economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, because I am no expert on golf, I left it to Google. I want to reveal a couple of the golfing quotes that came up. There is, of course, Mark Twain, who said: 'Golf is a good walk spoiled.' But then there is Greg Norman who said, 'Happiness is a long walk with a putter.' Tiger Woods—and I've actually read Tiger Woods' biography—said, 'It's funny, the more I practice, the luckier I get.' That was when somebody out in the audience had said to him, after he performed a particularly good shot, 'Wow, that was lucky, Tiger.' That was Tiger's response. But I am a baseball tragic, so I will leave it to Hank Aaron, a prolific player in the fifties, sixties and seventies, who said: 'It took me 17 years to get 3,000 hits in baseball. It took one afternoon on the golf course!' I have sympathy for that!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are living through the era of consequences when it comes to climate change. Extreme weather events, whether they be fires, floods, heat waves or indeed extreme cold snaps have become a new dystopian reality. But we also are now in an era of a responsive government that is trying its hardest to turn this supertanker around. For the first time, after a decade of denial and delay, we have a coherent energy policy. It is a policy that is focused on energy generation, energy distribution and indeed energy storage; three pillars to having a coherent, all-of-society approach to climate change. We legislated targets. This was one of the earliest acts that we performed as a government. We now have legislated targets which take us on a trajectory to net zero, and in just one year we've seen the effects of this investment signal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We started off with renewable energy sitting at 33 per cent; it is now at around 38 or 39 per cent, and that hasn't happened by accident. We have a massive uplift required in order to get us to our 2030 target, which will be 82 per cent renewable energy. Some say that is too ambitious. We think that is achievable, but we realise that we have a lot of work to do. We've also imposed tough emission controls on our heaviest emitters through the safeguard mechanism—actually putting teeth on this mechanism—which it didn't previously have. That means it will be equivalent to taking two-thirds of Australia's cars off the roads. It's actually quite difficult when you think about the emitters that we're actually talking about—big oil, big gas, coal mines and so on—but eventually this same safeguard mechanism will also be invoked for renewable energy projects—gigascale wind farms, for example, critical mineral mines and so on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to this, we have committed $20 billion to Rewiring the Nation to modernise our grid so that it is renewable ready. We've have announced six offshore wind zones, including one off the Bass Strait. This will enable Tasmania to reach an ambitious target of 200 per cent renewable energy. It is an absolutely fantastic announcement. It also means it has partnered us with other groups worldwide in the Global Offshore Wind Alliance. Australia is now a signatory to that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to the next stages, we have announced six sectoral plans. We're taking a sector by sector approach to decarbonise our country. That means we are tailoring plans for the electricity and energy market industry, agriculture, the built environment, transport and the resource sector. With respect to transport, for the first time in Commonwealth history, Australia has a national EV strategy. This strategy was designed with stakeholders and it means that we've introduced tax cuts for electric vehicles, which has resulted in an uplift in sales from two per cent to nine per cent, but we want to go further. This EV strategy is also partnered with $500 million towards a national charging infrastructure, which includes eventually rolling out hydrogen on our highways for our heavy vehicles. With respect to green hydrogen this is a small molecule with big ambitions. We have devoted $2 billion to a Hydrogen Headstart program in our last budget. This will enable Australia to create the liquid fuel that will eventually replace diesel and petrol for our heavy machinery and heavy industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to storage, we want to keep the lights on with green energy, and that's why we have introduced a Capacity Investment Scheme with $10 billion towards it, and it's why we are rolling out 400 community batteries across the nation at a cost of $400 million. But that's not all—we're wrapping integrity around this, because there is a lot of money involved in this transition. Across two budgets, we have committed $40 billion of public money, and this is why we've introduced the National Anti-Corruption Commission. We've also strengthened the Climate Change Authority, a legacy of the Gillard government, and we have pumped another $46 million into this authority that was starved under those opposite. We commissioned the Chubb review to look at offsets, and we also dispensed with the dodgy Kyoto credits of the previous government. We have a lot to do, and the climate piece will be integrating with a lot of other work, including industry and skills.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="008CH" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms DANIEL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:31</span>):  Good, but not good enough—these will be the words that define this government's attempt at climate policy if it continues down the current path. While this government has taken more measures to address the climate crisis than its predecessor, that's no benchmark. This science tells us that the government's 43 per cent emission reduction targets don't even come close to the targets required to help keep the planet below the 1.5 or two degrees of global warning limits set in Paris. As the government stands here and espouses its achievements and goals, Australia lags in its global multinational commitments and misses out on opportunities to become a world-leader in the new international net zero technology economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In May 2022, the Australian people delivered a clear mandate on climate leadership by electing the current government. So when will this government embrace that and begin to treat the climate crisis with the urgency and the ambitious policy it deserves? I wish to voice my concern to the House that evidence suggests Australia is not currently on course. Its 43 per cent reductions goal of 2030, a target which was less than ambitious in the first place, is starting to look like a ceiling, not a floor. We can do better. The inadequate safeguard mechanism, the continued approval of new coal and gas projects, and the fanciful suggestion of capturing carbon and dumping it under the sea all run counter to what we need to achieve. With every day that passes, our job gets harder. We must do better. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So how do we move from good to great? First: dramatically increase investment in Australia's net zero economy. Australia has a generational opportunity to become not only a renewable energy superpower but also a global leader in clean-tech design and manufacturing. We need ambitious policy-making so that we don't become a laggard to the likes of the US and their Inflation Reduction Act, causing us to lose ideas, talent and opportunity. These are not just my words. Industry bodies like the Smart Energy Council, Climate Energy Finance, the ACTU, and the Australian Conservation Foundation are all calling for over $100 billion to take advantage of this historic opportunity. It's time to be bolder and braver.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Second: energy policy that builds faster, cleaner and cheaper community energy. The $20 billion Rewiring the Nation program is an important step in increasing the amount of renewable energy in the grid, while at the same time reducing the cost of energy for Australian households. In the words of the Australian scientist and inventor Saul Griffith, we should electrify everything. We should subsidise and enable the ability for Australians to decarbonise and electrify their households. We should build the EV infrastructure necessary to service an electrified transport system. We should drive home energy generation and storage. If the government is serious about its stated strategic objectives, this is what it takes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Goldstein is an excellent example of the community hunger and support for this type of approach. Village Zero is a community electrification zero waste and environment project seeking a series of community batteries to be shared throughout the Sandringham community, allowing the storage and redistribution of excess solar energy generated to be used by our network during the evening peak. Goldstein is seeking to lead the way in local energy generation, local energy distribution, and lower costs for households, but government support is required to back communities that are prepared to execute this transition at the local level. This is the low-hanging fruit that government should be going for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And three: we need environment laws that work to protect our climate. The current EPBC Act allows the government to continue approving new coal and gas projects, despite organisations like the IPCC telling us that emissions from all existing fossil fuel projects are more than enough to push us beyond 1.5 degrees of warming. Australia Institute research shows that, if all 116 proposed coal and gas projects in the pipeline went ahead, annual emissions from those projects alone would be almost triple our emissions produced in 2021-22. Summoning the resolve to reject new fossil fuels is crucial.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">'Good but not good enough'—these are the words that will ring in our ears if we fail to invest in our future economy, if we fail to invest in our local communities and if we fail to live up to our renewable potential.</span>

The people of Boothby voted overwhelmingly for real action on climate change, and the Albanese government, with Minister Bowen at the helm of this issue, is getting on with this momentous job. After a decade of going backwards, it is a huge job. I'd like to thank the member for Higgins, Dr Ananda-Rajah, for this motion.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thought I'd update my constituents on where the government is acting on climate. We've lifted our country's emission reduction targets by half, from 26 per cent to 43 per cent, and become just one of 33 countries to enshrine those targets, together with net zero, in the law of the land, sending a message to renewable energy investors around the world that Australia has changed and is open and welcome to renewable investment. We legislated to bring the Climate Change Authority back to play a real and meaningful role in advising government—and have properly resourced it. We put net zero in the objects of the CEFC and ARENA Acts to ensure that they keep this goal front of mind when making decisions and made it relevant to other key industries such as Infrastructure Australia and Export Finance Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've legislated our $20 billion Rewiring the Nation fund and struck funding deals for vital new energy infrastructure in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania. We've developed and are implementing a four-point plan for better community engagement on transmission, and we've commissioned a review on what more we can and should do to improve social licence. We finalised the law allowing offshore wind development in Australia, and we've designated the Gippsland and Hunter zones and begun consultation elsewhere. Expressions of interest for Gippsland's licences are being processed, and EOIs will open soon for Hunter.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">After years of talk, we've agreed to the sensible Capacity Investment Scheme with the states, which will unleash at least six gigawatts of dispatchable renewable power and $10 billion of investment. We've launched the first action, with New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia to follow shortly. We've agreed with the states and territories to finally put emissions reduction into the National Energy Objectives so our regulators and operators have it as one of their guiding principles when setting the rules for our energy market. We've agreed with the states and territories to develop the new National Energy Transformation Partnership to help guide public and private investment. We've signed the Global Methane Pledge and joined the Climate Club and Global Offshore Wind Alliance, and we've given the safeguard mechanism teeth, requiring net emissions reductions from our 215 biggest emitters.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've passed the electric vehicle discount. This has driven an increase in electric vehicle sales from around two per cent a year ago to around nine per cent today. We funded, and are about to commence, the rollout of the Driving the Nation charging program, which will see a fast charger every 150 kilometres on average on our highways. We've released the National Electric Vehicle Strategy, including, most importantly, a commitment to implement fuel efficiency standards. We are ahead of our target on the policy of making 75 per cent of Commonwealth-purchased cars low-emissions by 2025, and today chargers were opened in the APH public car park.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We commissioned the independent Chubb review to verify and improve the important carbon credit market, to ensure it's delivering real emissions reductions, and we've committed $1.7 billion to the energy savings program providing real financial support to households, businesses and local governments to invest in renewable energy and energy efficiency. We've signed funding agreements to deliver more than 50 community batteries around Australia. There's one planned for Edwardstown in Boothby, and I'm really keen to see more coming into this area.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the people in Boothby are very concerned about climate change and they're keen to see action. We had Minister Bowen in Boothby last week, engaging with local climate action groups. This government has approved more renewable projects than any previously, and the faster we get renewables online the faster we can phase out fossil fuels—without the blackouts that will kill social licence. This government is committed to this process and we are taking positive steps forward.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HAINES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:40</span>):  I'm a strong supporter of renewable energy and the benefits the transition to renewables could bring to regional Australia. The member for Higgins has highlighted some of the government's work on climate change and energy. However, if the government is to meet its own targets and decarbonise the economy, it must do more to bring the whole nation along on the decarbonisation journey. Australia does have the best renewable energy resources in the world, and the transition to renewable electricity is underway in the regions. In my electorate of Indi, a trip up the Hume Highway from Melbourne to Wodonga will take you past grid-scale solar projects near Glenrowan and Winton.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a regional Independent, I want my local communities, and others like them in regional, rural, and remote Australia, to benefit—to truly benefit—from hosting these large-scale, mostly foreign owned renewable energy developments. This must be a win-win situation. Through job creation, skills development and co-investment, locally generated power could, and should, be driving money into our local regional economies and reducing power bills now and long into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Landholders and farmers, understandably, have questions about the benefits and the impacts of proposed projects close to where they live. Yet their questions and inquiries are too often dismissed as objections to projects and progress, and that's not fair to them. A question becomes an objection if it's not listened to. Regional people are practical, resilient people who look for sensible solutions to new challenges. Regional communities deserve to be consulted early and honestly, to have their concerns listened to and to be provided with options to capitalise on these long-term benefits that can be realised with the renewables boom—a boom that's happening at their farm gate and, in many instances, inside their farm gate. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The failure to properly consult with regional communities affected by large-scale renewable energy projects risks delaying or, indeed, derailing the transition to a decarbonised energy grid. Project developers would do well to listen to the concerns of local people, and I'm pleased that the government is waking up to this. In September, I joined Indi locals from Meadow Creek, the Strathbogie Ranges, Barnawartha and beyond as they had their say about renewable energy projects proposed near to where they live in the electorate of Indi. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Energy Infrastructure Commissioner, Professor Andrew Dyer, visited Indi to conduct three roundtables as part of his community engagement review. The review was established to advise on how best to engage with communities about future renewable energy and transmission projects. Independent senator David Pocock and I worked closely with the Minister for Climate Change and Energy, Minister Chris Bowen, to put the interests of regional Australians front and centre in this review, ensuring that the terms of reference would properly cover both the opportunities and the challenges being faced across regional, rural and remote Australia. The review is considering issues I know are important to regional communities, such as the impact of projects on agricultural land, emergency management and fire risks and the possible increases in landholder insurance premiums. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My communities are telling me about these issues, and what they're also telling me is that community consultation by project developers has been disappointing to date. This is what we need: (1) assurances that renewable energy project developments do not adversely impact the availability or affordability of insurance for neighbouring landholders; (2) land not suitable for renewable energy infrastructure development being clearly mapped, including land that has high agricultural value or fragile ecosystems or is in a high-risk natural disaster zone; (3) community engagement guidelines that require developers to broadly engage local communities early and honestly, with genuine avenues for addressing community concerns; and (4) a requirement that all new large-scale renewable energy projects offer at least 20 per cent of project equity to local investors in a community and co-investment funding round before final planning approval can be granted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are sensible, practical measures grounded in the knowledge and lived experience of farmers and regional Australians. The commissioner's report for the Community Engagement Review is due very soon, and, if the government is serious about successfully transitioning to renewable energy, they must carefully consider and respond to the voices of regional Australians who deserve to be consulted earlier and to have a share in the economic benefits of the renewable energy boom.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:45</span>):  Deadly heatwaves, drought, fire, flood and species extinction: these are just some of the impacts of climate change facing Australia right now. But, unlike the previous coalition government, we are acting. I would like to thank the member for Higgins for moving this motion. As I stand here today, our country stares down yet another bushfire season, with recent fires and floods causing devastation and loss of life and triggering nightmares of previous disasters. As someone who experienced the Ash Wednesday fires, I send my heartfelt condolences to all those impacted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we know is that, in the wake of these disasters, there is no time for procrastination—no time to sit on our hands. Climate change is real, and its impacts are felt every day, not just across our nation but across the globe. In May 2022, the Australian people sent a clear message, electing the Albanese government to urgently address climate change. We are acting on this mandate. We have increased the country's emissions reduction targets from 26 per cent to 43 per cent by 2030, quickly restoring our standing in the world. We've updated our nationally determined contribution under the Paris Agreement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now Australia is back at the table and acting on climate change, with our 2030 target now in line with countries like Canada and Japan. We've reformed the safeguard mechanism to help us deliver more than 200 million tonnes of emissions reduction by 2030, which is the equivalent of taking two-thirds of Australia's cars off the road. By 2030, with the upgrading of the grid, we aim to achieve 82 per cent clean, cheap renewable energy. But the fight against climate change is not just about policy change. It's about collective action. It is about each and every one of us making conscious choices in our daily lives to protect our precious natural world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last few weeks, I visited many projects in my own electorate of Corangamite, where landholders are taking a proactive stance to safeguard our region's unique ecosystems, thanks to federal government funded programs. Local landholders Peter Brew, Simone Koch and Cliff Rossack, among others, have partnered with the Corangamite Catchment Management Authority and the Surf Coast Energy Group to deliver these much-needed programs. I saw firsthand the improvements made to the local environment, including through protecting the Victorian Volcanic Plains near Bannockburn, Spring Creek valley on the Surf Coast and the habitat for the critically endangered birds on the Bellarine Peninsula.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Bannockburn, I saw the grasslands alive with colourful wildflowers, chocolate lilies, native orchids and nationally threatened clover. The property was also a fine example of a cultural burning program, supporting the Wadawurrung Traditional Owners Aboriginal Corporation to conduct cultural burns and other traditional land management practices on public and private land. Spring Creek valley and the protecting biodiversity in the Surf Coast hinterland project has delivered revegetation of farmland and community engagement at two sites along the much-loved stretch of land. The project has achieved revegetation of more than 600 native plants, 250 hours of weed control and the participation of more than 200 volunteers at three community planting days.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Wallington, another project is being delivered to improve the chances of survival for the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot. It includes releasing captive-bred birds to support the wild population in the Bellarine Peninsula and undertaking invasive predator control and habitat improvement works. By investing in these projects, landholders are not only contributing to the protection of our unique ecosystem but also setting an inspiring example for responsible land management. Further opportunities to nurture our environment are on the table, with the minister for the environment's nature repair market bill currently before the Senate. Such policies and local projects show we can and will make a difference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government's commitment to the environment and to climate change action is not just a promise; it is a moral obligation. A cleaner, healthy environment is the foundation upon which we address climate change, and it's imperative we fulfil it for our planet and for future generations.</span>

                  <a href="72184" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GILLESPIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:50</span>):  This is a really important motion, even if it's been relegated up to the Federation Chamber. Everyone in this room is pretty much trying to achieve the same thing, but I'm just calling on everyone to call a timeout and see what is actually achievable. In our current plans, which are 100 per cent relying on transitioning away from fossil fuels and into a renewable energy system, along with changing land use, there will be massive connections of new grids and extra land needed for the production of low-density energy that's randomly variable depending on what the weather is. An individual household or a small isolated entity, once it's built, can go off-grid, relying on solar and wind. If you pay enough money and have enough batteries, you can do that. But you can't do that with an industrial economy. It's just physically impossible, and I'll just go through some of the reasons behind that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The University of Melbourne, Princeton, the University of Queensland and the Nous Group have just spent two years looking at the cost of transitioning away to a renewables future by 2030, along with the other land use things. All we have to do in Australia, to get there by 2030, is spend about $1.5 trillion—that's all. That's a bargain, because the net present value of what we have to spend by 2050 is $5.5 trillion. If it's in the real world—you don't spend it overnight now and get it in 2050—it's $7 trillion to $9 trillion by 2050. We also only have to convert 5.1 million hectares of good agricultural land into native forest, and, depending on whether we've got a hydrogen based economy, we'll need up to 28,000 kilometres of new poles and wires. Considering the national grid is now about 3,500 kilometres from one end to the other, at least the main spine of it—the distribution network is another latticework of stuff, but, for transmission and distribution, if we're going to make hydrogen all over the place its 28,000 kilometres.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we've got a problem with that. None of that is realistic, and that's why they did the study. It copied the same principles that they did on the net zero America study, which came to similar conclusions. But in that net zero study, they included nuclear because it's had a major renaissance and it's expanding everywhere. There's also a bit in this motion about giving a methane pledge, which I have big problems with because they're equating biological methane that comes from bovines with methane that's escaping from a coal plant. It's a closed energy system. Each animal itself is about 15 per cent carbon. So, if you're going to sacrifice a cow of 700 kilos, that's an awful lot of carbon. It's permanent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, with this renewable plan to replace our fossil fuels, we don't have enough minerals. We are going to reach peak minerals before we reach peak oil. The amount of minerals in copper alone—and I'm quoting Professor Simon Michaux, University of Queensland trained, who now heads the highly respected Geological Survey of Finland, which is the equivalent of the US Geological Survey or Geoscience. He's highly respected. The amount of copper mined through history, to now, is about 700 million tonnes. The world's total reserves of copper are 880 million tonnes, and that's according to the US Geological Survey. We will need, in the next 22 years, 700 million tonnes. If we're going to be recycling all the batteries, by 2050 we're going to need about 6.1 billion tonnes of copper, which is clearly not possible. We will have to mine 8.8 times more copper than has ever been mined since mining started. That is not realistic. Never mind all the rare earth batteries. It's just unbelievable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With global reserves, we need a 12-week, 84-day buffer of stationary power storage to go off, and we don't have enough minerals to make batteries, let alone all the cars. Siemens, Orsted and CIP are all going broke, because the economics of wind power is only there if it gets huge subsidies. That's why they're all going broke. And none of the wind options are being taken up by anyone. So we really need to think that, if you're going to defossilise the economy, nuclear is the way to go. Everyone in Europe has worked that out. Everyone in America has worked that out.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's an air of excitement in the halls this week. November 13 to 16 marks Youth Voice in Parliament Week, which kicks off this week in Canberra. This year, the question is asked: what change would make Australia a better place for future generations? It seems apt for me to share the voice of one young northern Tasmanian who has answered this question. Hazel Doyle was the Bass winner of the Raise Our Voice competition last year and has again submitted a fantastic piece worth raising here today. Fourteen-year-old Hazel says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">What would make Australia a better place for future generations is improvement in the awareness of youth in Australian politics (to an appropriate degree). This would also provide better youth inclusivity in parliament. Not just older youth, for example 18 or 19 year olds, but younger youth as well, like 12 or 13 year olds. As a young person myself, I know that until I got involved with the Raise Our Voice program, I didn't think about our government or decisions being made, or the impact that might have in my future. I wasn't even aware about anything going on and I know the same is true for my friends and other children in similar age groups.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I was told politics was an 'adult thing' and I should not know or talk about it. However, I strongly disagree with that. I think it's very important to make politics and decisions in parliament that impact youth a more common topic to discuss with young people. This would help us to know what is going on in our country, the country we will inherit, and the decisions that will impact us growing up. This will also help us have a more informed perspective and understanding of our country as soon as we turn 18 and are allowed to vote. This means our input through voting is better educated. I believe that this can be achieved by creating political news stories, through a magazine for example that comes from our government, about political decisions that impact youth and are appropriate for youth. We could also make this a more talked about topic in schools, a place that shapes us as people, by encouraging the watching of the show BTN and encouraging conversations about mentioned topics on BTN in class.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Overall, Australian youth needs to be better informed and generally aware about politics that impact them to give us a better educated understanding of our future, especially 18 year olds when it's a first for them being able to vote and have a real say in our future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What Hazel has outlined in her speech is supported by what I hear when I'm out in my electorate, particularly when I head out to schools, where I'm fortunate to engage in some no-holds-barred Q&amp;A sessions with students. Just a few weeks ago, I was at St Anthony's Catholic School in the West Tamar area, and a student asked me if I thought the voting age should be lowered to 16. The response I gave to the student is also worth sharing today. Lowering the voting age brings a number of complexities and challenges that would need to be worked through. I believe that elected representatives across all levels of government need to engage more deeply with our constituents who do not yet have the privilege of voting. We should be encouraging discussions, feedback and ideas from under-18s and taking these views to Canberra, just as we would for anyone in our electorate of voting age. It's our responsibility to show that their voices are heard and that their views do matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've always spoken out against the notion of creating policy for the short-term electoral cycle, looking beyond to create and enable policies that will deliver long-term solutions to some of the issues that are most concerning our young people today, from climate change to housing affordability, education access and intergenerational equality. With a passion for and a focus on long-term prosperity for the youth of today, I was proud to co-form the Parliamentary Friends for Future Generations group with the member for Mackellar and the member for Swan. Our multipartisan group acknowledges our responsibility to protect the interests of future generations of Australia, and the group brings together representatives from the private, public and social sectors to advance how Australia might best protect its future generations. There are many evidence-based examples from around the world to look to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on the government to take a whole-of-government approach to consider the needs of future generations and I also encourage colleagues in the House and the Senate to join us tomorrow night for an end-of-year symposium at which we will also launch the intergenerational fairness coalition, which is a great chance to hear compelling calls to action from a range of advocates and stakeholders for the future generations policy agenda.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Issues that are top of mind for young people include the environment and climate change, mental health, and equity and discrimination. Young people have long been at the forefront of change, taking to the streets and getting involved in campaigns. Young adults are also enthusiastic about democratic and civil engagement, including volunteer work. Research in 2021 by the University of Melbourne found high levels of engagement in supporting sports clubs, helping with church services, organising charity events, providing free legal and medical advice and accounting assistance, and supporting other young people with mental health issues.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But while young people are passionate and engaged, we also know that young people's confidence and trust in political institutions and processes is low. One research study, the Our Lives project, which began in 2006 and has followed a large group of Queenslanders from adolescence into adulthood, found that participants' trust in politicians has dramatically declined. In 2006, 29 per cent of the cohort indicated that they trusted politicians—11 years later, in 2017, that number had dropped to just nine per cent. We must show that we are listening to young people so that they will re-engage with politics. The importance of this can't be overstated. Trust in government and trust in our key institutions is critical for democracy to operate effectively. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has identified trust as one of the most important foundations upon which the legitimacy and sustainability of political systems is built.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it came to government, Labor knew that young people were feeling disaffected because their ideas and experiences were not being listened to or taken seriously by politicians. Over the past year or more, our government has worked hard to turn that around. One of the first things that Dr Anne Aly did as the Minister for Youth was re-established the federal office for youth, a unit in the Department of Education that listens to young people, that advocates, and that is improving policies across government that affect young people. Minister Aly also established a youth steering committee to advise on government policies and programs that affect young people, while five youth advisory groups have been providing advice to the government in five areas: climate change and energy; Indigenous Australians; mental health and suicide prevention; industry and science; and social services.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tonight, it is my privilege to read a speech written by Taihan Rahman. At just 14 years old, this year-nine student from my electorate of Fraser is already making a great contribution, including being the youngest of the aforementioned 14-member youth steering committee. Taihan's interests lie in issues such as social justice, cultural discrimination and education inequality. In his speech, he speaks passionately about the need to invest in education, a theme that resonates with our government. In Taihan's words:</span>

Even if they can't all vote, they soon will, and it's vital that we listen to them. It's vital that their voices matter. </span>

They visit primary schools to talk about climate change and encourage younger students to write to the Prime Minister and ministers urging them to take action to reduce carbon emissions. These two young people blew me away. Charlie and Eadie are leading the way with their positive and inspiring message of hope and action.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">And just last week, I met with another impressive young person from Victoria called Anjali Sharma, who is part of a group of young people advocating for political leaders to act and safeguard the futures of younger generations from drastic climate change impacts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These young people are not just talking about climate, they're talking about meaningful steps to get us, as members of parliament, to listen. Anjali is leading a brave group of teenagers who are campaigning for parliament to pass the climate duty of care bill which Senator David Pocock introduced in August. The bill would ensure the decisions we make may result in substantial greenhouse gas emissions and must consider the impact they have on the health and wellbeing of Australian children and future generations.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It feels rather corny to say that young people are our future and, in fact, young people must be sick to death of hearing this. Young people are our now and they are already having an impact. I'm proud to bring their voices to this parliament today.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:21</span>):  We partly came to government on a rising tide of young people who were disaffected with the stale politics of the previous administration, but it is clear that we have much to do. There is a generation of young people who simply do not feel like they are heard, and they can identify the issues; they relate to the intergenerational divide and to climate justice. The issues that come up time and time again are climate, housing, wealth creation and financial security, noting that many young people have cottoned on to the fact that the 'bank of mum and dad' has become the default wealth distributor in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Young people feel left out of the conversation, and we in the Albanese government are well aware of this. That is why we established the federal Office for Youth—to rebuild trust with young people and to create a structural mechanism to embed their voices in government to influence and shape policy. In addition to this, we established the Youth Steering Committee, made up of 14 diverse young people, and we have also extended this with advisory groups. The previous year, we had advisory groups on climate change and energy; Indigenous Australians; mental health and suicide prevention; industry and science; and social services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the voices of young people, they are wise beyond their years. Sophie, in my electorate, speaks about violence against women and children. She says:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, the court system is a long and exhausting process that for me lasted four years from the time I was 12 to 16 years old and no statistic can demonstrate what I went through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I was forced to grow up in year seven when most of my friends' greatest worries were on the next math test. I had to think about him being around the corner or showing up at my house or my school despite the restraining orders.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Talks to mediators who insisted on phone calls telling me I could leave the room if I felt uncomfortable and when I did in tears, I was rushed back in to continue. Constantly having to talk to court representatives to get my side of the story in here.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Small">… we must improve how we treat people in court, victims and children alike with respect, compassion and as people. We need to educate both women and men about what domestic violence is and work on prevention.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hear, hear, Sophie! That is why we introduced reforms this year to put victims-survivors at the centre of our response in the justice system. We are investing $14.7 million into criminal justice reform to improve the way the criminal justice system responds so it doesn't retraumatise victims. This includes establishing an Australian Law Reform Commission inquiry into law reform and investing $8.2 million towards small-scale trials for primary prevention and early intervention, in a national first. These trials will build the evidence base and help guide our response.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… It is undeniable that every child deserves a high-quality education to prepare them for their futures, because if we don't secure the success of the next generations, then how can we expect our country to prosper?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Neglecting our children is a form of national self-harm, and as Australians we all must demand better. Regardless of their socio-economic status, Aussie kids deserve the best education.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hear, hear! We're currently working on extensive reforms in early childhood education, the middle years and indeed the university sector through the Universities Accord process.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Words matter. Words have morphed into a vessel in which we as humans used to effectively communicate, and yet they have surpassed such rudimentary origins.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Today, I stand before you to urge our executive government to take a significant step towards securing a sustainable future for our children and youth by signing the Intergovernmental Declaration on Children, Youth, and Climate Action.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The effects of climate change exacerbate existing geographic, socioeconomic and developmental inequities in society. One of our country's greatest challenges is intergenerational inequity. The young people of this generation will enter adulthood with a significant burden of debt associated with their tertiary studies. Many will struggle to rent or buy homes anywhere near where they want to work. As they enter the workforce, they will assume the burden of a narrowing tax base struggling to fund the increasing cost of disability and aged care. The biggest challenge though is climate change. The cost of our decisions not to act or to act too slowly on climate change will be borne by today's children and their children. We already know that that cost will be too high.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1992 all Australian governments agreed that intergenerational equity is a core principle of climate policy, but, despite this commitment, the health and future wellbeing of young Australians has not been at the heart of our economic decision-making or of our climate and environmental legislation. We have no 'youth trigger'—no legislative mechanism specifically requiring that the interests of young people are considered when we make laws that will affect them. This parliament must be prevented from making significant decisions involving the exploration or extraction of coal, oil or gas where the resulting greenhouse gas emissions are likely to pose a material risk of harm to the health and wellbeing of current and future Australian children.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As my young constituent Zac has requested, I also commit to the premises of the Intergovernmental Declaration on Children, Youth and Climate Action. Federal politicians should be required to consider the impact of laws we make on the health and wellbeing of current and future Australian children. Whether or not the people in this place choose to accept it, I maintain that we owe the next generation a duty of care.</span>
